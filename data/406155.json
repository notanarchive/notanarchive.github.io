{"itemid":1586,"subject":"Marathon Time!","event":"Yes, we're doing it again.\r\n\r\nFebruary begins Marathon Month at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.  We may not boast the colossal screens of IMAX theatres, but we do have a pretty cool medium-sized screen, bigger than your TV sets, and we'll be presenting the entire fourth season of GAME OF THRONES on it, starting February 17.\r\n\r\nWe did think of showing all of the first four seasons, but that's forty hours of television, and we would have needed to start around Thanksgiving if we wanted weekly screenings.  So we decided to restrict ourselves to a single season this time around.  We ran the first three seasons last year, after all.  And there's plenty of spectacular fun to be had in season four.\r\n\r\nYou remember:\r\n<lj-embed id=\"543\"/>\r\n\r\nWe'll be showing two episodes a week, on Tuesday nights, for five weeks.  The schedule:\r\n\r\n   TUESDAY  February 17           episodes 401 & 402\r\n   TUESDAY  February 24           episodes 403 & 404\r\n   TUESDAY  March 3               episodes 405 & 406\r\n   TUESDAY  March 10              episodes 407 & 408\r\n   TUESDAY  March 17              episodes 409 & 410\r\n\r\nWherever possible, we will also feature cast members, writers, and directors answering audience questions after the episodes... most via Skype, but we are hoping to arrange some personal appearances as well.  Sibel Kekilli and Pedro Pascal have already agreed to Skype in with us.  More to come.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is, sorry, you cannot buy tickets for these shows.  The good news is, <b><span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">ALL SCREENINGS ARE FREE</b></span>.  First come, first seated will be the rule, just like it was last year... and do recall, the Cocteau has only 125 - 130 seats.  We expect every one to be filled.  Last year we had people lining up before the sun rose.\r\n\r\nOf course, we will have plenty of GAME OF THRONES merchandise for sale... along with signed books... special Westeros-themed cocktails... and our justly famous buttered popcorn.\r\n\r\nSee you there, I hope!","ditemid":406155,"eventtime":"2015-02-03 23:45:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1423951110,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Marathon Time! http://j.mp/1xd0kZh","picture_keyword":"enthroned","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.61231121304104]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1423032337}","revtime":1424240723},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-02-04 06:44:43","anum":139,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html","event_timestamp":1423007100,"reply_count":9,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124565084/74200088","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20239755#t20239755","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20239755#t20239755","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20239755#t20239755","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2997436","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Milerys71","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20239755,"talkid":79061,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20239755#t20239755","upictitle":"Alexandra Iturry: pic#124565084","article":"Thanks Lord of the dragons in the storm, the wonderful world of westeros<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"February 4 2015, 15:41:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"THANKS","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Milerys71","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Milerys71","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2997436","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=74200088&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Milerys71","ctime_ts":1423064478,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20240523#t20240523","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20240523#t20240523","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20240523#t20240523","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jacked_knight","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jacked-knight.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20240523,"talkid":79064,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/406155.html?thread=20240523#t20240523","upictitle":"jacked_knight: pic#0","article":"I would die for a slice of Manderly's famous lamprey pie!
