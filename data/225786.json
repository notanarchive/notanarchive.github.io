While I still recall the highlights (Joe Beth in Lexington, Kentucky and Kepler's in Menlo Park, California) of that first signing tour, I recall the lowlights even better -- the St. Louis signing where the only four people in the cafe/ bookstore actually LEFT when I got up to speak, and the Dallas signing where I drew a dozen people while Clifford the Big Red Dog drew hundreds.  And here we are, fifteen years later, with GAME at number one on the list.  Where's that dog now, I want a rematch!\r\n\r\nThanks to David and Dan and HBO, they had a lot to do with this.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to you, my readers, as well.  No promotion, no advertising, no marketing campaign can ever hope to match word of mouth.  Without the loyalty and enthusiasm of my fans, none of this would ever have happened.\r\n\r\nI hope you all have a great Fourth.  It's certainly going to be a good one for me.","ditemid":225786,"eventtime":"2011-07-04 11:12:00","props":{"taglist":"a song of ice and fire, game of thrones","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1310047989,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"tiger","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":2,"revtime":1310054035},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-04 17:12:16","anum":250,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225786.html","event_timestamp":1309777920,"reply_count":143,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109928961/14519384","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225786.html?thread=14039802#t14039802","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225786.html?thread=14039802#t14039802","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225786.html?thread=14039802#t14039802","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225786.html?thread=14039802#t14039802","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aniloratka","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aniloratka.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14039802,"talkid":54842,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225786.html?thread=14039802#t14039802","upictitle":"aniloratka: A Game of Thrones {Jon}","article":"<i>No promotion, no advertising, no marketing campaign can ever hope to match word of mouth.</i><br />oh I agree so much.
