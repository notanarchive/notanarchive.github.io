This is not a \"who is your favorite character?\" poll.  This is a \"which miniature do you want?\" poll.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing how it comes out.","ditemid":35847,"eventtime":"2008-02-12 18:38:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":89,"opt_nocomments":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-13 01:40:46","anum":7,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35847.html","event_timestamp":1202841480,"reply_count":0}
