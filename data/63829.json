{"itemid":249,"subject":"It's Good to Have Two Teams","event":"The Jets game... sigh... what can I say?  \r\n\r\nAside from \"same old Jets.\"\r\n\r\nBrett Favre looked his age this afternoon.  Every long ball was underthrown, except the last one that Coles bobbled, and the short passes had no zip.  \r\n\r\nHey, Dolphins, can we please have Chad back?\r\n\r\nThat was a painful few hours.  It's a familiar pain.  I have been a Jets fan for a long time, and by now you'd think I'd know that they just play well in the early season to get your hopes up, so that the inevitable collapse will be that much more painful when it comes.\r\n\r\nThe Giants - Panthers game restored my faith in life and the NFL.  What a great game.  Hard-fought from beginning to end, seesawing back and forth, full of great plays on both sides.  Especially on offense.  The defenses got slugged around a little.  I am concerned that our D did not sack Jake Delhomme once.  Our pass rush seems to come and go these days, and with the playoffs near that worries me.  But Brandon Jacobs returned in a big way, Derrick Ward was amazing, and the O-line were opening holes I could have run through.  Let's hope it's THIS version of the G-men who show up for the playoffs, not the guys we've seen the past two weeks.  Anyway, we've got the bye and home field throughout... let the wild rumpus begin!","ditemid":63829,"eventtime":"2008-12-21 23:46:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":244,"commentalter":1230358005,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-12-22 06:54:46","anum":85,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html","event_timestamp":1229903160,"reply_count":53,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/71431243/2741085","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html?replyto=4858709","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html?thread=4858709#t4858709","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html?thread=4858709#t4858709","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html?thread=4858709#t4858709","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html?thread=4858709#t4858709","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cjkelly04","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cjkelly04.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4858709,"talkid":18979,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63829.html?thread=4858709#t4858709","upictitle":"cjkelly04: pic#71431243","article":"Hey, sorry about the jets, but I gotta say, it was great to see the seahawks win our last home game of the season, and the last home game with the great Mike Holmgren.

Now with the whole, \"Pay us $3000 per seat, and you can keep your season tickets...IF you also pay $110 per seat, per game\" thing, he may end up giving them up.<br /><br />Phil Sims was the last of the greats. HE was a football player. He may not have been the best, but he was loyal. He was a GIANT!! No switching teams for him. He stuck with the Giants through that awful losing streak that lasted a million and a half years. I have to be honest--I was disappointed that Favre moved to the Jets. I thought he was going to be one of those loyal guys who stuck with his team to the bitter end. There's no loyalty in football anymore. Coaches and teammates switch and change. It was very nice to see Favre congratulate Holmgren so warmly--they'd been player/coach for Greenbay after all. Freaking Parcels has coached half the teams in the NFL by now!
