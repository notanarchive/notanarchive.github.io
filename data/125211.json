{"itemid":489,"subject":"Giants D","event":"Various sources are reporting the Pepper Johnson might be a candidate for the defensive coordinator opening on the Giants, created when Bill Sheridan was released.\r\n\r\nThat would be a risk, maybe -- Pepper doesn't have the experience of most of the other candidates -- but it's one I'd be glad to take.  I have fond memories of Pepper from his days in the Giants defense of the late 80s and early 90s.  He was always a fiery competition, a real leader, and the Giants defense desperately needs some fire right now.  The last thing we want is another Xs and Os guy like Sheridan.  Pepper has never been a coordinator... but neither had Steve Spagnuolo until Coughlin hired him, and Spags was great.\r\n\r\nOther reported contenders include Dick Jauron, Romeo Crennel, Percy Fewell, Bob Sutton, and George Edwards.  Some of them might be okay... but if it was me, I'd go for Pepper.","ditemid":125211,"eventtime":"2010-01-06 13:56:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":155,"taglist":"nfl","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1263506062,"interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"17:22,11:27,23:5,16:11,25:5,26:5,39:11,9:33,13:38,nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-01-06 20:56:22","anum":27,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125211.html","event_timestamp":1262786160,"reply_count":20,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125211.html?replyto=8237083","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125211.html?thread=8237083#t8237083","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125211.html?thread=8237083#t8237083","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125211.html?thread=8237083#t8237083","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"minrude","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://minrude.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8237083,"talkid":32176,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125211.html?thread=8237083#t8237083","article":"Tyrion would make a great defensive coordinator.
