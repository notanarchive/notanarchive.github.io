The other 47(?) contestants in question seemed to hold positions that stated that evolution should be taught in conjunction with other ideas.<br /><br />Sadly, all of the contestants and most (even educated) people don't understand the issue.  Religious folks think they have a problem with evolution, but they don't -- they have a problem with Naturalism (mostly: young earth creationists abuse the Hebrew text and torture it to confess to things that even Jews 3000 years ago didn't believe, so of course they have problems with evolution. And cosmology).  <br /><br />There is another group just as guilty of abusing the same text to the same extent, and it is those who attempt to use the 7-day creation poem in Genesis and other portions of the text to try and \"prove\" that science and religion (the usual target is Christianity) are incompatible.<br /><br />The fact is that science is observation.  We have observed change over time in existing species.  But all should realize that evolution is a very nuanced idea, and that there are many components of it that are not understood, such as what mechanism drives it. Darwin's natural selection was a great idea for his time, but most biologists do not accept it as the sole driving force.  Punctuated Equilibrium is a start, but many organisms have shown the ability to evolve exactly how they needed to exactly when they needed to, and this idea is just being explored within the last few years.  Check out the book Quantum Evolution by JohnJoe McFadden if you would like to learn more about this absolutely fascinating aspect of biology.  <br /><br />On another note, ideas like BioLogos (championed by Francis Collins, one of the heads of the Human Genome Sequencing project), completely reconcile what is observed of our natural world with belief in a Creator (in Collins' case, the Christian God).  He and those like him accomplish this by treating science as what it is (observation of our natural world) and treating their religious texts as what they are and were intended to be (in the case of Genesis, God's revelation to a pre-scientific Ancient Near Eastern culture). <br /><br />In essence, the theory of evolution says nothing of how everything came to exist.  Naturalism is the idea that everything is the result of natural processes, and that there is no Creator.  That's the argument I wish these contestants had addressed, or understood.  But it's hard to blame them when most people have the same blind spot.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 28 2011, 19:14:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Re: contestants on evolution","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://enochlisi.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"enochlisi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"enochlisi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://enochlisi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"enochlisi","ctime_ts":1309288469,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13928737#t13928737","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13928737#t13928737","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13928737#t13928737","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"joeymet","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://joeymet.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13928737,"talkid":54409,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13928737#t13928737","above":13926945,"upictitle":"joeymet: pic#96080625","article":"That's all very true, but it's beside the point. And to be fair, it's difficult for the public to keep up with this stuff. Punctuated Equilibrium is just starting to gain traction, so let's give it some time before we start decrying the public's ignorance of it. The REAL  argument essentially boils down to science vs religion, and if creationism should be taught at all, be it alongside evolution or no. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the Religious Right has made the PC way of posing this question to do so in the reverse: should EVOLUTION be taught in schools. That way the focus--and therefore, the burden of proof--is shifted away from creationism. It also allows zealots to sound fair and critical by hiding it behind phony arguments against evolution, rather than espousing Young-Earth thumpery. It also allows politicians to pander to the religious without alienating their centrist base.<br /><br />What I do take issue with is that an attempt should be made to reconcile faith with science. They are natural enemies. Religion requires ignorance and obedience, and the blessed few who can maintain their faith while practicing such advanced science as the genome project do so by putting up blindspots of their own, because you CAN'T reconcile the two. Yeah, you can select certain passages that are vague enough to be taken as metaphor, but there's also a lot of things that are just flat wrong in these texts, and the only way to truly reconcile those items is to pretend they don't exist. Or allow for some other concession, such as the ever-popular \"Well, it was written by men, after all,\" as if that doesn't render the whole book fallible. <br /><br />No, Mr. Collins has not reconciled his faith with his science. He's carved a new faith out of his old one. And more power to him, but let's not pretend he's found the loophole.

We here in Germany have three subjects students from age 12 and up can choose from for themselves (younger students have to take what their parents tell them to) which are 'Catholic religion', 'Protestant religion' and 'Ethics' (for non-Christian students and those who want a more comparative approach). 'Islamic religion' has been in the talks for a while because of our large percentage of Islamic immigrants, but we don't have enough state-certified Islam teachers yet.<br /><br />Secularization is neat, me being an atheist and all, but it can and does bear the most rotten of fruits when a society is not ready for it. Give the Christian lobby in the US not what they WANT (pseudo-scientific blabber in science classes), but what they NEED (the option to teach religion as an independent subject in all school forms and years).<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","below":13931553,"ctime":"June 29 2011, 05:34:29 UTC","parent":13926945,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: contestants on evolution","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://geierkreisen.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"geierkreisen","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"geierkreisen","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://geierkreisen.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"geierkreisen","ctime_ts":1309325669,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13931553#t13931553","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13931553#t13931553","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13931553#t13931553","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"unna_rainchaser","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://unna-rainchaser.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13931553,"talkid":54420,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13931553#t13931553","above":13929505,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","parent":13926945,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: contestants on evolution","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://unna-rainchaser.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"unna_rainchaser","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"unna_rainchaser","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://unna-rainchaser.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"unna_rainchaser","ctime_ts":1309349783,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/105291077/30377336","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927713#t13927713","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927713#t13927713","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927713#t13927713","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"yellowblackhaze","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://yellowblackhaze.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13927713,"talkid":54405,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927713#t13927713","upictitle":"yellowblackhaze: blanket Linus","article":"Striking a blow for geeks everywhere!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 28 2011, 22:15:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://yellowblackhaze.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"yellowblackhaze","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"yellowblackhaze","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://yellowblackhaze.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"yellowblackhaze","ctime_ts":1309299336,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/80827051/1112886","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927969#t13927969","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927969#t13927969","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927969#t13927969","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"diabolikal","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://diabolikal.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13927969,"talkid":54406,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/223777.html?thread=13927969#t13927969","upictitle":"Ryan: pic#80827051","article":"It seems that copies of Dance have in fact been leaked and there are spoilers being spilled everywhere.
