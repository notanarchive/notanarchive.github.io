I must admit that I read thru Feast much too quickly. I may just have to go back and start the series over again while waiting for Dance to finish...<br /><br />If you ever have computer or PDA problems of any type, please feel free to give me a shout. I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.<br /><br />Wishing you gobs of creative productivity...<br /><br /><br />Christopher Spera<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"July 5 2007, 23:11:15 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Glad you&#39;re not so lonely","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://chrisspera.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"chrisspera","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"chrisspera","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://chrisspera.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"chrisspera","ctime_ts":1183677075,"tracked":0}]}
