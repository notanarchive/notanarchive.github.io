{"itemid":26,"subject":"A Quick Note From Anaheim","event":"Worldcon is over, but I'm still here, logging on from the business center in the bowels of the Anaheim Hilton.  I'm lingering for a few days post-con to Do Meetings with my film agents and other Hollywood folk.\r\n\r\nIt was a good con, and as usual the Brotherhood Without Banners had the best parties at the convention.  The Human Chess Match was a hoot and a half as well, and Daniel had me really worried for a while there.\r\n\r\nI did lose the Hugo, alas.  Indeed, I finished an ignonimous fifth out of five.  Win some, lose some and all that.  The award went to SPIN by Robert Charles Wilson, a really terrific novel and a very worthy winner.  Losing doesn't sting nearly as much when you're beaten by a book that good, so I am pretty philosophical about all this (unlike, say, Philadelphia in 2001).  No need for condolences, folks, really.\r\n\r\nI got to pass out plenty of Hugo Loser ribbons too.  This year marked the 30th anniversary of the Hugo Losers Party, and we wanted to celebrate the occasion.  The first one was held in my room at the 1976 worldcon in Kansas City, Big Mac... still the best and most innovative of modern worldcons.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I was pretty pleased with the Hugo results.  It was particularly gratifying to see rockets go to Donato Giancola, David Hartwell, and Peter S. Beagle (though I would have loved to see Beagle tie with Howard Waldrop, since they both deserved Hugos).\r\n\r\nLots more to report on, but this business center time is expensive, so I'll save all that until I get home.\r\n\r\nI fly back to New Mexico tomorrow, and it's back to work the day after.","ditemid":6852,"eventtime":"2006-08-29 13:04:00","props":{"commentalter":1158177966,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2006-08-29 20:14:30","anum":196,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6852.html","event_timestamp":1156856640,"reply_count":122,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/38764220/2070594","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6852.html?replyto=562628","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6852.html?thread=562628#t562628","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6852.html?thread=562628#t562628","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6852.html?thread=562628#t562628","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dirtntrees","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dirtntrees.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":562628,"talkid":2197,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6852.html?thread=562628#t562628","upictitle":"dirtntrees: House Lannister","article":"I will have to check out \"Spin\", as I just finished re-reading ACOK and am in need of new fiction, and any book off your reccomend is worth the look-see.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about you not winning, but the idea of loser ribbons is fantastic.

I just discovered this non-blog and thought I would ask them here instead. I have often wondered how it is that you make the chapters of your \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" books flow like scenes in a movie whilst jumping from character to character. It is perhaps my favorite style of chapter formatting I have read in the fantasy genre. I have often wondered how you make the broad stroke of the story and then decide to use certain characters to tell it. The deft technique of drawing many characters over many timelines and many miles (in the novel of course) into a nexus is what really blows me away every time I read the series (I reread it every time there is a new book...just to refresh my memory). In this post I noted that you work on/revise one character for a time and then move onto another. This confused me a bit because there is often a large gap in time between characters and their chapters. So I went over the first book and only read Eddard's chapters to see how you could possibly think out the chapters/timelines that far in advance. I cannot divine your method. Do you write a massive amount of material and then go back and remove bits? Do you actually write it out character/chapter by character/chapter and then fine tune the individual character entries later? Did you know what the endgame was going to be and who was going to be a major player or does it just come out organically and you work around a loose outline?

And because I know you are absolutely dying to find out why I am asking this inane question, I shall tell you.  I'm a Brit ex-pat living in Denmark, I have been an avid SF&F reader since my parents presented me with the 7 books in the Narnia series at the (I think) precocious age of 6 3/4.   Huge fan of yours, and tons of others: David Gemmell (ever read his stuff??) Stephen Donaldson, Terry Brooks, Robin Hobb to name but a few.....and why is she telling me this you may ask yourself, well, it's because, living in Denmark, a country supposedly steeped in ancient history and mystery....there is a positive dearth of anything remotely attuned to the fantasy world.   I have to save money and buy all my reading materials from foreign countries when on holiday, usually takes up over half of my husband's luggage allowance.  So back to the point in question, your inspiration...here's me living in a country with axe swinging viking skeletons waiting to be uncovered and written about.....and there's you, living in the US,
