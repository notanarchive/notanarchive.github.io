{"itemid":1393,"subject":"This Weekend at the Jean Cocteau","event":"We like to boast that the Jean Cocteau Cinema is Santa Fe&#39;s most eclectic movie theatre.&nbsp; That truth has never been more in evidence than it will be this upcoming weekend, when we are opening <b><i>five</i></b> (count &#39;em, 5) very different films.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNT is a serious drama, starring Mads Mikkelsen, and one of the finalists for this year&#39;s Best Foreign Film category in the Oscars.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"404\" />\r\n\r\nWELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a raucous, raunchy comedy, featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme in his first comedic role.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"405\" />\r\n\r\nROMEO &amp; JULIET, our Valentine&#39;s Day special, is of course the Bard&#39;s most romantic play.&nbsp; It&#39;s been put on film countless times, as the Shakespeare fans out there know.&nbsp; The one we&#39;re showing is the best, in my not so humble opinion: the gorgeous 1968 version directed by Franco Zeffirelli, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey.&nbsp; Back in 1968, Zeffirelli&#39;s ROMEO &amp; JULIET was both widely acclaimed and highly controversial, since he took the radical and unheard-of steps of casting actual teenagers as the teenaged Romeo &amp; Juliet, instead of actors in their forties.&nbsp; Makes it a whole new play, I think.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"406\" />\r\n\r\nOur midnight show is A TRAP FOR CINDERELLA, an offbeat thriller. (Our midnight shows start at 11:00 pm, Friday and Saturday).\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"407\" />\r\n\r\nAnd fifth, but not least, come Saturday noon we&#39;re showing THE IRON GIANT, a personal favorite, as our children&#39;s matinee.&nbsp; <b><i>All kids under 12 admitted free.</i></b>\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"408\" />\r\n\r\nSomething for all tastes, I think.\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies.","ditemid":356665,"eventtime":"2014-02-12 11:10:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, films","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1392487640,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"revtime":1392619938},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-02-12 18:10:55","anum":57,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356665.html","event_timestamp":1392203400,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124463911/701220","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356665.html?thread=18713145#t18713145","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356665.html?thread=18713145#t18713145","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356665.html?thread=18713145#t18713145","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"13masquerade","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18713145,"talkid":73098,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356665.html?thread=18713145#t18713145","upictitle":"13MAC: 2014decemberphoto","article":"..I'd definitely fly just for the thought of exploring.
