I'm an Administrator from the Game of Thrones Wiki, and Wikia set up a Wikia Fan Panel for Game of Thrones at NYCC.  So far the guests consist of Kristian Nairn (Hodor) and Natalia Tena (Hodor) - apparently it's the only primarily Game of Thrones panel at NYCC this year <br /><br />I live in New York City, and I'm an Administrator for Game of Thrones Wiki, so Wikia is having me co-run the panel.  <br /><br />Yesterday I found out that David J. Peterson will also be at the convention on Sunday, so I asked if he was interested in swinging by our panel on Thursday, to promote his new book \"Living Language Dothraki\".  To my surprise he expressed interest - I don't know if he'll \"officially\" come but I forwarded this info to my superiors at Wikia so they can figure something out with him.  <br /><br />Is there any chance you will be in town for the convention?<br /><br />If not, no problem.  Moreover I've been trying to forward something to \"the writers\" such as you or Cogman for two years now:  the wiki Admins are not the smallfolk fans who constantly ask \"hey, who's Jon Snow's mother?\" or \"who is your favorite character?\" (for the Nth time, Tyrion!)......so I started keeping a running list of \"questions about lore that we'd ask the writers if we ever get in contact with them\" -- it's around 70 questions long now.  I call it the Cargo Cult.  <br /><br />http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Foru<wbr />m:The_Cargo_Cult  -- please take a look if at all possible, and if not, please forward/delegate to \"TV loremaster\" Cogman.  <br /><br />I will point out very briefly the bigger questions:<br /><br />1 - The TV continuity removed Jaehaerys II, despite the fact that his sister is the one who married a Baratheon.  We have no idea how Stannis and Shireen descend from the Targaryens now and can't draw a family tree demonstrating this.  We need clarification.  <br /><br />2 - The House Florent family tree on the TV show is very jumbled up and we need clarification (\"Axel Florent\" is now Selyse's brother?)<br /><br />3 - What is the command structure of the Night's Watch?  Yes, the First Ranger is head of the Rangers...but is he like an aid to the Lord Commander at Castle Black?  What if the First Ranger tells the rangers at the Shadow Tower to do one thing, but Denys Mallister tells them to do another?  I don't know how to draw an organizational chart of how this functions. <br /><br />4 - What is the current year within the TV series?  A while ago I came up with the functional explanation that because props in Season 1 were labeled as \"298 AL\" that both book 1 and Season 1 take place in that year...thus because Robert's Rebellion happened \"17 years ago\" that means it started two years \"earlier\" (relatively).  But the TV series also seems to have a principle that one season equals one year (while one book did not always equal one year).  The result being that I think Season 4 took place in 301 AL, not 300 AL.  It's surprisingly difficult to maintain an accurate timeline for TV series events on the wiki when we're just saying \"a year after that happened\" instead of a firm dating system.
