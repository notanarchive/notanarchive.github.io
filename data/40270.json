{"itemid":157,"subject":"Football Natterings","event":"The Giants have just signed David Carr to back up Eli at QB.  It's a one-year one-mil contract, so the risk is not great, but I'm not thrilled.  Carr is a former #1 overall draft pick, just like Eli was a couple of years later, but Carr had the misfortune to be drafted by the Texans, where he played human pinata for five years.  He's been sacked way more than any other QB in the NFL over the same time span, and I fear may have had his potential knocked out of him.  If Eli goes down, I'd much rather see Jared Lorenzen coming in behind center.  The Hefty Lefty has a bigger arm than Carr, and much more upside.\r\n\r\nOh, well.  Maybe Eli will prove to be as indestructible as his brother Peyton.  Knock wood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Jets have gone on a MAJOR free agent shopping spree.  Alan Faneca, Kris Jenkins, Damian Woody, Calvin Pace, Tony Richardson.  Maybe Ty Law too, we'll see.  Some of the new additions are older than I'd like, but still, Mangini's boys should be considerably better next year... and unlike some, I still trust in Chad as our QB.  With a solid offensive line protecting him, he can be very effective, \"weak arm\" or no.","ditemid":40270,"eventtime":"2008-03-13 14:34:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":220,"commentalter":1207776912,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-03-13 20:48:03","anum":78,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html","event_timestamp":1205418840,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/62822792/548965","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?replyto=3640142","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3640142#t3640142","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3640142#t3640142","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3640142#t3640142","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"fontosaurus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://fontosaurus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3640142,"talkid":14219,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3640142#t3640142","upictitle":"Fontboy: Fontosaurus 2","article":"Carr also suffered from some poor coaching -- he has mechanics problems that they should have beat out of him by now and haven't.

They managed to trade trade for a nice defensive tackle in Stroud which should help their offensive line.  This is especially a bonus for Schobel.  On offensive they've got a good run game lead by Lynch.  They've got a QB who has a lot of potential in Edwards.

But today's blog has tied my nostrils together in confusion.<br /><br />Natterings. Football natterings. The seasons over friend. The games of three years have come and been play-by-played and ended in the time that I, your loyal reader has denied that you were ignoring me. I've decried to the masses, \"At least he is letting us know what is going on! We want our work to be it's best!\" But truly, we shall stand here and scratch our jeans and speak into our shirt collars while our desires go unmet.<br /><br />We want a book, George. We would LOVE a book. We all want a book from you so badly that, were you to announce today that you were done, we would call our loved ones and tell them that a book they have never heard of is finally finished and we would ask them, \"Isn't that exciting?\" <br /><br />If there are evil blood weavils leaching your creativity and the only way you can suspend their anchor in your mind is to blog for a moment or two, so be it. Make it a blog that tells me your mind is on a book that is aimed at my bookshelf. Make the blog a brilliant ploy that will put my mind at ease by its wit and humor and a reference to a nearly finished piece of written art. Connect to me, not by typing \"natterings\", but by expressing matters that relate to my desire to read more of what you would have me buy at a bookstore. <br /><br />I care little about football, but I care about how many pairs of shoes I have to purchase as I scrape my feet on the pavement waiting for my next installment to arrive of one of the best stories ever written. <br /><br />I promise to forgive you for not so-called connecting with me. You'll make up for while I am connecting with you over 700 pages or so of immersive, written bliss.<br /><br />Finish your book.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"March 15 2008, 01:17:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Natterings?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://znoesser.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"znoesser","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"znoesser","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://znoesser.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"znoesser","ctime_ts":1205543872,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/15056969/2587761","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?replyto=3660366","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660366#t3660366","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660366#t3660366","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660366#t3660366","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"whitehead","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://whitehead.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3660366,"talkid":14298,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660366#t3660366","above":3659342,"upictitle":"sheridan whitehead: gallagher","article":"znoesser, football season is NEVER over. <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"March 15 2008, 07:14:17 UTC","parent":3659342,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Natterings?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://whitehead.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"whitehead","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"whitehead","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://whitehead.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"whitehead","ctime_ts":1205565257,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/72583166/15151480","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?replyto=3659854","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3659854#t3659854","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3659854#t3659854","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3659854#t3659854","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lorayto","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lorayto.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3659854,"talkid":14296,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3659854#t3659854","upictitle":"Lowell: little buddha","article":"I like the Carr move . . . because if he's on your team, he's not on my team.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"March 15 2008, 01:49:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lorayto.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lorayto","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lorayto","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lorayto.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lorayto","ctime_ts":1205545788,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/15056969/2587761","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?replyto=3660878","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660878#t3660878","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660878#t3660878","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660878#t3660878","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"whitehead","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://whitehead.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3660878,"talkid":14300,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40270.html?thread=3660878#t3660878","upictitle":"sheridan whitehead: gallagher","article":"Faneca is a tremendous run blocker.
