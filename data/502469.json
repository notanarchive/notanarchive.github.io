I think it may still be running -if you go to the library website there is a description of the exhibit. But basically, it treats the 1860 election as though it were going on today with coverage of Lincoln, Douglas, Breckenridge & Bell and the commentator is the late great (& sorely missed) Tim Russert. We sat through it 3-4 times because we were having such fun hearing people say \"Who said that?\" \"What party is that guy?\" & generally being amazed at how the parties have changed or switched positions over time, to say nothing of the campaign tactics they used. If you're ever even near Springfield, the library is marvelous, & if you have kids beginning to study the Civil War -they make it all so much more real than a collection of battles, generals & dates.<br />   Tonight's debate was...well, I'm very relieved to put it in the rearview mirror, my 1st debate memory was probably '68 or '72, but the road has led steeply downhill. Let's hope we demand a higher standard for the country and reject the \"reality\" TV model. Stephen King said it well -\"I like my fiction straight.\" We can do better.
