{"itemid":931,"subject":"After the Emmys","event":"For those of you who may have been hiding under a rock since Sunday... or maybe watching the Falcons/ Eagles game when you should have been wtching the Emmycast... the big news here is that Peter Dinklage won the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor for this portrayal of Tyrion Lannister in HBO's GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nGoes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that all of us from GOT were thrilled by Peter's win.  Much deserved.  And only the first of many, I suspect.\r\n\r\nGAME lost out in the other three ctegories where we had nominations, alas... including BEst Drmaatic Series, where MAD MEN took home the Emmy for the fourth straight year.  But as the beloved Brooklyn Dodgers of my youth used to say, \"Wait'll Next Year.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emmy festivities have changed immensely since the last time I ws up for one (for BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, back in 1989 or so).  The weekend was a blur of pre-parties, post-parties, receptions, gifting lounges, red carpets, and limos.  Parris and I got to lift a glass or three with Peter, David & Dan and their lovely wives, Mark Addy, Lena Headey, Michelle Fairley, Kit Harrington, Jason Momoa, and Nicholaj Coster-Waldau, and some of the cast from BOARDWALK EMPIRE as well.  I met lots of very cool people, and was astonished and delighted by how many fans the series -- both the TV series AND the books -- has in Hollywood, even on other networks and series.  (Keep a sharp eye out in future weeks for GOT nods on a couple of your favorite comedies).\r\n\r\nBut now to work.  I'm still in LA, and will be here for the rest of the week, but from this point on it's mostly meetings.  But more good stuff may come out of those as well... one hopes...","ditemid":238588,"eventtime":"2011-09-20 11:52:00","props":{"current_location":"beverly hills","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":40,"commentalter":1317227099,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"iron throne","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1317248175},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-09-20 18:52:57","anum":252,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/238588.html","event_timestamp":1316519520,"reply_count":66,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/238588.html?thread=14712316#t14712316","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/238588.html?thread=14712316#t14712316","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/238588.html?thread=14712316#t14712316","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"barnaby_jonez","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://barnaby-jonez.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14712316,"talkid":57469,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/238588.html?thread=14712316#t14712316","upictitle":"barnaby_jonez: pic#113167713","article":"Definitely deserved for Peter, but AGOT was robbed by Mad Men.
