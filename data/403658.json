{"itemid":1576,"subject":"A Tease from IMAX","event":"If you happen to live in or near a town with an IMAX theater, it may be that you&#39;ll be one of the lucky ones who will get to see GAME OF THRONES on the big, big, <b><span style=\"font-size:1.8em;\">BIG</span></b> screen on January 29.\r\n\r\nHBO will be screening the last two episodes from season 4 -- &quot;Watchers on the Walls&quot; and &quot;The Children&quot; -- at selected IMAX theatres for one week only.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a taste:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"535\"/>\r\n\r\nAlas, the Jean Cocteau does not have an IMAX screen.&nbsp; There is an IMAX down in Albuquerque, but last I heard, it was not one of the theatres selected for those promotion, so New Mexicans are out of luck.\r\n\r\nBut not completely -- the Jean Cocteau WILL be doing another free GAME OF THRONES marathon this year, screening all of the episodes from season four on our... alas... modest medium-sized screen.&nbsp; We do hope to have cast and crew joining us via Skype, however.&nbsp; So watch this space closely for details, and go to the Cocteau web site and sign up for our newsletter.\r\n\r\nAnd all you folks who have an IMAX near at hand, enjoy the spectacle.","ditemid":403658,"eventtime":"2015-01-20 19:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hbo, movie theatre, game of
