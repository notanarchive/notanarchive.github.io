{"itemid":63,"subject":"The Best Science Fiction Film of All Time?","event":"So, it's been thirty years since we first saw STAR WARS.  Hard to believe.  \r\n\r\nAmidst all the hype and hoopla of this anniversary, I keep seeing people calling STAR WARS \"the best science fiction film of all time.\"  Uh... really?  I don't think so.  The original STAR WARS was a good movie, and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was even better (Leigh Brackett wrote that one, so there's good reason), but RETURN OF THE JEDI went downhill, and you really don't want to get me started about those three wretched prequels.  Even the original triad hasn't aged as gracefully as one might have hoped.  It has become apparent that much of the charm of the first movie came from the novelty of seeing favorite tropes from classic SF books realized on the screen for the first time... but that charm wears off on repeated viewings, and once it does you realize that neither the story is, well... not all that it could have been.  You also realize how much retrofitting and backfill has gone on since the movie's first release.  I don't care what Lucas says, I will never believe that Darth was meant to Luke's father from the outset, or that the romantic pairing was always supposed to be Leia and Han (it is plainly Luke and Leia)... and damn it, Han shoots first!\r\n\r\nNever mind about all that.  STAR WARS is what it is, and it had a profound effect on both SF and on film, for both good and ill... but it is not even close to being the best SF movie of all time.\r\n\r\nWhat's better?  Try 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Try THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Try the first ALIEN, or even better, ALIENS (but never mention the third installment in my presence).  Try CHARLIE (the film version of the classic \"Flowers for Algernon\").  All worthy.  Try George Pal's wonderful adaptation of H.G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS (a better film than the Spielberg remake, in my opinion), or Pal's version of THE TIME MACHINE (a MUCH better film than the really truly abominable recent remake).\r\n\r\nThe best, though?\r\n\r\nMGM, 1956.  Leslie Nielson, Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon, Robbie the Robot.  FORBIDDEN PLANET.  Also known as the Tempest on Altair-4.  Inspired by Shakespeare, in turn it inspired Gene Roddenberry, who borrowed heavily from it when coming up with STAR TREK.  State of the art special effects (for 1956, admittedly), gripping story, some fine performances (especially by Walter Pidgeon, whose performance as Morbius beats anything ever seen in any of the STAR WARS films).  Unlike STAR WARS, this is a film that only grows richer every time you watch it.  A monster that makes sense, characters with a little psychological depth, science that isn't just empty technobabble, a sexy heroine, a tragic hero, the awesome caverns of the Krel... FORBIDDEN PLANET has it all.\r\n\r\nWinner and still champion.\r\n\r\nThe best science fiction film of all time.","ditemid":16260,"eventtime":"2007-05-30 15:18:00","props":{"commentalter":1359831687,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-05-30 21:46:10","anum":132,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html","event_timestamp":1180538280,"reply_count":141,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/52123779/10816978","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?replyto=1948292","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1948292#t1948292","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1948292#t1948292","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1948292#t1948292","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lemuriapress","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lemuriapress.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1948292,"talkid":7610,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1948292#t1948292","article":"According to Steve Haffner, who has read the script, Brackett's original draft was not used at all, and the film was credited in part to her out of respect.

But in the end, Kubrick loves taking mystery and making it defiantly unintelligible to the audience.  The glacial pacing of his films isn't \"artisict\" but sheer self-indulgence, and breaks the contract of the filmmaker with audience to tell at least a visually coherent story.

This is something that very little in the way of science fiction does anymore, or really EVER did, especially when it comes to the cinemazation of scifi.  The Day the Earth Stood Still meets that criterion, and while it might not be perfect (surprise--the aliens look just like...humans!), it is the best of the best of the best in cinema.

I agree that the Star Wars franchise hasn't produced anything similar in intellectual depth to any of these films. The acclaim for the original trilogy is that it captured a wide spectrum of audience and that it was a hit in the mainstream. It certainly deserves credit for that. But calling it the best SF movie of all times will be committing the folly of equating popularity with quality. Not that something can't be both, just that it's not a given. <br /><br />That said, I think some of the high-ranking that Star Wars enjoys is in part a nostalgic vote from those who grew up with the films. They are not really voting for the film, <i>per se</i>, but more about voting for that warm glow of reliving fleeting moments of childhood/adolescent joy.

I first saw it when I was about 3. It's stuck with me ever since and I'll always love it. I think it's this love that fans have for it that makes it widely viewed as the best sci-fi film ever. You also have to admit that it did help popularize sci-fi. Everything we have today probably wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Star Wars.<br /><br />With that said, sci-fi has been a huge part of my life. Forbidden Planet especially. I remember constantly watching it when I was young. It and Star Wars were two of my favorite things to watch. Heck, I grew up with The X-Files as well. The first episode aired just days after my fourth birthday. i was with the series till the end. Sci-fi as a whole has made me who I am today.<br /><br />Now, I love anything by Joss Whedon. He truly is a master of the art form. Firefly and Serenity are two of the greatest pieces of sci-fi work ever.<br /><br />I guess I'm saying this because I think sci-fi shouldn't be judged on just one series or film when there's so much that has given to the genre.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"May 30 2007, 22:09:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://master-fisto.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"master_fisto","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"master_fisto","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://master-fisto.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"master_fisto","ctime_ts":1180562992,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?replyto=1953156","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1953156#t1953156","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1953156#t1953156","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1953156#t1953156","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"pc_loadletter","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://pc-loadletter.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1953156,"talkid":7629,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1953156#t1953156","above":1950852,"upictitle":"pc_loadletter: pic#21461717","article":"I was about to prepare my mumblemumbleFireflymumbleSerenity post, when I saw that you beat me to it.

But wow, such not-good-storytelling!<br /><br />I eventually saw them in the theatre when they did the back to back releases in the 90s, and then I finally got it.  Those movies are *made* for the big screen.  The awe and delight of the Epicness of it all helps take away from the bad acting and awful scripts (though Empire's pretty good, all things considered).

Far from perfect, yes, but an intense and rewatchable movie that makes you both feel and think.<br /><br />Roughly contemporaneous was the PBS adaptation of UrsulaK's <b>The Lathe of Heaven</b>, which is even more amazing when you realize it was done on a budget that might best be described as \"laughable.\" They captured the book, but (unlike the first couple of Harry Potter flicks) they didn't forget that they were making a movie -- they didn't just \"film the book,\" they <i>adapated</i> it.<br /><br />If you want to go back a bit further for something that has shown longterm staying power, a couple of HG Wells films come to mind: <b>Things to Come</b> (which, yes, does get a bit preachy toward the end, as did HGW), and <b>The Invisible Man</b>. Or for that matter the classic <b>Frankenstein</b>, which for all its messingsabout with Shelley's luminously dark plot, conveyed a great deal in a short space.<br /><br />Or more recent: First, I almost feel guilty mentioning it, but <b>The Matrix</b> -- <i>not</i> its loathesome sequel! -- looks to me like it will wind up sitting on the classics shelf in time, after we get over all the bullet-time SFX mania u.s.w.<br /><br />I guess I'm not really <i>arguing</i> with you (I have not the presumption), but suggesting that there is no single \"best\" SF film of all time.<br /><br />Certainly not <b>Star Wars</b>; on that we are in compleat accord, sir.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"May 30 2007, 22:56:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sturgeonslawyer.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sturgeonslawyer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sturgeonslawyer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sturgeonslawyer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sturgeonslawyer","ctime_ts":1180565815,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/55739831/6989558","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?replyto=1956228","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1956228#t1956228","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1956228#t1956228","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1956228#t1956228","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kizeesh","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kizeesh.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1956228,"talkid":7641,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/16260.html?thread=1956228#t1956228","upictitle":"A boy named Finn: Fun!","article":"Star Wars not all it's cracked up to be?
