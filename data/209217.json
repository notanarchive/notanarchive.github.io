The Scouring was so central to Tolkien's overall tone, but I understand that as a film it may have seemed as something of a downer (and an anticlimactic end for Saruman).<br /><br />Love that you have Princess Bride on there as well. It's one of those movies, next to Willy Wonka (the original film version), that just gets better as I get older and the jokes make more and more sense.<br /><br />I wonder if you saw the film adaptation of Stardust. It loses some of the magic in the transition, including the achingly beautiful ending, but I thought it was a good example of how to adapt and change a story from page to screen.<br /><br />It's been a long time since Lord of the Rings put fantasy front and center, and while some good stuff, like Pan's Labyrinth, has been released since then, it seems that Twilight and its ilk have overtaken the supernatural.

While I think \"Fellowship\" has its flaws, it is probably as good an adaptation of the book as is possible, and it might deserve a spot in the top 10 if just for that reason.  But with \"The Two Towers\" Jackson went from simplifying so he could adapt a complex story into a movie to adding new scenes and ideas to the story. It was not an improvement, and \"Return\" was more of the same.  But even as flawed adaptations of a beloved story, the second two were flawed movies, in as much as I found myself checking my watch while watching both of them in the theater.<br /><br />Perhaps surprisingly, given that, you and I are pretty much in agreement for the rest of your list.  I haven't seen \"Dark City\", so I can't say there.  And while The Labyrinth of the Fawn is a great movie, I am not sure I would include it here, since I think (as you speculate) that it isn't really a fantasy as much as it is a story about fantasy as escape.  I would probably include \"Conan the Barbarian\" somewhere lower on the list (Arnold isn't a great choice for Conan as he was written, but the rest of the cast was strong and the soundtrack was as strong as \"Ladyhawke\"s was weak.  The story, while a mish-mash of various Conan stories, satisfies) and slide \"Time Bandits\" in somewhere high on the list.<br /><br />Like you, find \"Excalibur\" a strange beast.  I hated it when it came out, then learned to accept (or ignore) its flaws and delight in the dialogue and acting; when they work, they work very, very well.  \"Legend\" falls into the 'guilty pleasures' range; it has its moments, but also its very curious flaws.  When my son asked to see it, we started out watching the Director's Cut, and while it doesn't explain those flaws, the fact that the released movie was so different from what was originally envisioned does explain some of the movie's oddities.<br /><br />Finally, \"La Belle et La Bete\" was one of the first movies I bought when I finally got a DVD player.  Most modern fantasy fans haven't seen it, so it wouldn't be on most folks top-ten lists, but it would be if they saw it.<br /><br />Now I need to go back and look at the SF list...<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"April 12 2011, 17:32:56 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://vnend.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"vnend","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"vnend","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://vnend.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"vnend","ctime_ts":1302629576,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209217.html?thread=12922945#t12922945","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209217.html?thread=12922945#t12922945","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209217.html?thread=12922945#t12922945","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"maxlongstreet","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://maxlongstreet.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12922945,"talkid":50480,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209217.html?thread=12922945#t12922945","above":12914753,"upictitle":"maxlongstreet: pic#0","article":"Agree with you on LotR.
