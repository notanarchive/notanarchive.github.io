In 2011, four years later, they lost to the then unbeaten Green Bay Packers in the 12th game, 35-38. The Packers would go on to lose one game and finish 15-1, and the Giants defeated them in the Divisional Round.<br />Now, four years later, they lose to another undefeated team, the Carolina Panthers, 35-38. Once every four years losing to unbeaten teams whose team name starts with P by the same score.<br />Now, that's weird, and would be weirder if they came back to play the Panthers in the playoff and beat them.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 20 2015, 21:26:53 UTC","parent":23269145,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: JETS-GIANTS!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/duane.freese","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Duane Freese","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2901182","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73337414&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 21 2015, 05:59:48 UTC","dname":"Duane Freese","ctime_ts":1450646813,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125316185/74260388","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459545.html?thread=23269913#t23269913","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459545.html?thread=23269913#t23269913","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459545.html?thread=23269913#t23269913","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sir_caleb_stark","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sir-caleb-stark.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23269913,"talkid":90898,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459545.html?thread=23269913#t23269913","upictitle":"sir_caleb_stark: pic#125316185","article":"Sire, it's been a long road since I picked up a game of thrones from a buddy to read in what little down time I had between patrols and fighting. I fell in love with them like millions of others. The shows on Hbo are great as well but like most people agree the book is always better and that has been the case for me. I have stuck by and patiently waited and even had your back on here multiple times when fans get after you for not having books out. But I can't stomach the thought of HBO spoiling the books for me by giving me the main plots and leaving only small pieces such as a different character doing something major. I truly hope you manage to get Twow out before hand but more then that I would just like an update. As a loyal fan I don't think that's asking too much because soon I have to decide wether to forgo one of my favorite tv shows to wait for your book and hope someone doesn't spoil it for me which is impossible or ruin the book by watching the show. A simple ballpark update would suffice me sire. Of course your a millionaire and the greatest novelist of our time and you don't have to do so but I do think you owe us your loyal readers something! Thanks for your time.
