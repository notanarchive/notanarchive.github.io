But your strategy on acting categories has been horrible. No drama has gotten in more than 2 noms per category ever since 2007 when blue ribbon panels determined the nominees. Submitting all your cast as supporting will always limit your chances and the highest you can get will always be 4. I know that actors from your show has less screentime than other shows leads but that doesn't matter anymore since the rules have been changed and voters don't have to see the submitted tapes anymore. Peter Dinklage would definitely stand a chance in Lead category with popularity vote and that way you will be able to secure at least one other sup.actor nomination from your cast. (Preferably Alfie Allen) Another thing that came with popularity vote is that  vote-splitting. You guys won all those awards except the category that you were double-nominated can't be a coincidence.(Headey&Clarke). Even if Dinklage&someone get nominated in the same category you would be splitting your shows support and they will end up losing. And for what? Another thing about this subject is that, with the new guest rule; all regular cast members are allowed to submit themselves in guest categories if they appear in less than shows aired episodes on the season(In this case magic number is 4) Conleth Hill was eligible last year but HBO didn't submit him. The category was already pretty weak, so he definitely would have stood a chance and would be an Emmy nominee now. Hope you'd inform your cast members about  these topics. As a show that has become the most awarded series in a single year you guys have faar less acting nominations than those other shows. That has to change. Thanks. Would be appreciate it if you give any kind of signal to show that you read my message.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"February 27 2016, 11:10:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/110316791505926049277","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Daphne Rovian","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3320624","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76856957&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Daphne Rovian","ctime_ts":1456571447,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475141.html?thread=24068101#t24068101","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475141.html?thread=24068101#t24068101","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475141.html?thread=24068101#t24068101","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24068101,"talkid":94016,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475141.html?thread=24068101#t24068101","above":24062469,"upictitle":"George R.R.
