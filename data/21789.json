{"itemid":85,"subject":"You Can't Win Them All","event":"Well, at least my teams won one of them yesterday.\r\n\r\nIf you had asked me on Friday how this week's games would go, I would have told you that I expected the Jets to defeat Buffalo pretty easily, but that I was worried about the Giants against Philadelphia.  The Bills had the worst defense in the NFL, after all, and were giving a rookie quarterback his first start to boot, while the Eagles were coming off a huge win where they scored 50+ points and would be going against a Giants D that had played one good half in three prior games.\r\n\r\nWell, as Chris Berman likes to say, \"that's why they play the games.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jets made the Bills' rookie QB Trent Edwards look like the second coming of Johnny Unitas, while my man Chad threw two ghastly interceptions.  \r\n\r\nCome the night game, however, the Giants D looked like what a Giants D is supposed to look like.  A monster game by Osi, and the entire Giants defensive line... admittedly against a banged-up Eagles team that was missing their best running back.  I've always been a fan of defensive football, and must admit that I enjoy games like this one much more than shootouts like the Giants/ Cowboys game that opened the season.  The fact that we won this one and lost that one may be part of it too, but still... \r\n\r\nThis was a sweet one.  It is always sweet to beat the Eagles, of course (almost, but not quite, as sweet as it is to beat the hated Cowboys), but it was especially sweet on a day when the Mets completed a truly epic collapse.\r\n\r\nNext weekend the Giants play the Jets, so at least one of my teams will win.  Going by the way the two teams played yesterday, you'd have the figure that the Giants will be prohibitive favorites.  Which probably means that the Jets will win.","ditemid":21789,"eventtime":"2007-10-01 14:47:00","props":{"commentalter":1193091224,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-10-01 21:00:36","anum":29,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html","event_timestamp":1191250020,"reply_count":87,"comments":[{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"blanx73","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://blanx73.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2571549,"talkid":10045,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html?thread=2571549#t2571549","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://blanx73.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"blanx73","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"blanx73","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://blanx73.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"blanx73","ctime_ts":1191272690,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html?replyto=2571805","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html?thread=2571805#t2571805","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html?thread=2571805#t2571805","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html?thread=2571805#t2571805","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"zephee","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://zephee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2571805,"talkid":10046,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/21789.html?thread=2571805#t2571805","upictitle":"zephee: pic#66683111","article":"So who are you going to root for.

Even if Westbrook had been in the game I really don't think the score would have been much different. Maybe by 7 points at most. <br /><br />The weirdest thing about yesterday was how little the loss bothered me, having basked in the joy of the Phillies' division-clinching win earlier that day.
