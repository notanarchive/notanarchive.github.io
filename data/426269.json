{"itemid":1665,"subject":"LOCUS Nominations Announced","event":"LOCUS has just released its list of finalists for this year's Locus Awards.  I am pleased and proud that ROGUES, last year's big crossgenre anthology from Gardner Dozois and yours truly, earned a nomination for Best Original Anthology.\r\n\r\nIn addition, three of the stories in the ROGUES have also been nominated in their respective categories: \"The Lightning Tree\" by Patrick Rothfuss in Novella, and Joe Abercrombie's \"Tough Times All Over\" and Scott Lynch's \"A Year and a Day in old Theradane\" in Novelette.\r\n\r\nYou can find the complete list of finalists here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/05/2015-locus-awards-finalists/\r\n\r\nWhile this year, admittedly, may be different due to the influence of the slate campaigns, over most of the past couple of decades the Locus Poll has traditionally had significantly more participants than the Hugo nomination process.  Looking over the Locus list, one cannot help but think that this is probably what the Hugo ballot would have looked like, if the Puppies had not decided to game the system this year.\r\n\r\nIs it a better list or a worse one?  Opinions may differ.  The proof is in the reading.\r\n\r\nIn any case, congratulations to Scott, Patrick, and Joe, and thanks to everyone who nominated their stories, and ROGUES.  We're glad you liked the book.  Gardner and I loved doing it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/249517/249517_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">","ditemid":426269,"eventtime":"2015-05-04 19:20:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"locus awards, anthologies, awards","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1431455783,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"LOCUS Nominations Announced http://goo.gl/GqbDH7","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.669062861155029]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430789060}","revtime":1433455219},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-05-05 01:20:34","anum":29,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html","event_timestamp":1430767200,"reply_count":28,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123618612/71412910","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21599773#t21599773","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21599773#t21599773","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21599773#t21599773","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21599773#t21599773","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2647816","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/jordan.ray2","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21599773,"talkid":84374,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21599773#t21599773","upictitle":"Jordan Ray: pic#123618612","article":"I love all of your anthologies, and Rogues surely deserves the recognition.

I don't dispute that characterization--now that I think about it, it was a young-man-coming-of-age story--but when I read it and its even better sequel it simply didn't occur to me that I was reading YA.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 5 2015, 14:51:07 UTC","parent":21601821,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Much more sensible categories","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rongibson.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rongibson","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rongibson","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rongibson.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rongibson","ctime_ts":1430837467,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124213365/72917550","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21603869#t21603869","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21603869#t21603869","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21603869#t21603869","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21603869#t21603869","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2864961","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/rasmus.manson","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21603869,"talkid":84390,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21603869#t21603869","upictitle":"Rasmus B Wayne: pic#124213365","article":"Speaking of things outside of A Song of Ice and Fire, will there ever be a sequel to Fevre Dream?

It's a different kind of story than ASOIF, though.  I'd call it \"historical fantasy\".  It's set in the age of steamer ships on US rivers, and I'm not a historian, but it \"feels\" very well-researched and historically accurate.  If you're a fan of steamers or that era in general, I think you'll really enjoy it.  If you hated Huck Finn because they spent too much time on the river, then Fevre Dream might not be for you.<br /><br />I would also suggest The Armageddon Rag, but I would suggest reading it in a specific way:  Each chapter of the book quotes one (or more) classic songs.  All of the songs are available on iTunes, so at the beginning of each chapter, I would download the music, listen to it, and then read the chapter.  Listening to the music really helped the book \"click\" with me.  I'd love to see a multimedia edition of the book that would come with all of the music in a bundle, but that would probably be a copyright nightmare, and I think GRRM already went through one of those when he wrote the book in the first place.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","below":21628189,"ctime":"May 10 2015, 03:29:06 UTC","parent":21608477,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Fevre dream","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2246029","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Frank Probst","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2587046","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70873652&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Frank Probst","ctime_ts":1431228546,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21628189#t21628189","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21628189#t21628189","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21628189#t21628189","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2996472","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008844485113","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21628189,"talkid":84485,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21628189#t21628189","above":21623325,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","parent":21608477,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Fevre dream","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008844485113","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"James Rutledge Roesch","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2996472","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=74190926&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"James Rutledge Roesch","ctime_ts":1431316479,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/41801969/287591","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21604125#t21604125","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21604125#t21604125","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21604125#t21604125","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sinboy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sinboy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21604125,"talkid":84391,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21604125#t21604125","upictitle":"sinboy: side profile","article":"Congratulations on your nomination.

So I attempted to do my part to support the Hugos.  It wasn't much...Hah! <br /><br />I read exclusively on 'devices' now (I can set the font on HUGE and avoid donning reading glasses). B&N and Amazon both provide 'free' samples of most e-books I care to read. I make good use of the service.<br /><br />I downloaded and read the free sample of Goblin Emperor.  I felt awash in smooth, flowing prose.  The writing was lovely, the characters succinct and Maia was endearing.  I didn't however get the feeling that my gobbo fantasies of bomb-lobbing, Warg-wrestling miscreants were going to be realized in this story.  I searched out reviews which confirmed my suspicions.  I didn't purchase it.  It is on my long list in case I run out of material, but mostly it's a bit too contemplative for my lacking attention span.<br /><br />I downloaded and attempted to read the free sample for Three Body Problem but only read about 5 pages.  I just couldn't find any reason to read further.  It seemed like a solid well-written story, just not my kind of thing.  TOO realistic perhaps.  It was hard on the empathy synapse in my brain.  Obviously I didn't purchase it. <br /><br />From the little bit I rad the two stories seemed like polar opposites in style.  One made me feel languorous the other unsettled.  <br /><br />I then saw this post which prompted me to download and read Rogues free sample.  I had, of course, seen this book around but short stories don't usually make the cut for me.  This time when I ran out of'free' content I was left hanging onto a mysterious package that had been passed through half-a-dozen new acquaintances in the streets of Sipani.  I only hope I see some of these characters in future Lord Grimdark stories.  I bought the book.  Gillian Flynn's story was up next.  It was good. She's an author I probably wouldn't have sought out as a stand-alone, but man she packed a lot into that little story. Tonight after work, I indulge in more words written by Rothfuss (absorbed slowly and with regard).<br /><br />So to sum things up.  I'm not in fandom.  I'm purely a consumer.  I'm not voting in the Hugos.  I had contemplated joining but it seemed disingenuous to join and vote simply due to political controversy.  I only followed this whole thing out of morbid curiosity after witnessing gamergate attack the indie gaming community (Then I kinda got hooked on Not A Blog).  I trust that those who are invested in producing good quality literature will continue to recognize and reward the talents and successes of their own. I respect those opinions.  The Hugo and/or Nebula seal on a book was a tool I used heavily for years to help me find good books at the book store.  But that was once upon a time when a book cover was the first thing that caused me to pick up a book. With e-books the cover is typically just a poorly adapted, memory-hogging graphic that I hardly notice.<br /><br />I do intend to check out the other Hugo Nominations for best novel.  I've downloaded the 'free samples' for all of them. The Ancillary series has been on my watch list for awhile now.<br /><br />As to the Hugo's themselves, another suggestion to head off the slate-voting mess that this year's awards have suffered under could be making Worldcon voting more exclusive rather than more inclusive.  Limit membership and voting rights to those who are vetted through some sort of an application process that seeks qualifications in writing/critiquing/creating sci-fi literature.  <br /><br />That's my 2cents.  <br /><br />CONGRATS on the Locus nomination for Rogues!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 6 2015, 14:31:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"It&#39;s all in the wrist....","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://linnymay.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"linnymay","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"linnymay","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://linnymay.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"May 6 2015, 18:44:36 UTC","dname":"linnymay","ctime_ts":1430922678,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123371686/70873652","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21623581#t21623581","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21623581#t21623581","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21623581#t21623581","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2587046","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2246029","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21623581,"talkid":84467,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426269.html?thread=21623581#t21623581","above":21609501,"upictitle":"Frank Probst: pic#123371686","article":"The Gillian Flynn story was my \"gateway drug\" into Gone Girl.
