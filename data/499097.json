Hugo, Nebula, Oscar, or Emmy, it IS an honor just to be nominated.\r\n\r\n With these nine wins, GAME OF THRONES has now taken home more Emmy Awards <i><b>than any other drama in the entire history of television.</b></i>  That is a tribute to HBO, which truly has no rivals when it comes to production quality, and to David Benioff and Dan Weiss and the outrageously talented cast and crew they assembled to bring the Seven Kingdoms and their people to life.  I have been thrilled to be a part of this.\r\n\r\n And who knows?  There are more Emmys Awards this weekend, so we may not be done making television history quite yet.  Tune in on Sunday night to find out.","ditemid":499097,"eventtime":"2016-09-13 18:20:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"emmy awards, awards, television, hbo, game of thrones","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Sep 14 00:19:34 2016]R [Wed Sep 14 00:19:35 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/775851450240868352 ","current_moodid":15,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1474583164,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/775851450240868352","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.607409980373581]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1473812387}","revtime":1474583196},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-09-14 00:19:33","anum":153,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499097.html","event_timestamp":1473790800,"reply_count":68,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/50471337/164303","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499097.html?thread=24987289#t24987289","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499097.html?thread=24987289#t24987289","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499097.html?thread=24987289#t24987289","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"savatage","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://savatage.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24987289,"talkid":97606,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499097.html?thread=24987289#t24987289","upictitle":"ryan, diesel, ty johnson, dirk vargas, ect.. ect..: Syd","article":"All well deserved.
