I'm thinking this may be Mi√©ville's year.<br /><br />Pleased that <em>This is Me, Jack Vance!</em> is on best related, but it seems to me it's probably more a sentimental choice than anything -- Vance is a wonderful character, and I enjoyed reading the book for what it was, a narrativeless series of amusing or interesting vignettes more-or-less chronologically in order. It seems to me Vance and Clute are frontrunners at this stage, though, just based on name recognition and importance in the field (Mendelsohn is collecting a really extensive body of critical work, though, so who knows...)<br /><br />A whole lot of Dr. Who in the Dramatic Short category.

As pointed out by a  Hugo Award administrator, the vast majority of ballots submitted were online. (I heard only 4% were paper ballots). That would suggest that you're definitely seeing a shift, but whether sustainable or not, I don't know, as one data point doesn't make a trend, as yet. But I suspect so.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","below":9594034,"ctime":"April 6 2010, 12:11:44 UTC","parent":9585074,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Further Reflections on the Hugo Nominees","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://oldcharliebrown.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"oldcharliebrown","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"oldcharliebrown","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://oldcharliebrown.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"oldcharliebrown","ctime_ts":"1270555904","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/16406488/3544187","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145074.html?replyto=9594034","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145074.html?thread=9594034#t9594034","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145074.html?thread=9594034#t9594034","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145074.html?thread=9594034#t9594034","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"oldcharliebrown","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://oldcharliebrown.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9594034,"talkid":37476,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145074.html?thread=9594034#t9594034","above":9593778,"upictitle":"oldcharliebrown: pic#16406488","article":"Perhaps a shift . . . though the short form editor category is still dominated by the digest editors, and two professional anthologists.

My understanding is you read alot of science fiction and fantasy. I have seen alot of positive reviews of boneshaker. The guys at Elitist Book Reviews (some of Brandon sanderson's friends) did not like it. <br /><br />I have liked Robert Sawyer in the past. I liked Flash Forward (the TV show is VERY different from the book). <br /><br />You write in the genre and we like your writing, if you have a few minutes could you do a short blog on which stories you liked best (of the ones you read) or maybe your favorites for the past year? Would help me with my reading list. I like to read books that authors I like recommend. <br /><br />Here is one book tip from me. You said you like the Pillars of the Earth. Check out The Cathedral of the Sea. It is a translation from spanish, but very good. Takes place in Barcelona in the late middle ages. The authors does a VERY good job talking about the culture and politics of the city while being entertaining.
