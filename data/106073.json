{"itemid":414,"subject":"As Cersei Lannister...","event":"... yes, we have the superb British actress Lena Headey.\r\n\r\nThat's not news, I know.  The CHICAGO TRIBUNE broke the story, and the casting has been confirmed by the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, Reuters, and numerous other blogs and websites.  But just in case there were any doubts, this should put 'em to rest.\r\n\r\nLena is best known among genre fans for playing Sarah Connor in the recently cancelled Fox show THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES.  Sarah, of course, was played in the TERMINATOR films by Linda Hamilton, who was also Catherine on BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Yes, that was the \"Six Degrees\" clue, with Sarah Connor as the link. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006aw6c/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006aw6c/s320x240\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nLena also starred as Queen Gorgo of Sparta in the film 300, whence came my two \"Gorgo\" clues, one playing off the old monster movie GORGO (see below), the other off the actual historical Queen Gorgo, as chronicled by Herodotus, Father of History.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006cdsp/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006cdsp/s320x240\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n(Some folks have complained that the clues were too hard.  Maybe so.  Hard to judge these things.  Originally I had intended to write that the search for our queen had been terminated after looking at three hundred actresses, but Parris convinced me that you lot would have solved that one in about six seconds.  So blame her.)\r\n\r\nLena Headey has played all sorts of other roles besides Queen Gorgo and Sarah Connor, of course.  Check out her credits on IMDB.  She's even worked with Jennifer Ehle (our Catelyn) in POSSESSION, she played Guinevere in MERLIN, she's appeared in many period pieces and even a few set during the medieval period.  Her range was one of the things that impressed us most about her; Cersei is a character with many colors, and Lena will be able to give us all of them.  Her readings were wonderful... and of course she's beautiful and sexy as hell.\r\n\r\nYes, it's true, she's not a blonde, but she has played one on TV (and in films).  Seriously, guys.  This is HBO.  They know about wigs and hair dyes and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nLena should be amazing as the queen you love to hate.  I'm thrilled to have her aboard.","ditemid":106073,"eventtime":"2009-09-02 12:49:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"Spain","personifi_word_count":360,"taglist":"a game of thrones, hbo","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":41,"likes_first_notify":1,"commentalter":1350923130,"personifi_tags":"28:4,2:7,17:12,33:4,11:4,42:4,16:12,3:24,24:9,25:14,4:19,20:4,9:21,nterms:no","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-09-02 19:35:58","anum":89,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/106073.html","event_timestamp":1251895740,"reply_count":123,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/106073.html?replyto=7186009","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/106073.html?thread=7186009#t7186009","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/106073.html?thread=7186009#t7186009","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/106073.html?thread=7186009#t7186009","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"zmarlowe","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://zmarlowe.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7186009,"talkid":28070,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/106073.html?thread=7186009#t7186009","upictitle":"zmarlowe: pic#23050133","article":"Nice to see Headey get a chance to actually be on a _good_ TV genre show.
