{"itemid":2052,"subject":"Season 7 Is Coming","event":"Seven gods, seven kingdoms, seven books (eventually)... seven seasons.\r\n\r\nThe seventh season of GAME OF THRONES is on its way.   HBO has released their first teaser.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"886\"/>\r\n\r\nOh, and I almost forgot... HBO has also announced the premiere date: <span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">Sunday, JULY 16.</span>  \r\n\r\nThere will be gala premieres as usual, of course.  Not sure of the details on those yet.  But I do know that we hope to have another premiere party right here in Santa Fe, at the Jean Cocteau Cinema... and that we will be running a Season 6 marathon in the weeks running up to the new season, so you can refresh yourselves on what happened last year, and enjoy all the action on our <s>big </s>medium-sized screen.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of season 6, if you enjoyed the show and would like to nominate us for a Hugo Award, you have only eight days left.  Nominations close on March 18.  GAME OF THRONES is eligible in two categories.  You can nominate the season as whole in Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form (which is what I favor, personally), or you can nominate individual episodes in Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.   (Or you could do both, if you were so inclined).  If you are inclined to take the second course, the episodes most likely to make this year's (extremely competitive) ballot are \"The Door\" and \"Battle of the Bastards\" IMNSHO.  \"Battle of the Bastards\" won Emmy Awards for both writing and directing this year, and \"The Door\" was also a finalist for directing.\r\n\r\n((And though I am of course hopelessly prejudiced toward GOT, I will be the first to proclaim that this was an outstanding year for drama in both categories.  The first seasons of WESTWORLD and STRANGER THINGS are also worthy of being nominated for Long Form, along side last year's best SF movie, ARRIVAL.  In Short Form I loved \"Leviathan Wakes,\" the final episode of season one of THE EXPANSE, and two great episodes of BLACK MIRROR, \"San Junipero\" and \"Hated in the Nation.\"  I would love to see all of them earn spots on the ballot... along with GOT ))\r\n\r\nBut enough about last year.   A new season is coming.\r\n\r\nJuly 16.  Mark your calendars.","ditemid":525398,"eventtime":"2017-03-10 14:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, emmy awards, television, hbo, game of thrones","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Mar 10 21:36:37 2017]R [Fri Mar 10 21:36:37 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/840315481680707585 ","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1493318837,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/840315481680707585","picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.645689423041122]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1489181804}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2052?v=1489384544","revtime":1489384544},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-03-10 21:36:34","anum":86,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html","event_timestamp":1489156560,"reply_count":59,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125489637/76916672","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25830998#t25830998","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25830998#t25830998","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25830998#t25830998","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tcrawpaco","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tcrawpaco.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25830998,"talkid":100902,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25830998#t25830998","upictitle":"tcrawpaco: pic#125489637","article":"Have you given any thought to playing 1984 on April 4th?

The more and more I see these new shows coming out, Game of Thrones, Westworld, Stranger Things, The Expanse, Man in the High Castle, Mr. Robot, Black Sails Etc, I can't help but think that the television industry is beginning to surpass the film industry in storytelling capability from a visual narrative. I'll always love the movies, and I am absolutely astatic about Alien Covenant, Black Runner 2042, and War for the Planet of the Apes, but it does seem television is truly beginning to transform storytelling on the screen. I'm just curious what your thoughts might be on this particular topic?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 months ago","ctime":"March 10 2017, 22:48:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The future of visual storytelling ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://striker163.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"striker163","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"striker163","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://striker163.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"striker163","ctime_ts":1489186113,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/102582927/939768","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25834838#t25834838","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25834838#t25834838","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25834838#t25834838","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"el_regrs","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://el-regrs.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25834838,"talkid":100917,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25834838#t25834838","upictitle":"Belle: sexy ron","article":"*sigh*<br /><br />The waiting... the waaaiiiittttiiinnggg... lol","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 months ago","ctime":"March 10 2017, 23:12:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://el-regrs.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"el_regrs","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"el_regrs","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://el-regrs.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"el_regrs","ctime_ts":1489187541,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/127302985/81419233","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835094#t25835094","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835094#t25835094","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835094#t25835094","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835094#t25835094","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_4048774","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/KeltiaB","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25835094,"talkid":100918,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835094#t25835094","upictitle":"Keltia Breton: pic#127302985","article":"I read that Worldcon 75 will introduce a special Hugo category for \"Best Series.\" Will ASoIaF be eligible?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 months ago","ctime":"March 10 2017, 23:18:40 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hugo Awards","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/KeltiaB","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"KeltiaB","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4048774","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81419233&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"KeltiaB","ctime_ts":1489187920,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835606#t25835606","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835606#t25835606","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835606#t25835606","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835606#t25835606","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25835606,"talkid":100920,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/525398.html?thread=25835606#t25835606","above":25835094,"upictitle":"George R.R.
