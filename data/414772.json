Jets vs. Dallas! You've anticipated this game for months, listened to all the press conferences, got excited and you have great seats to the game. Somewhere around halftime the game gets delayed because of weather...<br /><br />But something funny happens during the delay - the scoreboard keeps updating with the future results of the game. Every touchdown, every penalty.<br /><br />By the time the delays are over and the 3rd quarter is under way, the scoreboard already has the final score of the game. Dallas wins 28 - 21. Now you can sit there and see how it gets to that score, but isn't your experience tainted? If you know all the major twists and turns in the game, how can you really enjoy it? Change months of anticipation in this scenario to 20 years for some and I think the disappointment is clear.<br /><br />Realize I'm derailing but there's never a good place to vent your frustrations about the shows passing the book and apparently no one working together to prevent it.<br /><br />This whole scenario will be remembered in a derogatory way.

That was arrogant fan fiction by guys who read the books ONCE and thought they could do better.  <br /><br />\"Licensed adaptation\" is just an euphemism for \"the fan fiction writers gave me dump trucks of money\".
