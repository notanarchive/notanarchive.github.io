{"itemid":1066,"subject":"Home Again","event":"Got back from my latest trip to Toronto yesterday afternoon.   \r\n\r\n(The avatar pic here is from my FIRST visit to Toronto, in 1973, for Torcon 2.  My second worldcon, and first trip ever outside the United States.  Yes, I was that young once.  Yes, there was a time before the beard.)\r\n\r\nA fun four days, albeit frantic.  The signing at Indigo Books drew a huge crowd, with a line that snaked out the store and way, way, down the block.  They told me afterwards that it was the biggest signing the store has ever hosted, breaking the record previously established by Bill Clinton.  Hey, cool!  That 1996 encounter with Clifford the Big Red Dog still rankles, but I outdrew the Big Dog Bill, so... \r\n\r\nIt really was great to meet so many of my Canadian readers, and I am sorry that our meetings were of necessity so very short.  That would not be my choice, by any means, but when the line is so long you need to keep it moving.  As it is, some people got there that morning before the shop opened, and were waiting all day... my hat's off to them, and also to those brave fen who drove all the way in from Montreal just to get my illegible scrawl.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone also managed to drop in on the GAME OF THRONES exhibit at TIFF Lightbox, and get your photo taken on the Iron Throne.  The exhibition was a hoot and a half, with one piece that... well, let us say, it startled even me.\r\n\r\nBesides the signing, and a couple of presentations at TIFF (one open to the general public, one for film and television students from the TIFF 'master class' program), HBO Canada and Random House Canada also set me up for lots and lots of interviews, so I've been popping up all over Canadian television and radio these past few days.  \r\n\r\nHere's one, for those who missed it: my guest shot on Canada's late night talk show TONIGHT, with George Stroumboulopolous.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"278\"/>  \r\n\r\nI will embed and/or link to some of the other interviews when and if they go up on the net.  Meanwhile, it's back to work for me.  As usual when I travel, I have lots of catching up to do.","ditemid":273022,"eventtime":"2012-03-15 10:48:00","props":{"current_location":"home again","taglist":"travels, signings, interviews","current_moodid":14,"commentalter":1332350477,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"torcon","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1332607466},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-03-15 16:57:18","anum":126,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html","event_timestamp":1331808480,"reply_count":61,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/107594035/9119118","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15663486#t15663486","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15663486#t15663486","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15663486#t15663486","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"snowpuss","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://snowpuss.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15663486,"talkid":61185,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15663486#t15663486","article":"I was in that line, god bless you and the Indigo staffers for keeping it moving so quickly!

They have hundreds of fabric choices, making the decision on what fabric to use the hardest part of having Xcentricites make us clothing. They often come to SF conventions, so check their website for their planned events. <br /><br />Wings made my wedding jewelry, including George's first turtle pin, which can be seen on several photos of George attending various GoT events in the last year. The turtle pins NOT exclusive to George, Wings made the turtle hat pin at my request, but the basic design is his and he has made it in many sizes and different presentations.<br /><br />Xcentricities made all or most of our outfits for our reception at Renovation last summer, not just for George and myself, but for our attendants and my Godskids as well. George's purple 'steampunk' vest was part of his reception outfit, and he wears it often. If you've seen his purple 'alien heads' vest in photos, that was also made by Xcentricities. Like I said, they have a incredible range of fabrics!<br /><br />Go enjoy their websites and see what other delights they have to offer, all made by people who put quality, craft and the desires of their clients above other considerations. They are good people with excellent skills and talents and we are delighted when we can promote their work to others.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 15 2012, 21:44:46 UTC","parent":15667070,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: LOOKING DAPPER!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1331847886,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15670142#t15670142","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15670142#t15670142","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15670142#t15670142","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"latissha","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://latissha.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15670142,"talkid":61211,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15670142#t15670142","above":15669118,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","parent":15669118,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: LOOKING DAPPER!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://latissha.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"latissha","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"latissha","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://latissha.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"latissha","ctime_ts":1331850588,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97353112/5010103","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667326#t15667326","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667326#t15667326","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667326#t15667326","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"misscato","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://misscato.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15667326,"talkid":61200,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667326#t15667326","upictitle":"Grand Cato of Catos: Golden Dragon","article":"&lt;3","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 15 2012, 20:26:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://misscato.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"misscato","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"misscato","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://misscato.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"misscato","ctime_ts":1331843201,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114441968/5889721","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667582#t15667582","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667582#t15667582","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667582#t15667582","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"phaedravelveta","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://phaedravelveta.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15667582,"talkid":61201,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/273022.html?thread=15667582#t15667582","upictitle":"phaedravelveta: pic#114441968","article":"I'm all up to date with the Fire & Ice series (get writing, get writing!), and then my husband bought me FEVRE DREAM for Valentines ..
