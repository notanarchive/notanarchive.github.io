{"itemid":394,"subject":"Plax to Prison","event":"So Plaxico Burress has agreed to a plea bargain, and will be going to prison for two years for sticking a loaded pistol in his sweatpants, taking it to a crowded nightclub, and shooting himself in the thigh.  He also lost something like $27 million when the Giants dropped him, and may have lost his NFL career as well.  He will be 34 when he gets out.\r\n\r\nI don't quarrel with the sentence.  Plax was incredibly stupid, and he broke the law.\r\n\r\nBut our justice system does seem seriously out of whack.  Plax gets two years for carrying a concealed weapon and accidentally shooting himself, Michael Vick gets two years for dog fighting, and Donte Stallworth gets thirty days for driving drunk and killing a man.\r\n\r\nIf I were king, I would have sent all three to jail, but Stallworth would have gotten the longest sentence, and Plax the lightest.  Yes, Plax might have killed someone too, if the gun had gone off in the nightclub and the bullet had gone someplace other than his leg.  But, ah, it didn't.  We don't usually sentence people on the basis of what might have happened.  Donte Stallworth actually DID kill another human being, no \"might have\" or \"could have\" involved.\r\n\r\nAnd on the same note, I think Ray Lewis should have gone to prison too.  Two people died that night, and I believe that Lewis knows who killed them, but won't say.\r\n\r\nBut there you go.  Sometimes I wish Justice would take off that blindfold.","ditemid":101102,"eventtime":"2009-08-20 13:23:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":257,"current_moodid":101,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1352694156,"personifi_tags":"17:11,18:11,11:3,30:7,37:3,23:3,16:11,3:19,19:11,39:15,9:30,13:34"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-08-20 19:33:50","anum":238,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html","event_timestamp":1250774580,"reply_count":52,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/38166420/1322587","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?replyto=6913774","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6913774#t6913774","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6913774#t6913774","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6913774#t6913774","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"doesi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://doesi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6913774,"talkid":27006,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6913774#t6913774","upictitle":"Ford &quot;Rommel-I-Read-Your-Book&quot; Pendleton: [EMOFACE SHOCKED]","article":"If I were king, I'd outlaw beets.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 20 2009, 19:35:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://doesi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"doesi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"doesi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://doesi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"doesi","ctime_ts":1250796958,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/18805963/4091018","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?replyto=6916590","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6916590#t6916590","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6916590#t6916590","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6916590#t6916590","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"misunderstruck","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://misunderstruck.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6916590,"talkid":27017,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6916590#t6916590","above":6913774,"upictitle":"Mr. X: axe","article":"If that happened, my wife would lead a revolution.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 20 2009, 20:06:14 UTC","parent":6913774,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://misunderstruck.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"misunderstruck","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"misunderstruck","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://misunderstruck.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"misunderstruck","ctime_ts":1250798774,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?replyto=6914542","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6914542#t6914542","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6914542#t6914542","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6914542#t6914542","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6914542#t6914542","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lno","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lno.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6914542,"talkid":27009,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6914542#t6914542","upictitle":"lno: pic#0","article":"If all of those crimes took place in the same jurisdiction you would have a stronger point. As it is, different locales weigh different crimes more heavily than others. For example- Plax didn't get 2 years for carrying a concealed weapon and accidentally shooting himself, he got 2 years for carrying an unlicensed weapon in New York. He could have had it openly strapped to his thigh. He could have intentionally shot himself, rather than accidentally. All of that is incidental to the fact that he ran afoul of the law prohibiting carrying an unlicensed gun in NY.<br /><br />In another state? He wouldn't face 3.5 years mandatory, pled down to 2.<br /><br />Donte Stallworth got 30 days, again due to many factors. He acknowledged responsibility, the family involved did not want to have a drawn-out fiasco, and so on. I agree that 30 days is light, but it is rather disingenuous to imply that it is the totality of his punishment.<br /><br />This is why I draw a distinction between, say, Stallworth and Vick. Stallworth made a mistake - a stupid mistake, a horrible mistake, a mistake that cost a man his life and he will have to life with forever. He deserves more than 30 days in jail, and he deserves the yearlong suspension from the NFL. The difference between him and Vick (which many people seem unable to understand) is not that dogs are more important than people, but that Vick did not take responsibility for his actions, denied culpability until all of his compatriots turned on him, and did not make a one-time mistake, but rather continued the criminal acts for <i>seven years</i>.<br /><br />I'm all over the place in this comment- and I'm sure some Eagles fan will come here and claim I'm not a real NFL fan. What I'm trying to get across is that the three players and their run-ins with the law cannot be compared equally, because they were in separate jurisdictions, which have different punishments for the same crimes, and some of them were the result of stupid, stupid mistakes and some of them were the result of deliberate, malicious, evil acts.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 20 2009, 19:53:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lno.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lno","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lno","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lno.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lno","ctime_ts":1250798007,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/35190326/3793816","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?replyto=6919406","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6919406#t6919406","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6919406#t6919406","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6919406#t6919406","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6919406#t6919406","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"illidanstr","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://illidanstr.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6919406,"talkid":27028,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6919406#t6919406","above":6914542,"upictitle":"illidanstr: Puma","article":"What you are describing looks more like reasons why \"justice will inevitably be unfair, and this is a good thing\" than any sort of reasoning for why this is fair (excepting that regarding Vick).

The two have zero similarities to each other, and should not be compared and contrasted.  Taken on their own merits, I think the sentencing in all of these cases is fair and justified.  Regarding the Stallworth accident - it was not his fault.  He was driving over the legal limit, but the DUI was not the cause of the accident.  The victim was illegally trying to run across a 6-lane highway.  The collision was not going to be avoided.  Stallworth was cooperative and remorseful.  It was a terrible accident, but it was an accident nonetheless, a one time thing that wasn't going to be avoided even if Stallworth's BAC was .000.<br /><br />Mike Vick was the leader of an interstate, ongoing criminal enterprise, who showed zero remorse and did not cooperate with authorities at all.  He exhibited a pattern of reprehensible behavior that would have been continuing on to this day had he not been caught.  People like to say, \"Stallworth killed a human, Vick only killed dogs.\"  Well, that's not what Vick was sentenced for.  It was for being head of a criminal gambling ring.  And, as a side thought, who's to say that a human life is inherently more valuable than an animal's?  We're all here trying to survive and make it to tomorrow. <br /><br />Stallworth = 1 time accident.  Vick = years of ongoing criminal activity.

Rightfully so, we punish the murderer the most...the involuntary manslaughterer the least...and the self-defender not at all. Stallworth was drinking that night...had a BAC of .126 and was speeding (50 in a 40). The person he hit was rushing to catch a bus after getting off of work and did not use a crosswalk, but ran through traffic. Stallworth saw him before he hit him...and even flashed his brights at him. Had Stallworth not been drinking that night...would he have still hit him? Maybe...maybe not. Was the drinking a contributing cause? Maybe...maybe not. Stallworth didn't flee the seen after the collision...called police...cooperated with authorities...and ultimately took responsibility for an accident that he may not have been the sole cause of. Was 25 days in jail...2 years of house arrest...8 years of supervised probation...an alcohol/drug evaluation & treatment....a lifetime drivers license revocation...and 1,000 hours of community service...an appropriate punishment for the situation? The prosecutor, the judge, the victim's family and the accused all thought so.  I guess I do as well.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 20 2009, 23:08:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I must disagree...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gradishar.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gradishar","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gradishar","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gradishar.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"gradishar","ctime_ts":1250809737,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?replyto=6941934","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6941934#t6941934","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6941934#t6941934","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6941934#t6941934","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rmdansak","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rmdansak.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6941934,"talkid":27116,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/101102.html?thread=6941934#t6941934","above":6924782,"upictitle":"rmdansak: pic#82652685","article":"Exactly.  <br /><br />This is the best summary of the facts I've read on this blog.
