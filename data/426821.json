Especially in terms of ASOIAF where I want to create the voices of the characters, and their internal monologues myself, rather than hearing an interpretation of them from another person.<br /><br />However, I would definitely listen to an audiobook if George did one himself, his reading of a Victarion chapter at TIFF was amazing to hear. Reminded me of the time in my childhood where I listened to Tolkien reading the rhyme that describes the Rings of Middle Earth. Magical.   <br /><br />I guess if someone likes to listen to an audiobook as they take a walk, or in the car, or if they're really busy that they can't find the time to properly sit down and open a physical book then it's great. The readers on Old Venus though are some of the most prolific I have ever seen for an audiobook. Might give it a purchase just so I can hear the good ol' Dame Diana Rigg read something.
