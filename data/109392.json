{"itemid":427,"subject":"As Sandor Clegane, the Hound...","event":"... yes, it's Rory McCann, a wonderful Scots actor.\r\n\r\nMost of you figured that out weeks ago, of course.  Mea culpa.  My clues were much too obvious this time around, especially the spelling of \"porage,\" which yielded up the secret to anyone who googled the word.  If I had gone with \"porridge,\" that might have created a few more hours of mystery at least.\r\n\r\nHere's the Scotts Porage Oats commercial from which the clue was taken:\r\n<lj-embed id=\"13\"/>\r\n\r\nAs for my second clue, \"the dog is green,\" well, that one was pretty easy to find as well, once you found McCann's name from the \"porage\" reference:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"14\"/>\r\n\r\nIt wasn't either of those that won Rory the role, however.  Nor was it his performance in HOT FUZZ, a movie that I've heard good things about but never seen.  His look had a lot to do with it, though.  A lot of good actors auditioned for the role, and several gave really first class readings... but simply did not have the physicality the part demands.  Sandor needs to be a big guy, powerful and threatening, someone who looks like he could break you in half.  Rory is all of that and more.  \r\n\r\nMostly, though, it was his readings.  We had other good ones, yes, but none to touch his.  One of the scenes in the side was Sandor's scene with Sansa, where he tells her how his face came to be scarred.  In the space of a few lines, Rory had me terrified (where he roars, \"Look at me,\" and makes her look at his face), made me chuckle (when he says no, the burns weren't dragonflame), and brought a tear to my eye (when he tells his story).  After I saw that, I knew he was Sandor... and David, Dan, and Tom all agreed.  \r\n\r\nI think you'll going to love him as the Hound.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we go to series, now we're going to have to find someone a foot and a half taller to play his brother.  Now THAT will be difficult!","ditemid":109392,"eventtime":"2009-09-23 16:36:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":348,"taglist":"a game of thrones, hbo","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":21,"commentalter":1323463777,"personifi_tags":"6:12,7:16,31:4,10:8,11:4,42:4,3:16,24:8,5:4,25:16,20:4,9:20,21:8,14:12,nterms:yes","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-09-23 22:57:13","anum":80,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html","event_timestamp":1253723760,"reply_count":94,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/107325393/1181688","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?replyto=7473232","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473232#t7473232","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473232#t7473232","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473232#t7473232","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nyghtowl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nyghtowl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7473232,"talkid":29192,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473232#t7473232","upictitle":"Paul NyghtOwl: redowl","article":"Yarp!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"September 23 2009, 23:02:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nyghtowl.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nyghtowl","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nyghtowl","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nyghtowl.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nyghtowl","ctime_ts":"1253746969","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/75372805/15749392","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?replyto=7473488","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473488#t7473488","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473488#t7473488","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473488#t7473488","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473488#t7473488","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mhanbai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mhanbai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7473488,"talkid":29193,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7473488#t7473488","upictitle":"mhanbai: pic#75372805","article":"He's bound to be great!<br /><br />Where/when can we see these readings?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"September 23 2009, 23:04:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mhanbai.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mhanbai","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mhanbai","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mhanbai.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mhanbai","ctime_ts":"1253747061","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?replyto=7474768","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7474768#t7474768","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7474768#t7474768","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7474768#t7474768","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7474768#t7474768","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7474768,"talkid":29198,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/109392.html?thread=7474768#t7474768","above":7473488,"upictitle":"George R.R.

He even looks a lot like Rory, they really could be brothers.<br /><br />He got wind of speculation about him because he mentioned on his blog he had read for a role in an American TV series - he didn't say what role at all, just that he'd done an audition.  Then he made a nice, long comment on the Winter is Coming blog about it cause people were emailing him and such.  Basically, he said if he got cast as either Drogo or Gregor he'd be very happy - less so, I think, if he was Hodor (which frankly, he's just wrong for, IMO).  He was very careful to not say what show he did an audition for, though.  He was being pretty careful about that.<br /><br />I hope the guy can act well, I like him from reading his page and his comment on WiC.  He's smart (a member of Mensa), and a total sci-fi/fantasy geek, admitting he plays D&D and has a whole host of other nerdy pursuits. (He's one of us!! One of us!! One of us!!).  In the end, though, it's what he can do performance-wise that really matters.<br /><br />About Rory, I'm very happy.  I've seen him in a few things and he's great (a great, showy and dramatically climactic scene in \"Alexander\" and as Atilla the Hun on TV).  His role in \"Hot Fuzz\" isn't much to go by, though I love the movie.
