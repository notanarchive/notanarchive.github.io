{"itemid":493,"subject":"Sunday, Sunday","event":"Playoff  football.  Nothing like it.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I loved the morning game.  I was rooting for the Ravens to win, but I won't pretend I ever expected anything like the whuppin' they put on the Patriots.  It's always nice to see Evil Little Bill get elimimated, so we can be treated to another one of his mumbling monotone press briefings, where he says nothing at all.  (Win or lose, I much prefer Rex, who shows signs of being an actual human being, with emotions and a sense of humor and everything).  It would have been a much closer game if Welker had not been injured, doubtless (I actually kind of like Welker, though he killed the Jets the last time we played the Pats.  It still baffles me why the Dolphins traded him to New England for a bag of old socks, just as it puzzles me why the Raiders would give Randy Moss to New England for one of EVil Bill's old sweatshirts.  Must be some sort of evil power) -- but the way the Ravens were playing, they would still have won.  Brady looked... dare one say it... mediocre.  \r\n\r\nThe afternoon game was... ah... exciting.  And unexpected.  I really expected the Pack to handle the Cardinals easily.  This is same stuff Arizona pulled last year : winning a sub-par division with such erratic and uninspired play that no one took them seriously, only to come alive suddenly in the post-season.  Anyway, Warner played an amazing game.  Rodgers was very good too, once he settled down, but those passing stats of Kurt's are mind-boggling.  I have to give the Packers credit for an amazing comeback.  They looked dead half a dozen times, but just kept kicking dirt off their faces and clawing back out of the grave.  And the ending had as much irony as it did drama.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great football entertainment, though somewhere in the distance I can hear the wails of weeping cheeseheads.  An all-time record for scoring in the post-season, I hear.  From my point of view, the wrong team won.  I guess the Pottsville Maroons will have to wait another week for their curse to kick in.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I have to take issue with the commentators who are called the Arizona/ Green Bay shootout a \"great game.\"  That it wasn't.  Exciting, yes.  Entertaining, definitely.  Good football?  No.  Neither team brought a defense.  Up and down the field, up and down, up and down, pitch and catch.  On the rare occasion where a defender actually defended against a pass, he'd get flagged for illegal contact or pass interference.  It was a basketball game, is what it was.  The sad result for decades of fiddling with rules to give the offense every advantage.  Myself, I think they've gone too far, and wish they'd go back, if not to the rules of 50s, at least to those of the 70s.  Let the cornerbacks defend, goddamn it.  \r\n\r\nThese rules changes make it almost impossible to compare players from different eras, at least by using stats.  The stats for modern players are grossly inflated.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the Cardinals go on, the Pack goes home, the Patriots are done... and now the Jets have to face the Chargers, while the Ravens get the Colts.  On paper, the Jets don't have much chance against San Diego, but as this weekend's games have proved, anything can happen.\r\n\r\nWhat would be really cool would be if the Jets and Ravens both won.  Long odds, I know... but if it happened, Giants Stadium would host one more NFL game before being demolished.  The AFC Championship.  And wouldn't THAT be cool?\r\n\r\nHey, a boy can dream.","ditemid":126225,"eventtime":"2010-01-11 00:08:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":628,"taglist":"nfl","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":106,"commentalter":1352583872,"interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"18:8,35:10,37:11,23:4,3:15,4:2,25:20,26:4,9:10,21:4,13:24,nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-01-11 07:08:05","anum":17,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html","event_timestamp":1263168480,"reply_count":46,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/80068694/1442560","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?replyto=8285713","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285713#t8285713","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285713#t8285713","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285713#t8285713","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"firerosearien","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://firerosearien.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8285713,"talkid":32366,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285713#t8285713","article":"And what is life without our dreams?","upictitle":"Firerose Arien: [info]open_the_blinds)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"7 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"January 11 2010, 07:42:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://firerosearien.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"firerosearien","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"firerosearien","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://firerosearien.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"firerosearien","ctime_ts":"1263195731","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/90547506/12553023","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?replyto=8285969","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285969#t8285969","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285969#t8285969","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285969#t8285969","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bbeitel","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bbeitel.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8285969,"talkid":32367,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126225.html?thread=8285969#t8285969","upictitle":"bbeitel: pic#90547506","article":"I agree with you about all the rules changes.

I was blown away by the game that Rodgers and Warner played. Aaron Rodgers is the third best quarterback in the game today (behind Rivers and Manning) and will probably have a few rings on his hand before his career is all said and done. And Warner, what else can be said about the guy, he does nothing but create franchises; first he brings us the greatest show on turf, now the hottest thing in the desert.

Scoring will be up because offensive game planning is just better than in the 1970s and defensive game planning and talent have not kept up. Plus offensive coordinators woke up in the mid-late 1980s and realized \"hey a quarterback who can avoid the rush is a good thing and we should not send Doug Flutie to Canada because he scrambles)\". So it is just harder to get pressure on the quarterback since he actually moves around in the pocket. Pre-1985 quarterbacks literally stood there like statues and were COACHED to not move. <br /><br />I don't like the rules now. It also puts too much emphasis on the Quarterback. This is a team game. This is not basketball where 1 guy should be able to change a franchise by himself and that 1 guy can only be a quarterback. Quarterbacks have always been the most important players on a team now it is too much. This is in large part due to the rule changes.<br /><br />That being said most fans like scoring and don't want to see a punt fest (see the complaints about the BCS championship) so it won't happen. Same thing with baseball. Fans generally would rather see a 12-11 game than  2-1 game with a nice hit and run in the middle of it.

I worry that this is where the NFL is heading - quarterbacks and wide recievers are essentially untouchable so teams are locked into dome-style shootouts. There'll be no pass rush, no running game aside from the occasional draw, and quarterbacks throwing it up 50/55 times a game. It's like baseball and the home run - it becomes dominant -and the game becomes tailored to it- because this is what \"the fans want.\" Urgh.
