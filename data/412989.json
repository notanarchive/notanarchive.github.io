You also said many times that you \"knew you were doomed when you draw the map\".<br />Can you give us a little insight on what happened between those two events? When did the Lannisters come into play, when Daenerys? Whats going on in a mind like yours after finishing that first chapter?<br />Being able to create this enormous world fascinates many people including me so I would really like to know some of the steps that took place between finishing that first chapter and drawing the map.<br />For example did you at some point just go like \"you know what? actually i think i need another story line\" and then create Stannis? Or was it all there from the start?

Right out of the gate, should I buy Old Venus?  I suppose I should have at least looked up its description prior to this question but I see it on your site so often; spur of the moment.  I'm getting into a science fiction kick and know you are quite the SyFy aficionado.  Maybe some suggestion of your favorites?  <br /><br />Hey, thanks for ASOIAF.  Adore it, bought and read anything related to it.  Dunk and Egg is dope, thrilled for the next additions.  I'm saving a vacation day for the 12:00 release of TWOW.<br /><br />Good luck!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"March 24 2015, 00:36:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Old Venus and the Science Fiction genre","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://groundpoultry.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"groundpoultry","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"groundpoultry","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://groundpoultry.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"groundpoultry","ctime_ts":1427157408,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412989.html?thread=20505149#t20505149","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412989.html?thread=20505149#t20505149","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412989.html?thread=20505149#t20505149","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"milkforfree","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://milkforfree.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20505149,"talkid":80098,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412989.html?thread=20505149#t20505149","upictitle":"milkforfree: pic#0","article":"In my experience as a legal writer, great writing is a product of hating everything you've written that isn't great.
