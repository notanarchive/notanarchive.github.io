Some Dunk and Egg mayhaps? I can do with whatever, just curious :)<br /><br />Anyways, another one of my pointless questions that you understandably won't answer: Aurane Waters, where did he come from? As in which ship did he serve on? Not Bold Laughter as it was blown to splinters by a trebuchet. Not Harridan as it was consumed by the Wildfire explosion. Presumably not the Pride of Driftmark as it allegedly burned with all on board, including Lord Monford (personally I don't believe that for a second). That leaves the Seahorse, which I assume ended up in amongst all the wrecked ships that formed the bridge, as Tyrion/Ser Mandon ran into Velaryon spearmen on said bridge of broken ships - why didn't they encounter Aurane? I doubt he would've headed in the opposite direction, towards Stannis, as he probably knew all too well what Stannis does with cowards, traitors, smugglers etc... so what gives? Where did he come from? Rosby??<br /><br />Hail the White Worm!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 month ago","ctime":"March 16 2017, 12:15:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://aegonvivelaryon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"aegonvivelaryon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"aegonvivelaryon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://aegonvivelaryon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"March 16 2017, 18:04:19 UTC","dname":"aegonvivelaryon","ctime_ts":1489666548,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/526901.html?thread=25867829#t25867829","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/526901.html?thread=25867829#t25867829","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/526901.html?thread=25867829#t25867829","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25867829,"talkid":101046,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/526901.html?thread=25867829#t25867829","above":25867061,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I was trying to poke at you a little, see if I could force a reaction of some kind at some point (came earlier than expected), maybe you'd even let something slip? Who knows? Alas, naught. Well played Ser. Still though, your non-answer was far more enlightening than anything I've found on fan sites or forums.. If I were to post the question about Aurane on a fan site I would be inundated with completely undocumented theories on why he's Crow's Eye or Daario Naharis incognito, trust me, I've tried. I can't place him during the battle and neither can any other fans. Some of these question I've pondered for a decade now, I had to try :( I'll go back to my basement and my tin foil now, maybe make a theta out of it rather than just hats..
