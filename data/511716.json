{"itemid":1998,"subject":"GAMES OF THRONES Competes For Golden Globe","event":"The Golden Globe nominations are out for 2016, and HBO's sixth season of GAME OF THRONES has made the shortlist once again.   GOT will be competing for the Globe for best drama with WESTWORLD, STRANGER THINGS, THIS IS US, and THE CROWN.\r\n\r\nMy congratulations to David Benioff, Dan Weiss, Bryan Cogman, and the rest of our amazing cast and crew... and especially to Lena Headey, who earned a Globe nomination of her own for Best Supporting Actress.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/405275/405275_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/405666/405666_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/405977/405977_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe full list of this year's nominees can be found here: http://variety.com/2016/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-2017-nominees-full-list-1201938375/\r\n\r\nBeing an HBO guy, I'm thrilled that to see that both GAME OF THRONES and WESTWORLD have been nominated for the big prize... though WESTWORLD is going to be some tough competition.  (In fact, I would figure WW for the favorite).   And as an science fiction and fantasy geek, I am also delighted to see that STRANGER THINGS made the list.  Three out of five finalists being genre shows... and during this golden age of television... is another sign of just how far we've come.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\r\n\r\nThe winners will be announced in LA on Sunday, January 8.","ditemid":511716,"eventtime":"2016-12-14 16:29:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"awards, television and film, hbo, game of thrones","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Dec 14 23:28:28 2016]R [Wed Dec 14 23:28:29 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/809178273628372993 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1481913258,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/809178273628372993","picture_keyword":"Emmy","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.624539532788531]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1481758159}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1998?v=1481926547","revtime":1481926544},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-14 23:28:27","anum":228,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511716.html","event_timestamp":1481732940,"reply_count":14,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126925994/79919867","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511716.html?thread=25413092#t25413092","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511716.html?thread=25413092#t25413092","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511716.html?thread=25413092#t25413092","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"danihinze","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25413092,"talkid":99269,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511716.html?thread=25413092#t25413092","upictitle":"Dani Hinze: pic#126925994","article":"I watched them all. <br />Game of thrones seasons 6 , wrapped a lot of plot lines up, and was on of the most exciting and BEST seasons of the game of thrones series. <br /><br />West world was good, but it was very slow, written well and the hidden agenda was done well, the last two episodes was a eye opener.<br /><br />Stranger things was amazing the best Netflix series yet. <br />However, not being bias but game of thrones season 6 should win hands down. <br /><br />I can't wait for the book :) but please take your time writing it.
