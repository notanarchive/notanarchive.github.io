Although there is a lot of fantasy/sci-fi that I enjoy and find aesthetically well done, I don't often come across a fantasy/sci-fi story (especially a more mainstream one) that regards and criticizes Humankind and its shortcomings in as raw or direct a manner as many of the dramas that end up winning those awards.  In fact, the purpose of most of the former seem to be to entertain readers and viewers (which is fine) as opposed to commenting on aspects of being human (whether social or otherwise), which I think makes them less memorable and timeless than stories that do (which, again, seem to be mostly dramas).<br /><br /><i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>/\"Game of Thrones,\" I think, does a much better job of addressing issues in society as well as Humankind's shortcomings than most fantasy/sci-fi stories.  The characters feel much more real (especially Tyrion and the Hound) and the situations and outcomes more desperate.  Many dislike the Red Wedding sequence, but it is one of my favorite scenes simply because it shows that, like in real life, <i>no one</i> is safe from others' greed and ambition--<i>no one</i> is safe from unwittingly becoming a pawn in others' games--<i>no one</i> is safe from being used as a means to an end.  <br /><br />Even if \"Game of Thrones\" doesn't win (<i>this</i> time ;D), I think a lot can be said for the ground that it's broken for fantasy/sci-fi stories.  If nothing else, it shows what the genre is capable of so that those stories are taken more seriously in the future.<br /><br />Anyway, sorry for the long comment.  ^^;  I'll be cheering for \"Game of Thrones\" and Peter (although I confess that I'll be cheering for Steve as well xD).
