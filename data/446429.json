{"itemid":1743,"subject":"What Movie?","event":"Don't believe everything you read, boys and girls.  Especially not on line.\r\n\r\nI don't know where this latest round of \"there's going to be a GAME OF THRONES movie\" nonsense is coming from, but suddenly it is everywhere, and all of us connected with the show and HBO are being bombarded.  But nothing has changed.\r\n\r\nLet me review, for those who came in late.\r\n\r\nThe idea of ending GAME OF THRONES with one or more major feature films was first floated oh, three or four years ago.  Let me say once again: this was <b><i><span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">NOT MY IDEA</span></i></b>.  However, I may have been the first one to mention the notion in public -- where and how I no longer recall -- so somehow I became associated with it.\r\n\r\nI did say that I liked the idea.  Of <i><b></b></i>course<b><i></i></b> I liked the idea.  HOw not?  This was back in the early days, where we couldn't even afford to shoot the Battle of the Green Fork and had to knock Tyrion unconscious instead.  When the king's hunting party consisted of four guys on foot walking through the woods.  At that time, in that context, the idea of big blockbuster movies with a LORD OF THE RINGS sized budget was powerfully attractive.\r\n\r\nAnd the idea is still powerfully attractive.  Not just to me, but to many people connected with the show.  Actors, directors, producers, writers.  How not?  It would be a great way to end.\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't mean it is going to happen.  There is great enthusiasm for the notion, sure, but not necessarily from HBO.  They are in the TV business, not the feature film business.  And those of you with long memories may recall all the rumors about a SOPRANOS movie... a ROME movie... a DEADWOOD movie.  Rumors is all they were.  And that's all this one is too, at least for now.\r\n\r\nLately the rumors have gotten even more specific.  The film will be about Robert's Rebellion.  It will be about Dunk & Egg.  It will... oh, it's all too silly.\r\n\r\nIt would still be cool, and I'd still love to see it... but nothing has changed since the last round of rumors.  I am still writing THE WINDS OF WINTER.  David & Dan are still filming season six.  HBO is still in the television business.\r\n\r\nDon't take any of this stuff seriously.  Clickbait journalism is to journalism as military music is to music.","ditemid":446429,"eventtime":"2015-09-28 18:44:00","props":{"current_mood":"annoyed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"the internet, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":3,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1443722484,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"What Movie? http://goo.gl/JMei2Z","picture_keyword":"hiya hiya hiya","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.677134303962321]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1443660362}","revtime":1443721488},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-10-01 00:44:01","anum":221,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html","event_timestamp":1443465840,"reply_count":53,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125454280/76870477","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737629#t22737629","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737629#t22737629","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737629#t22737629","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3324806","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/knightofsummer","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22737629,"talkid":88818,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737629#t22737629","upictitle":"A M: pic#125454280","article":"Do you think the Dunk & Egg novellas would work well as films?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 1 2015, 00:46:01 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/knightofsummer","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"knightofsummer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3324806","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76870477&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"knightofsummer","ctime_ts":1443660361,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737885#t22737885","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737885#t22737885","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737885#t22737885","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"unsentauron","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://unsentauron.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22737885,"talkid":88819,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/446429.html?thread=22737885#t22737885","upictitle":"unsentauron: pic#0","article":"Book, show, movie, graphic novel, whatever;

The thought of a movie sucks. Series began on TV, should end on TV. <br /><br />The only movie I would be open to would be a loyal cartoon adaptation using older animation technology (basically, no CGI). There are some pivotal scenes in the books that no live action TV show/movie could ever hope to emulate but would be absolutely amazing via cartoon. Case in point - the dialogue at the tower of joy. There is an amazing video floating around of the audiobook dialogue of the ToJ set against the Wiki of Ice and Fire illustrations. Not trying to be a kiss-ass but the dialogue at the ToJ is amazingly written and I just think voice actors would be better suited to nail the dialogue while animators focus on the vision of the scene instead of sacrificing vision to nail dialogue or vice versa using live action actors who have to accomplish both areas.

Others are just mild mannered adults ranging in the ages of 50-90 enjoying the onslaught of children and grand children's pictures. Other's still are forlorn, depressed and continuously write an incomplete poem entitled \"I'm hella bored. FML. What's going on tonight...?\"<br /><br />But..intermingling this society of sexy, tepid, and hella bored individuals lies a pandemic so ghastly, I can hardly mention it in public (let alone on respectable blog posts like this). It's too terrifying to mention with out breaking into a sweat, or the need to roll against your sanity points (A little Chaosium reference for the true schoo' gamers out there). These ghoulish fiends go around during all hours and post constant FIBS AND LIES!!! These aren't just normal human beings. They live in darkness, in subterranean compounds and caves. They blockade bridges and demand money or an answer to a riddle to cross said bridges. They turn to stone in sunlight. They are in fact (DUM DUM DUM). TROLLS<br /> And these Trolls don't post just  just any sort of fib or lie either. No, no, no. These fibs and lies have a certain appeal. Meant to invoke paranoia, or excitability, these fiendish fiendish trolls have only one goal in mind: TO CONTROL THE MINDS OF ALL THE INTERNET! For the feed of the negativity and power. <br />Who knows how these trollish fibs and lies are started. Perhaps it starts off as a hope, a wish, and desire of said Troll. Perhaps one of these trolls, lacking in sleep had a vision of a GoT movie so clear, so detailed it was like he was sitting in an iMax theater. This angered the troll when he woke from his vision. He wanted to spread his wrath from his disappointment, and make others suffer the same delusion. Hence...one night, he typed it all out.
