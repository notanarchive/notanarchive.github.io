{"itemid":1858,"subject":"Odds and Ends","event":"Got back from MystiCon on Monday.  It was a fun weekend, and did much to restore my spirits.  After all the internet rancor that has dominated on-line discussion of late, it was good to be reminded of what cons are all about... and how warm, welcoming, and open fandom can be.  The Roanoke crowd seemed like good folks.  And it was great to see how many young people and first-timers were at the con (I asked for a show of hands on several occasions).  All the alarums about the demise of traditional SF fandom may be somewhat premature, I'm thinking.\r\n\r\nBack home, of course, I had the usual thousand new emails waiting in my inbox.  But among them, at long long last, was my Hugo PIN from MidAmericon II.  I can finally begin nominating for this year's awards.  I urge all of you to do the same.  (And will have a few more Hugo thoughts and recommendations in subsequent posts).  \r\n\r\nWe had a great event at the JCC with Tony DiTerlizzi of THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES.  And one last week, before I left, with Joe Lansdale and HAP & LEONARD.  Plenty of signed books from Tony and Joe both are now available in the Cocteau bookstore.  If you're an autograph hunter, strike now while the supply lasts.\r\n\r\nWe have more fun events coming up in the next few months as well.  Magician Francis Menotti will be making a return appearance, with the trick that fooled Penn & Teller, and we have booksignings scheduled with Darynda Jones, Joe Hill, and Stephen Graham Jones.  And a little further out, Neil Gaiman will be appearing with some gigantic Tasmanian cave spiders.  Go to the JCC website and sign up for our email newsletter if you'd like more details on forthcoming events at the theatre.\r\n\r\nMeow Wolf's opening comes closer every day.  The gang down at Silva Lanes is working overtime right now, getting a little frantic as they labor to make sure everything is ready for opening weekend.  \r\n\r\nOh, and GAME OF THRONES season six is drawing nigh as well.  You may have heard.  Before the season six debut on April 24, the JCC will be running a season five marathon.  Weekly screenings, two hours per week, of the S5 episodes on our <s>big</s> medium-sized screen.  And admission is FREE.  First come, first seated.  \r\n\r\nI am sure there's more.  Life is busy.  Hope yours is too.","ditemid":475835,"eventtime":"2016-03-03 13:45:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, hugo awards, everyday life, fandom, signed books, hbo, game of thrones","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Mar  3 20:45:44 2016]R [Thu Mar  3 20:45:46 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/705494395424894976 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1457373461,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/705494395424894976","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.625660494808537]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1457037966}","revtime":1457557014},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-03-03 20:45:41","anum":187,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475835.html","event_timestamp":1457012700,"reply_count":47,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125868107/77454461","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475835.html?thread=24068539#t24068539","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475835.html?thread=24068539#t24068539","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475835.html?thread=24068539#t24068539","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3512515","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RPK_","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24068539,"talkid":94017,"etime_ts":"1457041186","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/475835.html?thread=24068539#t24068539","upictitle":"RPK: pic#125868107","article":"I liked your story about how one of your first jobs was selling time life books over the phone.
