{"itemid":188,"subject":"Posting from Portugal","event":"Lisbon is very hot, but very very cool.\r\n\r\nHaving a great time in Portugal.  The first event, last night, drew an overflow crowd.  My apologies to all those who had to stand, but thanks for staying.  The warmth and hospitality of my hosts and my Portuguese readers will be something I will long remember.\r\n\r\nWe have another  Lisbon signing this evening, and have added a fourth event, for Thursday, this one in Porto.","ditemid":48259,"eventtime":"2008-07-02 17:35:00","props":{"current_location":"Lisbon","personifi_word_count":73,"opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":83,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-07-02 16:43:08","anum":131,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/48259.html","event_timestamp":1215020100,"reply_count":0}
