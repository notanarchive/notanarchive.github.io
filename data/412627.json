{"itemid":1611,"subject":"At the Cocteau","event":"This will be a great weekend at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\nPETER S. BEAGLE and his travelling show return tonight, with THE LAST UNICORN.  \r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"552\"/>\r\n\r\nWe have one screening tonight (Friday) at 6:00, and two tomorrow at 2:00 pm and 7:00 pm.   Peter will be introducing each screening personally, and fielding your questions afterwards.  He'll also be on hand to sign copies of his original novel, and many of other classic works.  If you missed him last year when he passed through, don't make the same mistake again.  And if you were here last year, well, come again.\r\n\r\nIn between the two Saturday screenings of THE LAST UNICORN, we'll be showing THE SALVATION a new western in the classic tradition, starring Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"553\"/>\r\n\r\nCome Sunday, ELLEN DATLOW will be here with new anthology, THE DOLL COLLECTION.  \r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"554\"/>\r\n\r\nEllen will be joined by two of her authors, Jeffrey Ford and Stephen Graham Jones.  We'll have readings from the book, an interview, a question-and-answer, and of course Ellen, Jeff, and Stephen will all be available to sign their books.\r\n\r\nAll that... and our CREEPY DOLL CONTEST!  Check back here on Monday to see the winners.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/239922/239922_900.jpg\" alt=\"pic_1027\" title=\"pic_1027\">","ditemid":412627,"eventtime":"2015-03-13 12:46:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"appearances, jean cocteau, movies, anthologies, signings, signed books","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1426524869,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" At the Cocteau http://j.mp/1NTxadC","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.634133294553769]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1426272314}","revtime":1426524906},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-13 18:44:51","anum":211,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412627.html","event_timestamp":1426250760,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124706277/74679022","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412627.html?thread=20403667#t20403667","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412627.html?thread=20403667#t20403667","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412627.html?thread=20403667#t20403667","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3052785","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/gabicoiradas","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20403667,"talkid":79701,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412627.html?thread=20403667#t20403667","upictitle":"Gabi Coiradas: pic#124706277","article":"Hey, George!<br /><br />I don't even know how to talk to you, but i'll try.<br />I'm from Brazil and a huge fan of your work e all that blablabla stuff that you hear every single minute.<br /><br />I made a tattoo on my back, big.

Back then it was a non-issue for me so it never struck me as something that was standing out from the rest of the movie. It's still a non-issue, but now I am aware of much of the puritanism in society, and it makes me wonder if such elements would have been possible in an animated theatrical movie today (Disney's Pinocchio would probably never have been made the way it was back then).<br /><br />In books you can describe person with more beauty than it will ever be possible to find in the real world, and music and sound that can never be composed for a movie. At least not without failing to live up to the expectations. But I still like to hear what the sound of a spider crying sounds like as described in the novel:<br /><br />\"The magician crept as close to the unicorn's light as he dared, for beyond it moved hungry shadows, the shadows of the sounds that the harpy made as she destroyed the little there was to destroy of the Midnight Carnival.
