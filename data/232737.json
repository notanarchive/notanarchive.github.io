Odyssey was amazing.<br /><br />The problem I've seen with most college writing courses is how hostile the professors can be to genre fiction.  It largely seems if you write something other than the touchy-feely stuff you'd find promoted by Oprah, they want nothing to do with you.  Sometimes, the students are just as bad, though I've experienced that far more with MFA grad students than those in either the basic or advanced non-grad fiction classes.<br /><br />I once was called in to meet with an instructor because other students had complained I was \"attacking\" their work.  I critiqued their stories as I would a piece at Odyssey.  When I explained my background and why I was handling stories in such a manner (such as commenting that on page 14 of 16, something should have happened by now, and while the atmosphere was good, there was no tension), she responded that we shouldn't even be thinking of publication yet.
