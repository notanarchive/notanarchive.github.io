People are often really callous and self-absorbed (and somehow in our world those people never seem to lose their sword hand).  I've read a lot of what you've posted about some of the derisive and vicious remarks from your readers and just shaken my head, wondering how people can be so cruel.  <br /><br />Ultimately, though, I think they're just foolish and misguided, but it's done with a genuine love for what you give us in ASOIAF.  After all, no one gets terribly passionate when they're completely ambivalent about something.  Of course, that's easy for me to say from my perspective, when it's not me people are affronting.<br /><br />Anyway, I echo the sentiments that many other people have before me when I say that I'll continue to wait as long as it takes until Dance is finished, and continue to offer whatever lame support a total stranger can offer via a blog comment (or a \"not a blog\" comment, as it were).  Keep on keepin' on -- we'll all be here when you're done.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 27 2009, 04:18:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cailleanlarkin.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cailleanlarkin","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cailleanlarkin","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cailleanlarkin.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cailleanlarkin","ctime_ts":1235708335,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67685150/14072956","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76555.html?replyto=5548043","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76555.html?thread=5548043#t5548043","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76555.html?thread=5548043#t5548043","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76555.html?thread=5548043#t5548043","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jacobford","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jacobford.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5548043,"talkid":21672,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76555.html?thread=5548043#t5548043","upictitle":"jacobford: Default Jacob","article":"I was surprised, because I hadn't been paying attention and assumed April was the official date.
