I mean, the Feast was great without 2/3 of the best characters (Sorry Mr. Martin, it's true. Give me Tyrion any day of the week). You can't make a novel with such subtle intricacies as ASoFaI WITHOUT being an Artist (capital A).<br /><br />However, FTBG is HILARIOUS and RIDICULOUS for its own reasons, even set apart from the reason that they initiated the blog. The two brothers that do it have a following not because of their analysis, but because of their...ARTISTRY! (Not making a comparison to the same artistic ability that it takes to make ASoIaF!!)<br /><br />I just thought it would be awesome to see THE AUTHOR give a candid interview with two Critics, probably the most notable and vocal. Mr. Martin is OF THE PEOPLE, not Above the people, and he would give as much as he got. Ty would prep him :)<br /><br />By the way, I'll be in Ireland during the filming of the mini-series, when is Mr. Martin going to be there? Is it tacky to ask for an autograph at a pub?

I can't see there lawyers not bringing it up before anything was greenlit. I could be wrong, but I would find it hard to believe. There's a wealth of literature out there that awaits you, go explore. Or play xbox. Or play catch. Then, be pleasantly surprised when the release is announced.
