We are sitting around with Pat Murphy when we decide it would be a brilliant idea to rent a van, travel cross-country (critiquing on the way), and go beat up Clarion West. (Perfectly sensible, right?) Then Pat says, \"Wait, who's teaching this week? George? Have you seen him? He's pretty big. I don't know if I can take George. Let's rethink this.\"<br /><br />And so The Great Storming of Clarion West was called off because we all feared to face The Mountain That Writes.<br /><br />Have a great time, George!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 7 2010, 11:43:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bardofawen.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bardofawen","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bardofawen","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bardofawen.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bardofawen","ctime_ts":"1278503014","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10470899#t10470899","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10470899#t10470899","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10470899#t10470899","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_238697","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ext-238697.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10470899,"talkid":40901,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10470899#t10470899","upictitle":"hallucinationcity.blogspot.com: pic#0","article":"while dreaming of attending Clarion, I happened to stumble across an interesting wikipedia mention of ASOIAF... the band Blind Guardian (a long-running, successful German heavy metal band) have two songs on their upcoming album based on the series. \"war of the thrones\" based on the series as a whole, and \"a voice in the dark\", which focuses on Bran's story. i hope this doesn't count as \"fan-fiction\"; personally I see it more as a tribute, and a pretty neat one, at that.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Edge<wbr />_of_Time","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 7 2010, 17:44:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"a voice in the dark","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ext-238697.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/openid-profile.gif?v=5044?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ext_238697","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_238697","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=28852273&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"hallucinationcity.blogspot.com","ctime_ts":"1278524674","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10474995#t10474995","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10474995#t10474995","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10474995#t10474995","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cephalik","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cephalik.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10474995,"talkid":40917,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160755.html?thread=10474995#t10474995","above":10470899,"upictitle":"cephalik: pic#0","article":"You can find the songs on YouTube for those of you who care to look, A voice in the dark and War of the thrones.
