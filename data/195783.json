They seem to have their routines pretty much figured out. <br /><br />He doesn't seem to have the same kind of authority that a Pope has over the cardinals and bishops of the Church... or maybe he does, and we just haven't seen an occasion for it.<br /><br />We do know he's elected in secret deliberations of the Conclave, though. You'd think they'd only do that if his role was important in relation to themselves, in some fashion. Maybe they just want to select the best advocate for their own interests (continued support of the Citadel and the maesters, the prestige of advising the king, etc.)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"February 16 2011, 21:19:31 UTC","parent":12072647,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Grand Maester","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1297891171,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/80886337/16922966","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195783.html?thread=12083399#t12083399","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195783.html?thread=12083399#t12083399","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195783.html?thread=12083399#t12083399","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"serapheen","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://serapheen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12083399,"talkid":47200,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195783.html?thread=12083399#t12083399","upictitle":"serapheen: Fairy","article":"honestly that's how I always pictured a maester's chain too.

I love it when George posts the new greens before they go up on Dark Sword's site!<br /><br />OK, I'm just a wee a bit of a minis freak, so I can answer some of the questions that have come up:<br /><br />- Is there a plan how many of the main and minor protagonists will be available as miniatures?<br />If people keep buying them, it's good bet they'll keep cranking them out, but you don't need to be a minis freak to guess that...<br /><br />- Ice & Fire Lego?<br />Lego does make some castle sets.  If you're thinking about something more elaborate, some good non-Lego options might be <a href='http://www.hirstarts.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.hirstarts.com</a> (make your own blocks) or <a href='http://www.worldworksgames.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.worldworksgames.com</a> (pdf's to print on cardstock, cut, score, fold, glue, etc.)  Both great products for making castle models in scale with this type of minis. <br /><br />- Where can we find these miniatures? Does Dark Sword have a website? <br /><a href='http://www.darkswordminiatures.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.darkswordminiatures.com/<wbr /></a>   They tend to throw in \"free swag\" minis (not GRRM minis in my experience, but very nice) with your orders, which is a nice touch, and their customer service is excellent.<br /><br />- Will there be miniatures with the faces of the actors playing the characters in the HBO series, or are they all unique to the artist?<br />Not the actors; rather, the books and the imaginations of the sculptors.  Pretty sure they run stuff by George too, as their site occasionally mentions small changes they've made to some of the greens at his request before going to casting.  If you want them to look like the HBO actors, you're looking at a pretty advanced conversion project IMO; better get yourself some green stuff (see below) and start practicing your sculpting...<br /><br />- When he makes a Tyrion one I'll buy it and a bunch of others along with A Dance with Dragons when it comes out and have a release party with my friends.<br />Not only do they already have a Tyrion mini, but they have him in both 28mm scale (like the rest of the line, which generally means an *average* human is 28mm from base to eye level) as well as 54mm scale.  Same goes for the first Dany mini.  <br /><br />- Could someone tell me if there is a such thing as miniature painting classes?<br />Yup, at game conventions, usually.  Teaching these is how some of the top mini-painters in the world make a few extra bucks alongside their EBay sales and commission work.  You might also check any local shops that sell minis/games - often they have painting clubs that meet on weekends or whatever.  That's a great way to learn.  Or google \"painting miniatures\".  <a href='http://www.reapermini.com/forum/index.php?/forum/3-painting-tips-advice' rel='nofollow'>http://www.reapermini.com/forum/index.p<wbr />hp?/forum/3-painting-tips-advice</a> is one of the best online mini-painting resources I've ever come across (they are friendly with the folks at Dark Sword)<br /><br />- When I was a D&D geek (in the 80's) all the miniatures were pewter colored. Are these things made of something different now? Or is this some sort of master \"proof\" that's a different color from what is actually sold?<br />That is exactly what it is.  It's a 2-part epoxy putty that comes in blue and yellow parts that turn green and begin to cure when mixed.  It's been the industry standard for miniature prototypes for decades.  The same putty is also used by people who collect and paint minis - once you assemble a multi-part mini, there is a thin gap between, say, the shoulder and the arm that you've glued on.  Since the minis are so small, this is quite noticeable.  So you mix up a tiny bit of green stuff and stuff it into that gap, smooth it out, add a little texture to make it match the surrounding area (using toothpicks, dental tools, homemade tools, whatever) and once it's primed and painted, you can't tell it was ever more than one piece to begin with.  People also use it to create scenic bases for their minis to stand on, various items in their surroundings, or even to convert \"stock\" minis to create something new by adding or replacing parts (or perhaps making the Eddard mini look more like Sean Bean?).  There are newer mediums designed for sculpting but green stuff is still probably the most common, and the prototypes are usually called \"greens\" even when they're not.  Green, that is.<br /><br />Hope that helps...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"February 17 2011, 16:15:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1297959346,"tracked":0}]}
