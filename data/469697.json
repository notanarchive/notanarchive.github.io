{"itemid":1834,"subject":"Good Stuff to Read","event":"With Hugo nominations now open, the question arises... what to nominate?\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of good work done last year.\r\n\r\nA great place to start is with the LOCUS Recommended Reading List, which just came out:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.locusmag.com/News/2016/02/2015-locus-recommended-reading-list/\r\n\r\nI am sure there are some terrific stories and books that did not make the list (there usually are), but still, you can't do better when it comes to a starting place.\r\n\r\nAnd please note, in light of last year's controversies, that this is what a recommended reading list SHOULD look like.  Not a slate of five, with the message (spoken or unspoken) \"vote for these,\" but rather a long long list of quality work with the message, \"here's some good stuff, things we like, take a look.\"\r\n\r\n(I am, of course, gratified that so many stories from OLD VENUS made the list.  LOCUS has always been kind to me.  I point this out lest I be accused of bias.  So I cannot pretend to be a completely disinterested party, but I do want to be honest and upfront.  It should be said as well that, while I often share the enthusiasms of the LOCUS editorial staff and reviewers, and have found them to be on the whole a reliable guide, I do also disagree with their assessments from time to time.  We all have our own tastes).\r\n\r\nJust for the record, before the issue is raised, let me state loudly and definitively that I do <i><b><span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">not</span></b></i> want any of my work to be part of anyone's slate, this year or any year.  But I do feel, as I have said before, that a recommended reading list and a slate are two entirely different animals.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I will continue making my own recommendations here from time to time, when I have the time and the energy.  Both of which I find are in short supply these days.","ditemid":469697,"eventtime":"2016-02-01 13:46:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, locus awards, awards, science fiction","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Feb  1 20:45:28 2016]R [Mon Feb  1 20:45:31 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/694260310006300673 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1454705106,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/694260310006300673","picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.618789115067868]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1454362919}","revtime":1454362863},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-02-01 20:45:28","anum":193,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html","event_timestamp":1454334360,"reply_count":28,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125454292/76870492","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html?replyto=23936449","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html?thread=23936449#t23936449","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html?thread=23936449#t23936449","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html?thread=23936449#t23936449","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html?thread=23936449#t23936449","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3324812","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Teer1998","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23936449,"talkid":93501,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/469697.html?thread=23936449#t23936449","upictitle":"Cory Wetzel: pic#125454292","article":"Thank you for sharing this list.

You can start at the top of the list and scan down, looking for things that sound interesting. (We added a spoiler-free \"blurb\" for each story to help with this.) There's info on how to buy/borrow digital copies of the print magazines, there are galleries for fan and pro art, and there are tips for the best-editor (short form) category.

I appear to have anticipated it somewhat by reading several of the novels in the science fiction section already; so at least I have a minor head start.<br /><br /> I just finished AURORA by Kim Stanley Robinson and found it to be compelling and disturbing, at least from the viewpoint of someone who hopes we might one day go to the stars.  I'm glad to see it made the list from LOCUS, although I think the pacing of the novel was odd at times.  James S A Corey's excellent NEMESIS GAMES kept me awake for several nights because I couldn't stop turning pages.  I had the same experience with Carolyn Ives Gilman's DARK ORBIT and reading it reminded me somewhat of my first encounter with Andre Norton's novels many years ago, particularly the FORERUNNER books.  I look forward to finding and reading more of Gilman's work.<br /><br /> Next up in my novel reading queue are SEVENEVES by Neal Stephenson and then Ann Leckie's ANCILLARY MERCY.  After that I think just picking them randomly will do, although I might sneak in John Scalzi before resorting to random selection.<br /><br /> I don't know if I can manage them all before voting commences, but I will try.  When the nominations are final, I concentrate mostly on reading all of those titles on the list which I haven't yet read. I'm certain there will be many short stories and novellas nominated which I haven't encountered on my own, and probably some novels as well.
