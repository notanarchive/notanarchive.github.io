{"itemid":612,"subject":"Stuff and Nonsense","event":"Busy days.  \r\n\r\nThe reaction to the teaser that HBO ran before TRUE BLOOD has been amazing.  Of course, it's turned up all over the internet, and people are analyzing it frame by frame.  Makes me wonder what it would have been like in those dark days before Tivo and YouTube, when those fifteen seconds would have flashed by once, with no way to rerun 'em, let alone freeze frame.\r\n\r\nCasting continues apace.  Mycah, Janos Slynt, Gendry, Tobho Mott, Old Nan, Shagga, Syrio, Marillion, Doreah, Alliser Thorne, Grenn, Pyp, Rast, Osha... oh, why oh why did I invent so many blasted characters???  Didn't I know what it would cost?  Oh, wait... in a book, a cast of thousands and a cast of two costs the same.  For some roles, hard choices between lots of very qualified, talented actors.  For other roles, hard searches, where no one seems to be quite right.  Nina Gold is finding some great people, though.  And the search goes on.\r\n\r\nAnother monkey may soon be off my back.  All but two of the stories are in on DOWN THESE STRANGE STREETS, the latest crossgenre anthology I'm editing with Gardner Dozois.  We hope to be able to deliver that one by month's end.  A great lineup once again.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I've been wrestling with Kong.  For more than a week I've been pounding on the epilogue, but still can't get it to gel.  This morning I put that aside for a bit and went back to rewrite a Tyrion chapter, and that's going much better.  (Don't get too excited over me mentioning the epilogue, please.  I don't always write these chapters in the order you read them.  The epilogue will close the book, but it won't be the last chapter written.  For instance, the last chapter written on A STORM OF SWORDS was the Red Wedding).\r\n\r\nCome July, I'm off to San Diego to teach a week at Clarion.  There will be a signing at Mysterious Galaxy as well, I believe.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, the San Diego Comicon is looking less and less likely, so that will probably be the only visit I make to San Diego this year.  On the other hand, there's now a good chance I'll be at the NYC Comicon in October.  We shall see.\r\n\r\nI need more hours in the day, more days in the week, more weeks in the month.","ditemid":156885,"eventtime":"2010-06-16 12:34:00","props":{"taglist":"anthologies, dance with dragons, signings, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1277232096,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":410,"picture_keyword":"pic#97560826","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"18:14,6:2,31:2,33:7,37:2,32:7,3:41,25:7,19:4,4:26,26:7,20:17,9:9,13:2,14:2,nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1277493318},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-06-16 18:34:56","anum":213,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/156885.html","event_timestamp":1276691640,"reply_count":84,"comments":[{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"sf_writer","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sf-writer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10269653,"talkid":40115,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/156885.html?thread=10269653#t10269653","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sf-writer.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sf_writer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sf_writer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sf-writer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sf_writer","ctime_ts":1276714073,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119494582/581189","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/156885.html?thread=10271189#t10271189","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/156885.html?thread=10271189#t10271189","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/156885.html?thread=10271189#t10271189","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"errantly","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://errantly.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10271189,"talkid":40121,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/156885.html?thread=10271189#t10271189","above":10269653,"upictitle":"Jennifer: Bunnysuit","article":"Previous posts have contact information for audition tapes.

I just finished Dying of the Light. It is one of Mr. Martins earliest published works (correct me if Im wrong... but I think it was published in the 70's). <br /><br />It was a little difficult to get into, but it is a short read and you pass the event horizon soon enough and are left unable to put it down until done. I am so glad I decided to pick it up. It was unlike anything I have read before.<br /><br />Fevre Dream is also EXCELLENT. What a great story. Vampires the way vampires should be... damn you Twilight, damn you.<br /><br />Also edited and contributed to by GRRM are the Wild Cards books. Ive only read the three most recent but I can't wait to get my hands on the originals. So much fun.<br /><br />This post is getting longer than intended but Id like to write one piece of advise for my fellow avid sci-fi readers. After finishing AFFC (I read the books back to back about two years ago) I realized that I was in big trouble. It was going to be so difficult to read any other sci-fi after having been completely spoiled in ASOIAF. You HAVE to get over it!!! So what, there is alot of crappy sci-fi out there. We have all been reading it for years, and we must continue! Without the crappy sci-fi how can we ever appreciate the good... and the rare masterpiece. So put ASOIAF out of your mind when picking up the odd run-of-the-mill epic fantasy or space opera... it wont compare but that doesnt mean we can't enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />Rant over.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"June 17 2010, 12:29:52 UTC","parent":10276565,"massactions":0,"subject":"need

Have you read \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\"? It's an excellent book. I mention it because you do seem to strive for \"quality\" in you work. I have not read anything quite like this ASOIAF series and I am grateful for the opportunity to anticipate both the book and the series. Thanks for the updates! Rock on!
