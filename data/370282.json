I took your advice and tried the eggs benedict con queso with jalapeño turkey sausage at Guadalupe. Oh, man. I want to fill my backpack full of the stuff. I'll try to catch Godzilla on Sunday. No better way to spend Mothers Day than with a mighty radioactive beast.

They had to re-edit their montage because they ran the promo between six and 7:30, and parents were writing in and calling because their little kids were screaming and nightmaring as a result.<br /> <br />I was of the same age, but it wasn't <i>Godzilla</i> which had me scared;  I saw the full American cut with Raymond Burr more than once.  It was <b>other</b> monster movies which scared the bejesus out of me.
