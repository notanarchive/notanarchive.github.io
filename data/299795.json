{"itemid":1171,"subject":"Sending things to our office","event":"George has, in the past, been happy to sign books or memorabilia for fans who were willing to ship them to him.  Unfortunately, in recent months, primarily due to the success of the HBO show, the volume of incoming items has gotten too high.  This is primarily due to resellers who want to get George's signature on things they then sell on eBay or through other channels.\r\n\r\nTo put a stop to this so that it doesn't take up so much time, I'm implementing the following policy for signatures:\r\n\r\n* Any package sent to this office that has not been pre-arranged with our office administrator at grrmbooks@gmail.com will be refused and returned unopened.\r\n\r\n* Items unrelated to George's work will not be signed (yes, I'm talking to you guy who sent us a giant box of baseballs to be signed)\r\n\r\n* All signature requests must include the name of the person for whom the item is being signed, and will be personalized at George's discretion.  No sending us 20 books \"just signatures please\"\r\n\r\n* If you are a book dealer looking for signatures for your store, contact the office administrator at the above email address and we'll see if we can help you.\r\n\r\nIf you're a legitimate fan that wants a book signed, please contact us and we'll help you arrange that.  If you want George to sign a hundred book plates so you can sell them on eBay for grossly inflated prices, sorry, you're out of luck.","ditemid":299795,"eventtime":"2012-11-27 11:33:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"ty","current_moodid":5,"commentalter":1354485078,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":4,"interface":"web","opt_lockcomments":1,"revtime":1354829689},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-11-19 18:33:28","anum":19,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299795.html","event_timestamp":1354015980,"reply_count":42,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91926989/1845595","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299795.html?thread=16864275#t16864275","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299795.html?thread=16864275#t16864275","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299795.html?thread=16864275#t16864275","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"gianetta","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gianetta.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16864275,"talkid":65876,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299795.html?thread=16864275#t16864275","upictitle":"gianetta: pic#91926989","article":"It's really nice of him to do that for fans, but I have a hard time believing real fans would want him spending time doing that sort of thing for them when he could be writing.

Right after \"Clash\" came out George was selling copies of \"Game\" from his site.  I already owned a copy of the 1st edition, but wanted a signed copy so I ordered one from him.  As my check was in the mail the price increased quite a bit due to the demand (and this is well before HBO was in the picture).  Not only did George honor my original charge, but he traded me my original 1st edition \"Game\" for a 1st edition \"Clash\" which he had (I couldn't find one myself).  He also agreed to sign several of my other books of his.  Not wanting to bother him, but also not wanting to miss the chance, I packed the rest of the box with all the other stories of his I owned in various \"Analog'\" and Asimov's Science Fiction\" magazines.  I expected him to only sign the hardcovers and ship the box back to me (postage was prepaid by me).  He was gracious enough to go through the box and sign and inscribe everything I put in there.  Being a huge fan, I can't tell you how psyched I was to receive this box back.  I couldn't believe he would take the time and energy to do this for a fan.  I would never sell ANY of these mementos.  I still can't believe my luck with this, but even more so, I can't believe he is still willing to do this for his fans after all the success he has achieved since that day many years ago.  George R.R. Martin is one class act!  He is not only a phenomenal author, but he has to be the most down-to-earth and generous famous person ever!!!
