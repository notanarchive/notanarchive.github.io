Thanks to everyone who attended, to the good folks at Page One for hosting the event, and to Craig Chrissinger for acting as MC.\r\n\r\nThose of you who weren't able to attend can still pick up a hardcover first edition of BUSTED FLUSH signed by Melinda (Double Helix) Snodgrass, John Jos. (Carnifex) Miller, Carrie (Curveball) Vaughn, Caroline (Amazing Bubbles) Spector, Bud (Little Fat Boy) Simons, Ian (Genetrix) Tregillis, Victor (the Radical) Milan, and yours (the Great and Powerful Editor) truly by visiting Page One's website at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.page1book.com/\r\n\r\nWe signed a goodly stack of books, but the supply won't last forever, so it's first come, first served for the autographed copies.\r\n\r\nAnd Page One will also be delighted to sell you autographed copies of Carrie's latest Kitty book, Daniel Abraham's AN AUTUMN WAR, Melinda's EDGE OF REASON, the Green Ronin WILD CARDS rpg by John, HUNTER'S RUN signed by me and Daniel (but not Gardner), and John Maddox Robert's latest SPQR mystery.\r\n\r\nAfter the signing we all went off to Powdrell's, ate us some barbeque, and talked about the Wild Cards books to come.","ditemid":78582,"eventtime":"2009-03-08 16:48:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":225,"taglist":"wild cards","opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1237230405,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","verticals_list":"books"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-03-08 22:52:02","anum":246,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html","event_timestamp":1236530880,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122839423/4390963","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?replyto=5627638","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5627638#t5627638","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5627638#t5627638","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5627638#t5627638","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"parsleigh","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://parsleigh.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5627638,"talkid":21982,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5627638#t5627638","upictitle":"parsleigh: pic#122839423","article":"Sometime Steve and have to get to NM again.

I read that Walter Jon Williams had his car totalled in an accident while he was driving to the signing, but glad to see he's okay. <br /><br />Out of curiousity, have you seen the <em>Watchmen</em> film? I'd be interested in your thoughts on it. Victor Milán's <a href=\"http://victormilan.com/blog/2009/03/05/why-watch-watchmen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">post about it</a> reminded me of the fact that <em>Wild Cards</em> was up for a Hugo against the original comic.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"March 10 2009, 18:12:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1236708723,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?replyto=5633526","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5633526#t5633526","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5633526#t5633526","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5633526#t5633526","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"az_cards_fan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://az-cards-fan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5633526,"talkid":22005,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78582.html?thread=5633526#t5633526","upictitle":"az_cards_fan: pic#0","article":"Mr. Martin,<br /><br />I came late to the party as far as the latest \"A Dance With Dragons\" discussion.  As a former angry reader who has had a change of heart, here is my take.<br /><br />When you appeared on the scene with \"A Game of Thrones,\" I personally felt that I was reading something that, while loosely derived from historical occurrences, was unlike anything I had read before.  I am sure I speak for many readers when I say that I was excited for fantasy in a way that had been missing in previous years.  When your other books appeared, the excitement mounted.  When \"A Feast For Crows\" came out, I will admit that the level of tension raised by the book was good, though not on a par with previous installments, probably because most of my favorite POVs are reserved for the Dance.  In short (too late for that, I guess), we readers are anticipating much from the Dance and are naturally excited to see it emerge.  As time has passed and there was still no Dance, I began to have those angry thoughts, wondering why you didn't set aside your \"little side projects\" and focus on this book.  I would like to tell you about a bolt from the blue, some stunning revelation that changed my mind, but truthfully, it just happened.  I was perusing your website, disappointed at the lack of an \"I'm finished!\" message, when I thought, \"Why is he not entitled to a life just because I love his books?  When did he become a slave to my whims?\"  Answer: you didn't.  You aren't.  We are all making this bigger than it should be (I blame the media).  Even if you never wrote another word, I love the stories that you have given us (ok, I paid for them, but still).  I will eagerly devour Dance when it appears, but in the meantime, please do not be dragged down by the naysayers.  Being in sales, I know how a bad vibe can hurt performance of one's job, and I imagine you face that challenge as well.  This is one reader who realizes that your life is your own, and that when you are able to bring us back into the story, you will.<br /><br />Peace and prosperity to you, and let no one tell you differently.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Troy A.
