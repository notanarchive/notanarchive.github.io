I work at <a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com\" target=\"_blank\">George&#39;s cinema in Santa Fe</a>&mdash;what a lucky ogre I am!\r\n\r\nBeginning this Friday, Jean Cocteau Cinema will proudly screen <a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/film/mermaid/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Mermaid</i></a> (<i>Mei Ren Yu</i>), the latest film by Stephen Chow. Chow is the Chinese filmmaker (and talented martial artist) responsible for <a href=\"http://www.miramax.com/movie/shaolin-soccer/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Shaolin Soccer</i></a> (2001) and <a href=\"http://www.sonyclassics.com/kungfuhustle/splash/stephen/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Kung Fu Hustle</i></a> (2004). Chow brilliantly parodies <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dXBYVP7iw\" target=\"_blank\">absurd action and kung fu movie tropes</a>, and he is well known for his over-the-top martial arts sequences, bizarre circumstantial comedy, and quirky characters.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/356729/356729_300.jpg\" title=\"\" />\r\nWho doesn&rsquo;t love the surly chain-smoking landlady from <i>Kung Fu Hustle</i>?</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/357067/357067_300.jpg\" title=\"\" />\r\nAnd who won&#39;t love the half-octopus mer-uncle sushi chef in <i>The Mermaid</i>?\r\n\r\nDavid Ehrlich from <i>Slate</i> says of Chow&#39;s latest film, &ldquo;...it&#39;s demented. Great. And a hit.&quot; He also adds that, &quot;&hellip;Chow, without overlooking his hometown crowd, directs with a primal wit that appeals to all audiences with the immediacy of silent cinema.&rdquo; Read his full review <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/02/stephen_chow_s_the_mermaid_reviewed.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/film/mermaid/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>MORE ABOUT THE FILM:</b></a>\r\n\r\nXuan&#39;s estate project involving reclamation of the sea threatens the livelihood of the mermaids who rely on the sea to survive. A mermaid named Shan is dispatched to assassinate Xuan, but this inevitably leads to a complicated, interspecies, office romance. Out of his love for Shan, Xuan plans to stop the reclamation. Unfortunately, Shan and the other mermaids are hunted by a hidden organisatio, and Xuan has to save Shan before it&#39;s too late.</p><lj-embed id=\"728\"/>\r\n\r\nSee you at the Cocteau!\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#fa0202;\"><b>&ndash;THIS MESSAGE WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE MINIONS AT FEVRE RIVER&mdash;</b></span>","ditemid":485974,"eventtime":"2016-05-04 17:02:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","taglist":"shaolin soccer, jean cocteau cinema, stephen chow, the mermaid, kung fu hustle, mei ren yu","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed May  4 23:02:35 2016]R [Wed May  4 23:02:36 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/727996881662414848 ","current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1462660957,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/727996881662414848","picture_keyword":"pic#125379682","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.610165747118624]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1462403005}","revtime":1463425466},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-05-04 23:02:34","anum":86,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/485974.html","event_timestamp":1462381320,"reply_count":5,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/46166044/527073","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/485974.html?thread=24395862#t24395862","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/485974.html?thread=24395862#t24395862","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/485974.html?thread=24395862#t24395862","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"disgruntledgrrl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://disgruntledgrrl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24395862,"talkid":95296,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/485974.html?thread=24395862#t24395862","article":"It's a hilarious Japanese comedy about a noodle shop that is very reminiscent of Monty Python's \"And now for something completely different\".
