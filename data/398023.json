{"itemid":1554,"subject":"Twists and Turns","event":"Sony&#39;s stance on THE INTERVIEW seems to take a new twist every day.\r\n\r\nNow we are told that, yes, they<b><i> are</i></b> going to release the film.&nbsp; They are just not sure how.\r\n\r\nOf course, this all depends on who you believe.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK POST says they plan to release it on Crackle, their own streaming internet service:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://nypost.com/2014/12/21/sony-plans-to-release-the-interview-on-crackle-for-free/\r\n\r\nOther sources say the POST is wrong:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.slashfilm.com/interview-on-crackle/\r\n\r\nBit Torrent says that it is willing to show the film:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/21/bittorrent-tells-sony-its-happy-to-release-the-interview/\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know about any of this.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know is that Sony&#39;s statement that it &quot;had no choice&quot; but to cancel the film&#39;s release is plainly false.&nbsp; It had plenty of choices, and still does.\r\n\r\nThe best of those choices, I believe, is to open THE INTERVIEW in theatres on Christmas Day, as originally planned.&nbsp; I have been in communication with the owners and operators of other independent cinemas and arthouses, and representatives of some of the smaller chains, and I know that hundreds of these venues would gladly screen this film, if only Sony will make it available.&nbsp; Regal and AMC and the megaplexes may have caved, but the independents have not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sony could have the film on five hundred screens by Christmas, if it wants to.&nbsp; And I would love for the Jean Cocteau to be one of them.","ditemid":398023,"eventtime":"2014-12-22 00:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, movies, politics, censorship, movie theatre","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1419379195,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Twists and Turns http://j.mp/1xavJBR","picture_keyword":"hiya hiya hiya","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.683256463512192]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1419235154}","revtime":1419360010},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-12-22 07:58:43","anum":199,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html","event_timestamp":1419209940,"reply_count":27,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/102038094/306468","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19963335#t19963335","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19963335#t19963335","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19963335#t19963335","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mofette","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mofette.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19963335,"talkid":77981,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19963335#t19963335","upictitle":"[Mofette]: New Fringe","article":"Hopefully Anonymous come through on their threat.<br /><br /><a href='http://uproxx.com/movies/2014/12/anonymous-north-korea-plan-release-the-interview/' rel='nofollow'>http://uproxx.com/movies/2014/12/anonym<wbr />ous-north-korea-plan-release-the-intervi<wbr />ew/</a>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 22 2014, 08:13:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mofette.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mofette","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mofette","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mofette.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mofette","ctime_ts":1419235997,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/66837546/615482","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19964359#t19964359","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19964359#t19964359","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19964359#t19964359","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tsgeisel","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19964359,"talkid":77985,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19964359#t19964359","upictitle":"David: Arseholes","article":"Paramount is still suspiciously silent and suspiciously not being called out.<br /><br />Frankly, theirs is the bigger cowardice.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 22 2014, 09:44:56 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tsgeisel","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tsgeisel","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"tsgeisel","ctime_ts":1419241496,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19965127#t19965127","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19965127#t19965127","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19965127#t19965127","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sirdanforth","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sirdanforth.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19965127,"talkid":77988,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19965127#t19965127","upictitle":"sirdanforth: pic#0","article":"There's a joke about Sam being the CEO of Sony in there somewhere.

But we are living in the new America where the Constitution is consistently trashed and our government routinely tries to pass laws that get around every right.<br /><br />We have professors that teach their students that the constitution is an outdated document that needs to be changed.<br /><br />Austin Texas has free speech zones for crying out loud. My point is that we are witnessing the decline of the U.S. Cowardice reigns supreme so it shouldn't have come as a surprise to see Sony and the theatres completely cave.<br /><br />Our police departments are becoming militarized and taught that constitutionalists are the enemy. Excuse me, we should ALL be constitutionalists, defending liberty and dying for it if we must.<br /><br />The average U.S. citizen is taught to cower in fear when faced with an attacker rather than fighting. The ownership of guns is frowned upon now.<br /><br />People can't even defend themselves in their own home without the state prosecutors doing everything they can to get you on at least manslaughter.<br /><br />To an older gentleman like yourself, it should have been obvious that the theatres choose freedom of expression over fear, but that America doesn't exist anymore.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 22 2014, 18:06:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/117845557623655916903","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"iam noone","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2845263","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72767226&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 22 2014, 18:10:31 UTC","dname":"iam noone","ctime_ts":1419271593,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/15848837/1530444","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970247#t19970247","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970247#t19970247","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970247#t19970247","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970247#t19970247","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bastun_ie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19970247,"talkid":78008,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970247#t19970247","above":19967687,"upictitle":"bastun: Gaming Smeagol","article":"\"People can't even defend themselves in their own home without the state prosecutors doing everything they can to get you on at least manslaughter.\"<br /><br />Alternatively: a guy can kill an unarmed youth with a gun, on the street, and <b>not</b> be prosecuted.  <br /><br />Your gun laws, that permit private citizens, crazies, racists, and militias to own automatic weapons and assault rifles, are plain crazy.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 22 2014, 23:47:01 UTC","parent":19967687,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bastun_ie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bastun_ie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bastun_ie","ctime_ts":1419292021,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970503#t19970503","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970503#t19970503","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970503#t19970503","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970503#t19970503","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19970503,"talkid":78009,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398023.html?thread=19970503#t19970503","above":19970247,"upictitle":"George R.R.
