People view him as a possession WR but he actually has the speed to burn most corners with impressive deep ball skills.  As the Jets <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a> of course his stats will go down as he will play Revis Twice, Brent Grimes on Miami twice, and the Bills have a decent secondary as well.  I buy into his talent for sure though.  They still need another WR and a TE though.  Maybe this is the year the Jets don't use their pick on the D-Line like they always do?  Rex has had enough support from this front office, time to invest in the offense.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"March 23 2014, 21:10:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hide your pet, Vick&#39;s a Jet","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/anthonyademarco","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Anthony DeMarco","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1539183","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=55986064&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Anthony DeMarco","ctime_ts":1395609049,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123025799/69650678","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18823833#t18823833","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18823833#t18823833","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18823833#t18823833","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2500571","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.haynie","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18823833,"talkid":73530,"etime_ts":"1395611418","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18823833#t18823833","upictitle":"Jeffrey Haynie: pic#123025799","article":"George - At least you're not here in Texas in Dallas Cowboy fan purgatory....<br /><br /><br />P.S. - Becky says Hi!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"March 23 2014, 21:48:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Football","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.haynie","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jeffrey Haynie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2500571","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69650678&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"March 23 2014, 21:50:18 UTC","dname":"Jeffrey Haynie","ctime_ts":1395611299,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/118794306/52422829","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824345#t18824345","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824345#t18824345","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824345#t18824345","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1399228","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/r3g0rzz","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18824345,"talkid":73532,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824345#t18824345","upictitle":"r-dogg: pic#118794306","article":"There is one simple reason why the Jets got rid of Sanchez: \"Butt-Fumble\"","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"March 24 2014, 00:56:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Sanchez","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/r3g0rzz","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"r3g0rzz","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1399228","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=52422829&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"r3g0rzz","ctime_ts":1395622605,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123026527/69652952","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824601#t18824601","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824601#t18824601","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824601#t18824601","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2500713","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/matt.barrett.37","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18824601,"talkid":73533,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/361369.html?thread=18824601#t18824601","upictitle":"Matt Barrett: pic#123026527","article":"The defense and running game were mainly responsible for getting the Jets to back-to-back AFC title games.
