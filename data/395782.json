NFL players hit much harder & cause far more severe and permanent damage. So, in that regard, your idea might be better... seeing as the \"armor\" is a great contributor to the greater violence of the sport.<br /><br />Rugby & footy players appear to hit hard and they definitely cause superficial damage more often than NFL players, but because they are aware of their mortality outside of the \"armor,\" their actual impacts are minor compared to every play in the NFL. Granted, rugby & footy players have a much higher rate of spinal injuries. This is likely because American football players, from an early age, are taught to not use their heads like a spear. It still happens, but not as often as in rugby.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 15 2014, 13:58:15 UTC","parent":19869702,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Rugby","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"GeekFurious","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2058420","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=65344279&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"GeekFurious","ctime_ts":1418651895,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19878662#t19878662","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19878662#t19878662","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19878662#t19878662","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2922508","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/vince_jt","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19878662,"talkid":77651,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19878662#t19878662","above":19875846,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","parent":19875846,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Rugby","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/vince_jt","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"vince_jt","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2922508","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73560870&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"vince_jt","ctime_ts":1418692336,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124357707/73561036","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19870214#t19870214","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19870214#t19870214","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19870214#t19870214","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2922530","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/mmmmmmmmhm","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19870214,"talkid":77618,"etime_ts":"1418612365","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19870214#t19870214","upictitle":"Eliot Austin: pic#124357707","article":"better fired than stabbed to death by a circle of their peers","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 15 2014, 02:59:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/mmmmmmmmhm","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Eliot Austin","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2922530","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73561036&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 15 2014, 02:59:25 UTC","dname":"Eliot Austin","ctime_ts":1418612345,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/112794022/41139680","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19874310#t19874310","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19874310#t19874310","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19874310#t19874310","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_772912","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/KrystalStar","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19874310,"talkid":77634,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395782.html?thread=19874310#t19874310","above":19870214,"upictitle":"Krystal Crouch: pic#112794022","article":"Bah hahaha!
