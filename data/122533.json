I think I was probably too young to really get what DARK STAR was about, although I remember that the beach ball thing with claws was both scary and pretty ridiculous-looking.<br /><br />I wasn't allowed to watch ALIEN until many years later. My introduction to the chestburster scene was actually the parody in SPACEBALLS where it bursts out of John Hurt - \"Not again!\" - and then does a musical number. My mum still claims to this day that ALIEN freaked her out more than any other due to that scene, which no-one in the audience in the cinema was expecting at all back in those pre-internet, pre-spoiler days.<br /><br />Apparently Dan O'Bannon was working on the new ALIEN film (a prequel to the original) when he passed away. I wonder if this will encourage Ridley Scott to drop the notion. I don't think we need a prequel to the first film or an explanation for the space jockeys and their ship. I can't seen conceive of any explanation that won't erase the mystery and power of that sequence in the original film.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 19 2009, 05:34:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"werthead","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"werthead","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"werthead","ctime_ts":1261200883,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/4314253/954808","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?replyto=8130725","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8130725#t8130725","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8130725#t8130725","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8130725#t8130725","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"doubleplus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://doubleplus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8130725,"talkid":31760,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8130725#t8130725","above":8128165,"upictitle":"Moonsilver: Apollo","article":"My best friend and I saw <em>Alien</em> in the theater, and it took nearly until the end of the credits for us to unclench our hands from the arms of the seats...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 19 2009, 19:38:24 UTC","parent":8128165,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://doubleplus.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"doubleplus","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"doubleplus","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://doubleplus.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"doubleplus","ctime_ts":1261251504,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/41676255/7669889","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?replyto=8128421","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8128421#t8128421","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8128421#t8128421","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8128421#t8128421","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"racebannon42","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://racebannon42.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8128421,"talkid":31751,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122533.html?thread=8128421#t8128421","upictitle":"racebannon42: Statler","article":"Dark Star is perhaps the worst movie I ever watched!
