{"itemid":1363,"subject":"We're #18!","event":"Which is a lot more exciting than it sounds.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;DANGEROUS WOMEN has come roaring out of the gate.&nbsp; The hardcover will debut at #18 on the NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list for December 22.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s just a hair too low to make the printed list, which only lists through #15, but it&#39;s still a sensational showing for an anthology, especially one as massive and expensive as DW.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also on the USA Today list (which aggregates all types of books, hard and softcover, fiction and nonfiction, into a single list) at #70.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s #25 on Ingram&rsquo;s internal &ldquo;Hardcover Fiction&rdquo; list.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;I love doing anthologies, but it is very rare than one of them sells really, really well.&nbsp; There have been some, of course... DANGEROUS VISIONS way back when, DARK FORCES during the horror boom, LEGENDS and LEGENDS II more recently...&nbsp; It&#39;s a short list, though, and Gardner and I are more than thrilled that DANGEROUS WOMEN is now on it.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s our readers who put it there, of course.&nbsp; So give yourselves a pat on the back, all of you who bought the book.&nbsp; And if you haven&#39;t yet... hey, get on it.&nbsp; Maybe we can climb up to #17 next week.\r\n\r\nAnd my thanks go out to Gardner Dozois, world&#39;s best co-editor (he does all the heavy lifting) and our incredible lineup of writers.&nbsp; Without you guys, nobody would be buying the book, since there wouldn&#39;t be one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Melinda Snodgrass, Diana Rowland, Caroline Spector, Diana Gabaldon, Steve Stirling, Carrie Vaughn, Megan Lindholm, Sharon Kay Penman, Megan Abbott, Brandon Sanderson, Nancy Kress, Lawrence Block, Jim Butcher, Joe Abercrombie, Joe R.
