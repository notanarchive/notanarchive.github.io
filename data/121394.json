{"itemid":474,"subject":"How Sweet It Is","event":"And down go the Dallas Cowboys, for a season sweep.\r\n\r\nOnly a SuperBowl tastes sweeter than a victory over the hated Cowboys.  Once again, as in the playoff game at Dallas two years ago, all the talking heads picked Dallas, and once again all the so-called experts were wrong.  If anyone had told me yesterday that Tony Romo would complete 41 passes and Eli Manning would complete 11, I would have figured the game for a Dallas blowout... but if anything, the final score should have been more lopsided in favor of the G-Men.  The last Cowboys TD was a gimme in garbage time, and earlier in the game our Steve Smith let a sure TD catch go skipping off his hands.  The keys to the victory were a pair of amazing plays, a catch-and-run by Brandon Jacobs, and a punt return for a TD by Domenick Hixon.  You'll see them on the highlight reels this evening.\r\n\r\nWill the G-Men make the playoffs?  Well, they have a chance now... but the road ahead still looks pretty damn rough, with the Iggles next week and the Vikings at season's end.  But for this one week, at least, life is magical and full of joy.\r\n\r\nPretty amazing week in the NFL all round.  Evil Little Bill and his P-men were upset as well, the Saints had a close call and an amazing win (has Dan Snyder fired that kicker yet?), and the Raiders knocked off the Steelers with Bruce Gradkowski doing his best Kenny Stabler imitation.  Things are getting really interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd Dallas faces the Chargers next week.  Maybe I won't need to kill Pat after all.\r\n\r\n(P.S. Flozell Adams is a thug, and may be the dirtiest player in the NFL).","ditemid":121394,"eventtime":"2009-12-06 18:40:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1260892759,"personifi_word_count":300,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"35:7,6:7,57:3,37:17,3:10,25:21,4:10,39:7,26:14,20:7,9:3,22:7,13:35,14:7,nterms:yes","interface":"flat","revnum":1,"revtime":1260150330},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-07 01:40:11","anum":50,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html","event_timestamp":1260124800,"reply_count":49,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/77594996/8474917","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?replyto=8088882","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8088882#t8088882","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8088882#t8088882","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8088882#t8088882","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"0pt1m1st1c","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://0pt1m1st1c.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8088882,"talkid":31597,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8088882#t8088882","upictitle":"i&#39;m the motha flippin&#39;: pic#77594996","article":"i'm glad the giants won today only for the sake of the eagles. next week, we're enemies.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 7 2009, 01:41:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://0pt1m1st1c.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"0pt1m1st1c","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"0pt1m1st1c","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://0pt1m1st1c.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"0pt1m1st1c","ctime_ts":1260150096,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?replyto=8089138","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8089138#t8089138","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8089138#t8089138","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8089138#t8089138","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"colin62","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://colin62.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8089138,"talkid":31598,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121394.html?thread=8089138#t8089138","upictitle":"colin62: pic#0","article":"My little brother's 8th grade coach was Conrad Doebler.
