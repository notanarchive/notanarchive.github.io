{"itemid":973,"subject":"Books for Xmas","event":"Every year, come the holiday season, we get a lot of orders for the signed books offered on my website:  http://www.georgerrmartin.com/books.html  \r\n\r\nThe biggest rush is in early and mid-December, from readers planning to use the books as Christmas gifts.  Often the buyers send extra money for priority mail, to make sure the books arrived by Christmas.\r\n\r\nAnd that's all great.  Usually.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000317xe/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000317xe/s640x480\" width=\"318\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBut this year, it's not going to work.  I am heading east the first couple of weeks of December, for reasons I cannot disclose yet, so I won't be here to sign books or ship them.  And when I return, mid-month, I'm going to be too busy digging out from under and doing my own holiday shopping to deal with orders.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002fe2b/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002fe2b/s640x480\" width=\"311\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we'll be closing the \"bookstore\" on December 1.  It will not reopen until the new year, after the holidays.\r\n\r\nSo if anyone out there is thinking of giving an autographed title of one of my old books as a Christmas present, please place your order in the next two weeks.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ka2qg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ka2qg/s640x480\" width=\"306\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThanks.
