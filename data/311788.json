{"itemid":1217,"subject":"Tuf Returns","event":"Haviland Tuf is back in print, once more sailing his ARK around the galaxy, courtesy of the good folks at Bantam Spectra, who released their reissue of TUF VOYAGING n January 29.  The new trade paperback contains all the wonderful Janet Aulisio interior illustrations from the Meisha Merlin hardcover edition, long out of print, as well as the complete stories first collected by Baen Books way back when, after their original publications in ANALOG, GALAXY, and ANDROMEDA.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/460/158238\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/158238/158238_300.jpg\" alt=\"Tuf Voyaging\" title=\"Tuf Voyaging\" width=\"196\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe TUF VOYAGING reissue should be available now at your favorite local bookstore or online retailer.\r\n\r\n(And for those who absolutely must have a hardcover, check out the Signed Books page of my website.  I still have some copies of the old Meisha Merlin hardback, as well as a fast-dwindling stock of their numbered and lettered limited versions, and would be glad to inscribe them on request.  First come, first served, for as long as the supply lasts).\r\n\r\nPS I am often asked if I will ever write any more Tuf stories.  The answer is yes, I would love to, and I have plenty of ideas for the further adventures of Tuf and Dax and the ARK.  It's just a question of finding the time.  Right now, as some of you know, I am kind of busy with the SONG OF ICE AND FIRE novels and GAME OF THRONES tv show, not to mention Wild Cards and my other anthologies.  So Tuf will need to wait.  But he's a patient guy, and I do hope to get back to him one of these days.\r\n\r\nPPS It has also been suggested that I make TUF into a TV series.  Hey, love to.  But it's not up to me.  I need to find a studio and network willing to back a new space show to the tune of many millions of dollars, and that's not easy.  I have pitched Tuf before, and hope to pitch him again, Real Soon Now, but honestly, he's a tough sell.  Television likes its starship captains sexy, like Kirk and Captain Tightpants and Rocky Jones.  Tuf is a towering, hairless, fat, pompouse fellow who talks like Alfred Hitchcock and loves pussycats.  Not an easy part to cast either... but hey, every time I see Conleth Hill playing Varys, I go \"Hmmmmmmmm.\"","ditemid":311788,"eventtime":"2013-02-09 20:05:00","props":{"taglist":"tuf voyaging, bantam spectra","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1361214029,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"ireland","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":2,"revtime":1361644827},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-02-10 03:05:13","anum":236,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311788.html","event_timestamp":1360440300,"reply_count":21,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125065505/49367467","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311788.html?thread=17247468#t17247468","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311788.html?thread=17247468#t17247468","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311788.html?thread=17247468#t17247468","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"geshtarr","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://geshtarr.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17247468,"talkid":67372,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311788.html?thread=17247468#t17247468","upictitle":"geshtarr: pic#125065505","article":"Tuf would make an amazing HBO mini-series, god, hopefully even a whole multi season series!

My brother Aegon reigned after him, when I had refused the throne, and he was followed by his son Aerys, whom they called the Mad King.\" -- Thus it seems that the TV-continuity has omitted Jaehaerys II (who was sickly and ruled only a few short years, but ruled well in those years)...apparently to simplify the relationship between Aemon, Aerys II, and Daenery.  Has Jaehaerys II been officially removed?  How was the decision made to remove him?  What about the wider ramifications of this?  <br /><br />Particularly for Dunk and Egg, Jaehaerys was his son, and removing him would make Egg the father of the Mad King.  And Aerys was insane due to his incestuous parentage, while Aegon V apparently married for love outside of the family (though of course, it was compound generations of 300 years of inbreeding).<br /><br />Moreover, this affects how the TV-continuity will establish the relationship between the Targaryens and Baratheons.  In the books, Jaehaerys' sister Rhaelle was the mother of Steffon Baratheon, father of the three Baratheon brothers (Robert, Stannis, Renly).  Robert's claim to the throne (and by extension, Stannis and Renly's) was based on this \"bit of dragon-blood\".  Is this now moved around so that Rhaelle is a sister of Aegon V? (in place of Rhae and Daella?  Or perhaps alongside them?)<br /><br />....OR, can the TV series later retcon this and just say that Aegon meant to say \"grandson\" and as a 100 year old man angrily recounting the fall of his House, it was just a slip of the tongue?
