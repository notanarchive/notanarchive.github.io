{"itemid":1435,"subject":"Hugo Nominations!","event":"The Hugo nominations for 2014 have just been announced as Eastercon in the UK, and other conventions around the world.&nbsp; You can find the full list here:\r\n\r\nhttp://loncon3.org/2014hugos.php\r\n\r\nGAME OF THRONES has been nominated in Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form this year, for &quot;The Rains of Castamere,&quot; the infamous Red Wedding episode, scripted by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and directed by David Nutter.&nbsp; Congratulations, all.&nbsp; The nomination is just the latest confirmation that David, Dan, T&#39;Other David, Richard Madden, Oona Chaplin, Michelle Fairley, and the rest of our cast and crew did an amazing job on this one, creating a moment that will live in the annals of television for a long, long time.&nbsp; No novelist has ever been more fortunate in the people who came forward to translate his work from the page to the screen.\r\n\r\nI would love nothing better than to have David, Dan, David, Bryan, and a whole contingent of our cast drop by this year&#39;s Hugo Awards.&nbsp; London is not that far from Belfast, after all.&nbsp; Whether that will happen or not, I cannot say, but I&#39;ll do my best.&nbsp; It would be great to have them all at worldcon.\r\n\r\n(Mind you, however, I think the odds of GAME OF THRONES actually winning this year are remote.&nbsp; &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; is up against an episode of ORPHAN BLACK, and four (4!!!) episodes of DOCTOR WHO, which has dominated Short Form since the category was created.&nbsp; Last year, in San Antonio, &quot;Blackwater&quot; broke DOCTOR WHO&#39;s long streak of victories, but I suspect that only served to rouse the Whovians, and this year the con is on their home ground in the UK, where they are legion.&nbsp; So GOT is a long shot at best, but hey... it IS an honor just to be nominated).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which... I am REALLY jazzed to be able to reveal, at last, that Jet City&#39;s <b>MEATHOUSE MAN</b> has also been nominated, in the Graphic Novel category.&nbsp;&nbsp; MM the graphic novel is the work of the amazing and talented Raya Golden, my sometime assistant and all-around minion, and long-time friend and quasi-goddaughter, based on a novelette that I originally wrote for Harlan Ellison&#39;s THE LAST DANGEROUS VISIONS back in the dawn of time (well, mid-70s) and eventually published in Damon Knight&#39;s anthology ORBIT 18.&nbsp; Written at one of the lowest points of my life, the novelette &quot;Meathouse Man&quot; is probably the darkest and most twisted thing I&#39;ve ever written, a story so personally painful to me that I can hardly stand to re-read it even now... that Raya chose this tale, out of all my stories, to adapt and illustrate as a graphic novel, producing a work capable of earning a Hugo nomination... well, that&#39;s just bloody incredible, and a real testament to her dedication, her talent, and her madness.&nbsp; Bravo!\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s my Hugo news.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the ballot... well, the good news is, more people nominated this year than ever before.\r\n\r\nAnd the bad news... well, you guys are smart, you can figure that out for yourself.&nbsp; And if you can&#39;t, there a hundred blogs that will tell you.&nbsp; I expect it will only be a matter of hours before someone starts talking about &quot;Hugofail.&quot;&nbsp; Prepare for the internet to go to war again.\r\n\r\nI will leave that to others.&nbsp; I am just thrilled for David and Dan and David, for HBO, and most of all for Raya.&nbsp; (FWIW, a couple years back, James S.A. Corey was nominated for Best Novel [should have been nominated again this year, actually], and James S.A. Corey is half Ty Franck, who was my assistant at the time.&nbsp; And now Raya is nominated.&nbsp; I think I may be the first writer to have two assistants to be nominated for the Hug.&nbsp; Cool).","ditemid":367496,"eventtime":"2014-04-19 16:30:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, graphic novels, fandom, game of thrones, comic books","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1399293546,"picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"revtime":1397946744,"hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-04-19 22:30:14","anum":136,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/367496.html","event_timestamp":1397925000,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/73828009/9963479","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/367496.html?replyto=19024008","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/367496.html?thread=19024008#t19024008","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/367496.html?thread=19024008#t19024008","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/367496.html?thread=19024008#t19024008","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"akakaki","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://akakaki.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19024008,"talkid":74312,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/367496.html?thread=19024008#t19024008","upictitle":"KAKI: Hulder","article":"Congratulations to GOT on the nomination!

I'd need to read its description again.<br /><br /><br />Btw as personal question towards the tv show. When you write a script each year for game of thrones do you ever go \"ah, should of wrote this a long time ago\" and then put into the script? of course i mean minor stuff like dialogue and character interactions I thought the script in the lion and the rose was fantastically written and i realized little hints where you might have thought it was smarter to put this rather than that.

This turns Dany into a girl who falls in love with her rapist instead of a girl who falls for one of the few human beings to show her respect.<br /><br />Last night's scene between Jaime and Cersei in the sept was unequivocally rape, instead of the slightly more ambiguous affair in the novel. In the novel, Cersei's initial denial of consent appears to be due to the fact that they're in the sept, rather than resistance to sex. In the books, the manner in which he continues is a bit troubling, but Cersei seems to go along with it. Though it is from Jaime's perspective and not an outside observer, so perhaps Cersei saw it differently? She certainly doesn't seem happy with him after the event, and she had a history of enduring Robert's sexual advances too. Yet on the show, there is no doubt that Jaime is forcing himself on her. <br /><br />Do you approve of the changes the show has made in this regard?

The nominations were higher because the WoT fan base organized to nominate the series. I can understand how people can be upset about this, but we never did this before. John Scalzi pointed out that since Worldcon is in England Charlie Stross may get the home town vote. I am voting as a non-attending member. This is my first time voting. <br /><br />I started reading WoT when I was 16 and I finished the last book at 38. Its hard to explain how reading a series over that length of time and starting at 16 means to me. I know George and Robert Jordan were friends. <br /><br />On the James SA Corey front, The Expanse is being made into a TV series (Im sure George knows this). I don't think the quality of SyFy shows is very good (though I liked Battlestar Galactica). I hope they do a good job with it. I would be more hopeful if it was picked up by AMC. I hope they don't turn it into something generic. <br /><br />I believe Ty's co-author Daniel Abraham is working on the Ice and Fire graphic novels right? He is one of my favorite authors. <br /><br />One thing I have complained about for a while with the Hugos... there are several nominations where they don't list the works. As a fan, how would I know what books a specific editor, edited? I am guessing it will be in the Hugo packet (never got one before), but I don't get why they don't list their works next to their names? <br /><br />I also can't figure out the difference between 'semi-pro' and fansite. It strikes me as the same thing. Anyone know? <br /><br />To pivot this back to George... I can't see anything being competitive with the Game of Thrones episode nomination. That is the most well known episode to date.
