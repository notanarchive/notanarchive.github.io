{"itemid":928,"subject":"Now It Can Be Told","event":"The HOLLYWOOD REPORTER has broken the story, so I'm now free to comment on a juicy little nugget of GAME OF THRONES news that I've been sitting on for a week or so:\r\n\r\nNeil Marshall has been signed to direct an episode for our second season.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have been living under a rock for the past ten years or so, Marshall is the director of CENTURION, of DOG SOLDIERS, and -- especially -- of THE DESCENT, which I think may well be the best horror film of the past twenty years or so.  (Do NOT confuse it with the sequel, a much weaker film).  GAME OF THRONES will be his first foray into television.\r\n\r\nAnd my comment?  \r\n\r\nThat sound you hear is a high-pitched squeal of delight.  \r\n\r\nI love Marshall's work, in case you couldn't tell.  \r\n\r\nAnd what makes this especially exciting is that the episode he'll be directing is... mine.  Yes.  He's going to directing episode nine, \"Blackwater.\"  The Battle of the Blackwater.\r\n\r\nI still don't how the hell we can possibly afford to do half of what I put into that script, but if anyone can pull off my budget-busting battle, it's Marshall.  \r\n\r\nFor more about our second season directors, check out the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER story at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-neil-marshall-season-234126","ditemid":237806,"eventtime":"2011-09-12 16:52:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":120,"commentalter":1317028967,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"iron throne","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1317155918},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-09-12 22:52:29","anum":238,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237806.html","event_timestamp":1315846320,"reply_count":52,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237806.html?thread=14658286#t14658286","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237806.html?thread=14658286#t14658286","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237806.html?thread=14658286#t14658286","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"boggak","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://boggak.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14658286,"talkid":57258,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237806.html?thread=14658286#t14658286","upictitle":"BK: pic#0","article":"Awesome!

I know that I probably won't get an answer and that you hear this often but your writing is amazing and I love the depth that you give your characters.  I made myself read as slowly as possible to make the book last a bit longer since I know it will be a while before the next one comes out but when it does I can almost guarantee that it will be my 30ish girly scream of delight that you will be hearing all the way from Georgia.  I'm excited about the prospect of Marshall directing episode nine and if the second season is half as good as the first I'm going to sob when it's over!  And if I am a very, very lucky lady you will be at DragonCon next September and I will have some small chance of getting your autograph on my book.
