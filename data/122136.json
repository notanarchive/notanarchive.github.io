{"itemid":477,"subject":"Green Sunday","event":"It was a good day to be wearing green in the NFL.\r\n\r\nThe Jets won their morning game convincingly, even with Mark Sanchez nursing his knees back in New York City and Kellen Clemens playing abysmally in his stead.  Hardly mattered.  Gang Green's running game was hitting, and the defense played lights out.  Of course, they were in Tampa Bay playing this year's Bucs, so it hardly counted.  Josh Freeman, the heralded Bucs rookie QB, looked just awful, but maybe some of that was Rex Ryan's D.  Still, these Bucs are so bad they ought to make them go back and wear the creamsicle uniforms until they start playing better.  \r\n\r\nThe Jets are still in the playoff hunt, but just barely.  They pretty much have to win out, and with the Colts and the Bengals on their schedule, I think that's unlikely.  And next week they have to beat Atlanta, who have a bad record but gave the Saints all they could handle today.  \r\n\r\nGreen Bay won as well.  Another \"green\" team.\r\n\r\nAnd, sadly, this evening the midnight green Iggles of Philadelphia defeated my Giants in a heartbreaker.  All the talking heads are saying what a great game it was.  Pfui.  It was an EXCITING game, yes.  The G-Men came out stumbling and spotted the Iggles to a two touchdown lead, then battled back for the rest of the game.  Every time they closed the gap to one score the Eagles would get punch in another one and widen it again.  Finally the Giants managed to take a one-point lead at 31-30... only to have the Eagles get a long TD on the very first play after the kickoff.  The scoring continued after that, and finally ended 45-38 in favor of Philadelphia.  The Giants racked up a ridiculous number of passing yards, and both teams left points on the board.  McNabb missed one wide-open receiver who was streaking downfield for what should have been a certain touchdown, receiver Mario Manningham of the G-Men had two endzone receptions disallowed for having one foot out of bounds, and his fellow wideout Hakeem Nicks had a couple of TD passes bounce off his hands.  There was also a Giants linebacker who dropped what would have been a certain pick-six served up by McNabb.  It too bounced off his hands.  (And weirdly, it wasn't a pass after all, but a forward fumble, but after our LB dropped it players on both teams just ignored the live ball lying there on the grass).  There were fumbles, a punt return for a TD, an freaky pass broken up by an Eagle that caromed off his thigh into the hands of the Giants tight end... lots of crazy, colorful, thrilling stuff.  Both teams played hard.\r\n\r\nBut a great game?  Pfui.  For fans like me, who appreciate defense, it was far from that.  Neither team brought their defense, from what I saw.  The Giants certainly proved themselves unable to stop the Eagles.  After ranking as the best defense in the NFL at season's start, our D has fallen apart.  Especially the pass rush.  McNabb had all day back there.  Eli played one of the best games I have ever seen him play -- his stats were off the charts, and would have been obscene if Manningham could have stayed in bounds and Nicks could have caught the balls that were bouncing off him -- despite the fact that he was under pressure every snap.  McNabb, on the other hand, could have filled out and filed his tax return in the pocket on a couple of those plays.  What the hell happened to the Giants' fearsome pass rush?  We have the same players as last year and the year before.  With added depth; by rights we should be better.  But Bill Sheridan, our new defensive coordinator, does not have them playing the same agressive attacking style that Spags did last year, that has made a world of difference.  Sheridan needs to go.  I want my Big Blue D back.  I like winning games 13-10 much more than losing them 45-38.  \r\n\r\nOddly, despite the loss, the Giants may still have a better chance of making the playoffs than the Jets do, provided the Cowboys continue their traditional December collapse.  But I am not holding my breath.  Next week's game against the Redskins has the look of a classic trap game.  After getting up emotionally for the big games against Dallas and Phillie, the Giants are all too likely to suffer a bad letdown against the Skins and get upset, which would effectively end their season.  I've seen it happen before.  And Washinton is better than its record.  And even if they get past the Skins, the Vikings are waiting at season's end.  The only silver lining in the clouds over the Meadowlands is the fact that the Giants own the tiebreakers over the Cowboys, so if both teams finish with the same record, New York goes to the playoffs and Dallas stays home.  But right now Dallas is a game up.\r\n\r\nLife is magical... but full of pain.","ditemid":122136,"eventtime":"2009-12-13 23:38:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":55,"commentalter":1261465973,"picture_keyword":"sad sack","personifi_word_count":864,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:11,18:4,35:9,6:4,33:3,10:4,11:9,37:4,16:11,3:4,25:9,20:7,9:9,22:3,13:15,14:4,nterms:yes","interface":"flat"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-14 06:38:03","anum":24,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html","event_timestamp":1260747480,"reply_count":49,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?replyto=8111384","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8111384#t8111384","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8111384#t8111384","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8111384#t8111384","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hh_mann","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hh-mann.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8111384,"talkid":31685,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8111384#t8111384","upictitle":"hh_frau: pic#92686519","article":"When I first glimpsed the size of this new blog entry, I got really excited.

Forsett, who was supposed to be \"featured,\" spent most of his time on the sidelines. Hasselbeck stumbled, fumbled and bumbled the entire game; apparently auditioning for the Raiders QB job next year.  That was just a joke of an effort, but the only game Seattle won against a team with a prayer of going to the post season was their surprising shut out of J'ville.  The remaining schedule is brutal after the Bucs, so the question is will we finish 5-11 or 6-10? Either is a slight improvement on last seasons 4-12 mark, but I think that team played better, with heart and intensity despite being decimated with injuries.

With that being said, out of the NFC East I would love to see the Giants go to the playoffs over the much hated Cowboys and the Eagles.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 14 2009, 15:46:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ronzerbayleaf.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ronzerbayleaf","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ronzerbayleaf","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ronzerbayleaf.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ronzerbayleaf","ctime_ts":1260805577,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/40434616/9272928","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?replyto=8117272","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8117272#t8117272","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8117272#t8117272","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8117272#t8117272","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"geek_domestic","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://geek-domestic.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8117272,"talkid":31708,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8117272#t8117272","above":8115736,"upictitle":"geek_domestic: Remus/Sirius","article":"<i>I do have faith in them though.</i><br /><br />As a 26 yr old life-long Northern Virginia native and Redskins fan, I giggle at this statement, because really, haven't we all held hope that a zombie JKC would come back to bitch slap everybody, eat Snyder's brain, and restore our team to its former glory?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 14 2009, 20:01:18 UTC","parent":8115736,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://geek-domestic.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"geek_domestic","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"geek_domestic","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://geek-domestic.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"geek_domestic","ctime_ts":1260820878,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?replyto=8116248","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8116248#t8116248","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8116248#t8116248","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8116248#t8116248","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"phillymos","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://phillymos.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8116248,"talkid":31704,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/122136.html?thread=8116248#t8116248","upictitle":"phillymos: pic#106744049","article":"My Sunday night was magical if tainted by the growing suspicion that the Eagles will never get far in the playoffs with a secondary this lousy at tackling.<br /><br />Sports enjoyment is for those that win and those who have no stake in either side like those talking heads.

We have yet to see the Giants do the same. They are done. <br /><br />Hopefully, Tom and Jerry will let Sherridan go and not give him a pass because of all of the injuries to keystone players. He may be \"brilliant\" like Sean Payton was when he penned his \"War and Peace\"/\"Thunder and Lightening\" of offensive schemes, just not here. <br /><br />While they are at it. If they bring back Pierce I hope it's as LB coach. His days as a starter are done, but he's football and media savvy. I think he will be a head coach someday. They also need to upgrade the defense... all of it. I hope they decide, finally, on what they want Kiwi to be. First they had him as a pass rusher, then they made him a LB, now they have him as a sometimes drop back lineman who plays the run and rushes the passer. Poor kid. <br /><br />They also need a running back like Bradshaw, only... football smarter. Can somebody please explain to me why Jacobs isn't the feature back? Whatever happened to handing the ball to big hog 20-24 times? Seems like they are still stuck with the Thunder and Lightening hangover. Where are you Derrick Ward?<br /><br />Jets have over-achieved. Or, maybe Rex is the reason. Or, the \"D.\" \"D\" as in Darelle. After a season and a 3/4ths, Thomas Jones seems to have finally found his old legs. Good for him. If Sanchez can mature as a man and stop behaving like he's a 15 year old who's parents went out of town for the weekend... I wonder if they can send him to military school? At least now the Sanchez vs. Clemens debate should be over. <br /><br />Strangely, I am not sad that both the Jets and Giants seasons are over. This has not been a winter of discontent.
