{"itemid":1649,"subject":"Once More, Into the Kennels","event":"Brad Torgersen has added a post to his blog: \"Sad Puppies: We Are Not Rabid Puppies.\"\r\n\r\nLarry Correia has also spoken up on MONSTER HUNTER NATION: \"I Am Not Vox Day.\"\r\n\r\nI commend them both for making the distinction so loudly and clearly.  And I accept what they say.  The Sad Puppies are not Rabid Puppies.  Larry Correia is not Vox Day.  I regret anything I might have done or said that blurred the line, or created a false impression that all Puppies were the same.  (Admittedly, having 'Puppies' in the name of both slates does foster confusion). I am glad you set that straight.\r\n\r\nBut now... sorry, sorry... I have a few more thoughts that have occured to me about Puppygate.  Questions, really.  \r\n\r\nI think we are all pretty clear on where the Rabid Puppy slate came from: Vox Day made it up.  He listed a lot of books and movies and editors and writers he liked, told his followers to vote for them, and they did.  Pretty cut and dried.  And that's the last I will say about the Rabids.\r\n\r\nI am a little more unclear on the process that created the Sad Puppy slate.  Brad, if I recall correctly (and do correct me if I am wrong), you said that you solicited nominations and suggestions from the readers of your blog.  Presumably Mr. Correia did the same on MONSTER HUNTER NATION.  Maybe other blogs were involved.  Sarah Hoyt?  I don't know.  In any case, you asked for suggestions, and you received a lot of them.  And from those, you produced the Sad Puppy slate.\r\n\r\nMy question, though... how did you go about the winnowing?  Presumably more than five books/ stories/ editors were suggested for each category.  Yet you did not throw them all onto a long Recommended Reading list, as happens, say, with LOCUS or NESFA.  Presumably some of your fans and readers did not see their own favorites reflected on the final list.  So how was the slate selected?  Were the books and stories you listed those that got the most votes?  In other words, was your process a sort of \"primary election,\" to select candidates for the general?  Alternatively, did you pick and choose, putting on some suggestions, discarding others?  Did you do that by yourself?  Was it you and Larry Correia?  You and Larry and some other people of like minds?\r\n\r\nIn your last blog post, your wrote:\r\n\r\n<b><i>\"The objectives of Sad Puppies 3 have been simple and consistent:\r\n\r\n● Use the democratic selection system of the Hugo awards.\r\n● No “quiet” logrolling. Make it transparent.\r\n● Boost authors, editors, and works — regardless of political persuasion.\r\n● Bring recognition to people who’ve been long overlooked.\r\n● Get some good promotion for new folks coming up in the field.\r\n● Have fun!</i></b>\"\r\n\r\nI will take you at your word that these were the aims of the Sad Puppies, as opposed to those of the Rabid Puppies, which seem to be more simply, \"Destroy the Hugos, outrage the liberals, and plunge all fandom into war.\"  \r\n\r\nI'll give you the fourth and fifth on your list.  You did bring recognition to people who had long been overlooked (whether it was a good sort of recognition is another question, but you certainly got their names out there), and you did generate lots of promotion for some newer folks, most notably the Campbell nominees, and, well, the two young writers who have withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI would quibble about your third stated aim.  Yes, you did include some women and some minority writers and some writers with different political views on your Sad Puppy slate, but... oh, hell, look, I will grant you that one too, for the sake of argument.  My interest is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd for aim number six -- have fun -- boy, howdy.  Are we having fun yet?  I'm not.  Are you?\r\n\r\nMoving on, though, I would like to focus on the first and second aims.  \r\n\r\nNumber one, you wanted to use the democratic selection method of the Hugo Awards.  And we're all in favor of democracy, of course.  Except... was your own selection procedure democractic?  The stories and novels on your slate, were those the ones that were selected most often, the ones that got the most nominations?  If you tell me they were, fine... then you had a primary.  But if you tell me that you (or you and Mr. Correia, or you and he and some other Sad Puppies) made judgment calls of your own from amongst the books and stories put forward by your readers... why, that would not be democratic at all.  That would be, well, a clique operating behind closed doors.  Maybe even a one-man clique, if it was just you.\r\n\r\nSo tell me, if you would: how did you get from lots of suggestions down to four or five per category?  What were your criteria, and who made the final choices??\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to your second stated aim.  \"No quiet logrolling.  Make it transparent.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hugo Awards have been transparent for decades.  Not always, admittedly -- final vote totals and nominations were not generally released in the 60s and 70s, and there were always rumors of funny stuff going on behind closed doors.  I credit Charles Brown and LOCUS with breaking that down, by making a point of demanding the hard numbers year after year, until the concoms finally began to do so.  This year, as for many years now, after all the rockets have been handed out, as the fans begin to leave the auditorium in Spokane, they will be handed sheets with a complete voting breakdown of every category.  Sometimes the complete list of nominating totals are included as well; if not, those turn up slightly later.  Nominations not just for the books and stories that made the ballot, but for all those that did not.  Everyone will be able to see how much they won by, how much they lost by.  Hard numbers.  Transparency.\r\n\r\n(I find these endlessly fascinating myself.  Every year, I find myself poring over the numbers at the Hugo Losers party, when I really should be drinking and flirting.  What can I say?  I can't help myself).\r\n\r\nI am sure I would be equally intrigued by your own \"primary\" numbers.  You favor transparency.  Would you be willing to show us your own \"primary\" results?  How many people made suggestions?  How many books were nominated?  How many votes did each of them get?  Were any passed over for the slate, and if so, why?  Hard numbers, same as the Hugos.  Just so, you know, fandom -- and your own Puppies -- can know for certain that no \"quiet log-rolling\" went on.\r\n\r\nOne last question.  You say you want inclusion.  You say you want democracy.  And you have already announced Sad Puppies 4, aimed at the 2016 Hugo Awards at Big Mac II.  I understand that Kate Paulk of MAD GENIUS CLUB will be running things next year.  I presume the mechanism will be the same -- a call for suggestions, which will then somehow be winnowed down to a slate.  (If that's wrong, do correct me, I want to have the facts).\r\n\r\nSo maybe my last question is for Kate Paulk rather than you or Mr. Correia.  I don't know.  But it's a simple question.  When you open up Sad Puppies 4 for nominations...\r\n\r\nCan <i><b>I</b></i> nominate?  \r\n\r\nI read a lot of books and stories.  I have editors and fan writers and artists I think are shamefully overlooked, same as you.  I am a fan too.  Can I nominate my own favorites, and be assured that they will be given equal weight to Larry Correia's nominations, and Brad's, and John C. Wright's, and all the other Puppies?  \r\n\r\nWe want democracy.  We want transparency.  We don't want log-rolling.  General elections need to be honest, but primary elections should be honest too.  And you guys do NOT believe in any sort of political litmus tests, I know, you've said as much a hundred times... so I know you will welcome my own suggestions for Sad Puppies 4, right?  Oh, and PNH and TNH, and N.K. Jemisin, and Connie Willis, and David Gerrold, and John Scalzi, and all my friends in the Brotherhood Without Banners... we all love science fiction, we all love puppies... \r\n\r\nCan we play too?","ditemid":422311,"eventtime":"2015-04-17 21:20:00","props":{"current_mood":"curious","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":56,"commentalter":1429828113,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Once More, Into the Kennels http://goo.gl/NbIx7B","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.639420193673916]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1429391682}","revtime":1429838882},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-18 03:19:42","anum":167,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html","event_timestamp":1429305600,"reply_count":262,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124180410/72790884","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21295015#t21295015","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21295015#t21295015","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21295015#t21295015","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2848157","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Bram_R","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21295015,"talkid":83183,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21295015#t21295015","etime_ts":"1429328399","article":"\"Snow!

I think it's fair to ask them--as you're doing here--how they came up with their choices, and how they'll do it in the future.  But their efforts were obviously highjacked by Vox Day.  I'm fairly sure Torgensen and Correia knew what Vox Day was doing, but I don't think they expected him to have been as successful as he was, and they ended up getting caught up in the ensuing shitstorm.

Right now the nominees of the past seem to be just the books that the blogs review, and the all seem to review the same exact books. <br /><br />The way I see it at the moment is that the Hugo process up until now has been kind of like the NIT, but it might have the potential to become March Madness, if and only if the focus can remain on the work. A lot of teams in the NCCA during the tournament won't win and everyone knows it, but the games are still fun to watch, and sometimes a small school like UW-Green Bay makes a run out of no where. We could have a process similar to that where books and authors are talked about long before voting begins, and even if they don't make the ballot at least fans will be exposed to authors and books that they may not have been exposed to. That definitely sounds a lot better to me that potentially having a 2-party system that could also happen.<br /><br />I hope that is what your post is alluding to.

While I don't generally buy the e-ARC releases, I did download the May 4 releases yesterday from the montly bundle and have already read two of them<br /><br />so, please, suggest away!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 18 2015, 06:50:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"SP selection process","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://davidlang.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"davidlang","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"davidlang","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://davidlang.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"davidlang","ctime_ts":1429339857,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116729836/48162977","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21316007#t21316007","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21316007#t21316007","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21316007#t21316007","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21316007#t21316007","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1137238","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/rcade","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21316007,"talkid":83265,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21316007#t21316007","above":21298855,"upictitle":"Rogers Cadenhead: pic#116729836","article":"\"i really do think that if you sent her suggestions, they would receive equal weight to other suggestions.\"<br /><br />Why should anyone assume good faith by future Puppies organizers and make suggestions to them?

But over at the Making Light voting wonk thread, there's a new proposal gaining support that would limit slates' power to take over the nominations, without using reweighting. It's called SVD-PE (Single Divisible Vote with Pairwise Elimination), and here's how it works:<br /><br />1. Eliminate all the works with fewer than 5 votes, just to simplify things for the organizers. <br />2. Divide up all the votes among all the works, with each vote giving a total of 1 point, spread equally between the works it supports that are still in the running.<br />3. Find the two works with the fewest points (or more, if there is a tie)<br />4. Eliminate whichever of those two is on fewer ballots. If it's a tie, eliminate both. <br />5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until they would take you below 5 finalists.<br /><br />Here's an example, simplified to a case where we want just 3 finalists, not 5. The candidates are letters, and the ballots are:<br /><br />AEIOU<br />DFAG<br />ABCX<br />BCD<br />B<br />XYZ<br />XYZ<br />XYZ<br />XYA<br /><br />For this mini example, in step 1 we will just eliminate the candidates with only one vote: EIOUFG.<br />Step 2 totals: A 1.083, B 1.583, C .583, D .833, X 1.833, Y 1.333, Z 1.<br />Steps 3 and 4: eliminate C and D (2 ballots each)<br />New totals: A 2.667, B 2.333, X 1.667, Y 1.333, Z 1.<br />Of Y (4 ballots) and Z (3), eliminate Z.<br />New totals: A 2.667, B 2.333, X 2.167, Y 1.833.<br />Of X (5 ballots) and Y (4), eliminate Y<br />New totals: A 2.833, B 2.333, X 3.833<br /><br />Done.<br /><br />Note that voting for EIOU did not end up diluting the first voter's support for A, and that the XYZ slate was unable to force B out of the finalists, as it only had enough voters to earn 1 slot.

I mean, it'd take two years to vote it into effect, but the analysis would show whether it's a viable option or a bad idea.<br /><br />As for the broader topic of Puppies-as-primary... that's what the nominating ballot itself is supposed to be for. To use an example I've used elsewhere (and swiped from a cable news pundit before that), suppose the U.S. presidential election was tomorrow, with no party conventions to winnow out nominees. That means, unless I've missed someone, that the ballot would list Cruz, Paul, Clinton, and Rubio. In a straight-up, no preference election, assuming equal numbers of Democratic and Republican voters, Clinton would walk away with the win - because all the Democrats are behind her, but the Republicans are split three ways. In essence, Clinton benefits from a primary-like effect that eliminated any competition within her base. The Puppy campaigns do the same thing for their nominees, concentrating a base behind the works they've slated.<br /><br />Finally, on the question of who selected the SP3 slate, Larry Correia stated on MHN that it was <a href=\"http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/02/09/sad-puppies-3-update/\" rel=\"nofollow\">selected by the ELoE</a>. As far as I can determine, ELoE is at least these five people: Larry, Brad, John C. Wright, Sarah Hoyt, and Vox. (It seems reasonable to conclude that Kate Paulk would be a sixth member, as she is leading SP4.) I have seen nothing about <b>how</b> the selections were made, or to what extent non-ELoE suggestions were considered. Not exactly transparent.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","below":21345447,"ctime":"April 19 2015, 01:27:58 UTC","parent":21299879,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Voting fixes","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rev-bob.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rev_bob","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rev_bob","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rev-bob.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rev_bob","ctime_ts":1429406878,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21345447#t21345447","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21345447#t21345447","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21345447#t21345447","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"davidlang","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://davidlang.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21345447,"talkid":83380,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21345447#t21345447","above":21336231,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","below":21348263,"parent":21299879,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Voting fixes","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://davidlang.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"davidlang","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"davidlang","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://davidlang.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"davidlang","ctime_ts":1429433991,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21360295#t21360295","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21360295#t21360295","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21360295#t21360295","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jamesonquinn","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jamesonquinn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21360295,"talkid":83438,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21360295#t21360295","above":21345447,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","parent":21345447,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Voting fixes","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jamesonquinn.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jamesonquinn","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jamesonquinn","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jamesonquinn.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jamesonquinn","ctime_ts":1429477287,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21348263#t21348263","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21348263#t21348263","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21348263#t21348263","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_937973","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000628630883","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21348263,"talkid":83391,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21348263#t21348263","above":21345447,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","parent":21299879,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Voting fixes","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000628630883","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Bradley W.

(But I think they did promulgate it.  There's a huge conceptual difference between even their slate and a traditional \"recommended reading\" list.)<br /><br />But Correia and Torgerson cannot pretend that they did not ally themselves and seek and accept the support of this toxic man.

As an average fan who didn't happen to read those blogs, I didn't hear about it, and if there was transparency in its voting I didn't hear about that either.<br /><br />But there's a larger point.  A \"primary\" of any kind is an attempt to game the system.  Whether it's technically legal is beside the point; it's a clear violation of the moral standards of the Hugos, unprohibited only because 1) it would be impossible to write such rules that couldn't be gotten around; 2) it never occurred to anyone that someone would try to do this.  (On the lines of the maid who quit when she found a baby alligator in the bathtub, saying, \"I didn't mention my objection to this because I never thought it would come up.\")<br /><br />What a \"primary\" does it what it does in politics: it lines everybody on one side up behind one set of candidates instead of asking them to vote for their own choices.  When the other side is disorganized and votes for whomever it pleases, this is a grotesque imbalance that produces grotesque results.  The only possible response is for the other side to organize its own political party and hold its own primary.  This is what has happened out in the real political world whenever a party has been one-sidedly formed in a non-party political situation.  Then the Hugos become a run-off between two opposing slates instead of the joint choice of individual fans, Puppy and non-Puppy alike.<br /><br />It would be a regrettable transformation, and the collective responsibility for it lies entirely on the Puppies.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 18 2015, 10:02:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kalimac.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kalimac","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kalimac","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kalimac.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kalimac","ctime_ts":1429351369,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124816334/75151068","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21315239#t21315239","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21315239#t21315239","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21315239#t21315239","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21315239#t21315239","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"michaeltho","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://michaeltho.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21315239,"talkid":83262,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422311.html?thread=21315239#t21315239","above":21300647,"upictitle":"Michael Thompson: pic#124816334","article":"\"But Correia and Torgerson cannot pretend that they did not ally themselves and seek and accept the support of this toxic man.

Has any Puppy of either denomination denounced Vox Day, as opposed to apologizing for him or unconvincingly dissociated themselves from him?\"<br /><br />I haven't see much evidence that suggests that anyone from the Sad Puppy movement sought out Vox Day.  What I have seen suggests that Vox Day glommed onto an already existing movement whose goals ran slightly parallel to his own, used its already existing symbology, and subsequently utilized the combined numbers of its existing membership with the numbers of his own blog followers to execute a power play in favor of his Imprint Castalia House against Tor.<br /><br />As far as Requires Hate goes, I'm not sure if discussion of her really belongs with discussion of Vox Day because the two phenomena are pretty different.  I do think its interesting that even though she is being used as an example of the left policing its own, the backlash of the left against Requires Hate only started in earnest after it was revealed that her most vicious troll attacks were leveled against people with whom members of the left sympathize - other women of color, minorities, other feminists, and so forth.<br /><br />I am dubious, as a result, that if the majority of Requires Hate's abominable behavior over the years was leveled at, say, presumably white men with names like Jack Jackson, who wrote Ender Wiggins fan fiction on EnderWiggins.Net, that the outcry against her would have been nearly as severe as what Laura Mixon revealed.<br /><br />I have no way to prove that of course, but I don't think I've ever seen examples from EITHER SIDE of the spectrum of people really doing much of anything to police the vicious trolls and toads of their own side when they start attacking people on the other side of the line.<br /><br />Until that starts to happen, I'm not sure how effective the measured dialogue of the few in the middle really will be.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years

And that's not even accounting for changes in technology; the Rabids are only able to do what they do because of recent rise of social media. Or what they're doing could cause so much attention to be paid to the Hugos that there would be a groundswell of opposition from new faces, which is essentially what happened with gamer gate that caused them to turn to the Hugos instead.

So, very, very, very amusing.<br /><br />Thank you, for finally making me laugh and enjoy this just a bit!<br /><br />Of course, it will probably not work, but if it doesn't it will expose a serious hypocrisy in a very amusing way.<br /><br />Good Luck!<br />Cheers,<br />dave","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 18 2015, 12:20:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Lovely!!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://davidjcutler.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"davidjcutler","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"davidjcutler","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://davidjcutler.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"davidjcutler","ctime_ts":1429359650,"tracked":0}]}
