{"itemid":1428,"subject":"Dunk and Egg","event":"<p>An update on all things Dunk &amp; Egg...\r\n\r\nTo date I have published three novellas about them.\r\n\r\n&quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; was published in Robert Silverberg&#39;s anthology LEGENDS, &quot;The Sworn Sword&quot; in its sequel, LEGENDS II.&nbsp; The third novella, &quot;The Mystery Knight,&quot; was part of WARRIORS, the crossgenre anthology I co-edited with Gardner Dozois.\r\n\r\nThe first two novellas were subsequently adapted into graphic novels, with scripts by Ben Avery and artwork by Mike S. Miller and Mike Crowell.&nbsp; The GNs have had a complicated publishing history.&nbsp; Originally they were published by the Dabel Brothers, in partnership with Image Comics and then Devil&#39;s Due.&nbsp; Later Marvel picked them up and had them out in hardcover for a time.&nbsp; Those editions are all out of print, however.&nbsp; Last year, Jet City Comics reissued both grahic novels.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a graphic novel of &quot;The Mystery Knight&quot; is currently in the works from Random House.&nbsp; Ben Avery has done the script once more, and Mike S. Miller is doing the art.\r\n\r\nTurning back to prose, however... it has always been my intent to write a whole series of novellas about Dunk and Egg, chronicling their entire lives.&nbsp; At various times in various interviews I may have mentioned seven novellas, or ten, or twelve, but none of that is set in stone.&nbsp; There will be as many novellas as it takes to tell their tale, start to finish.&nbsp; But only the three mentioned have been published to date.&nbsp; I did originally plan on including a fourth in DANGEROUS WOMEN, the crossgenre anthology Gardner and I put out last year, but the book was past due and the story was not finished, so I substituted an abridged version of &quot;The Princess and the Queen&quot; instead.\r\n\r\nThe unfinished novella was indeed set in Winterfell, and involved a group of formidable Stark wives, widows, mothers, and grandmothers that I dubbed &#39;the She-Wolves,&#39; but &quot;The She-Wolves of Winterfell&quot; was never meant to be more than a working title.&nbsp; The final title, when I finish the story, will be something different.&nbsp; There&#39;s also another Dunk &amp; Egg novella that I&#39;ve got roughed out in my head, with the working title &quot;The Village Hero.&quot;&nbsp; That one takes place in the Riverlands.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#39;s no telling when I will have time to finish either of these, or which one I will write first.&nbsp; I don&#39;t expect I will know more until I&#39;ve delivered THE WINDS OF WINTER.\r\n\r\nMy original intent was to publish all the Dunk &amp; Egg stories in a series of anthologies, and then collect them all together in one big book.&nbsp; But by the time of &quot;The Mystery Knight,&quot; it became plain that the stories were just too long, and there were going to be too many of them.&nbsp; So instead of one big book, the plan now is for a series of Dunk &amp; Egg collections, each comprised of three novellas.&nbsp; The first one to consist of the three published stories, &quot;The Hedge Knight,&quot; &quot;The Sworn Sword,&quot; and &quot;The Mystery Knight.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obvious title would have been THE HEDGE KNIGHT, but there is already a certain amount of confusion between &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; the novella and THE HEDGE KNIGHT the graphic novel, and we did not want to compound the difficulty, so the first Dunk &amp; Egg collection was titled A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS instead.\r\n\r\nSince the collection is comprised entirely of previously-published material, we wanted to add something extra for the fans who might already have read the stories in LEGENDS and WARRIORS.&nbsp; Some illustrations would be great, I thought (my love of illustrated books is well known by now, I suspect) and my British and American publishers agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We reached out to the amazing GARY GIANNI, who did all the artwork for the stunning 2014 Ice &amp; Fire calendar, not to mention Prince Valiant and those absolutely gorgeous Solomon Kane and Bran Mak Morn collections from Wandering Star.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary was interested in the project... but after reading the stories, he decided he did not want to do just a small handful of illustrations.&nbsp; He wanted to bring the whole book to life with his artwork.&nbsp; Last year at San Diego Comicon, he presented my editor Anne Groell and myself with a mockup of A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS as he envisioned it, with art on almost every page.&nbsp; Even as roughs, Gary&#39;s sketches were gorgeous.&nbsp; They blew us away.&nbsp; Of course we said yes.\r\n\r\nGary Gianni has been drawing and painting away ever since.&nbsp; Of course, it takes a long time to do so much artwork.&nbsp; Bantam Spectra and Harper Collins Voyager still hope to publish their fully-illustrated editions&nbsp; A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS in 2015, in the US and UK respectively, but the precise pubdate depends on when Gary finishes the art.&nbsp; Meanwhile, some of my other publishers around the world had acquired the rights to the Dunk &amp; Egg collection, and decided that they did not want to wait.&nbsp; Which is why A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS has already been published in several foreign languages, and will shortly be forthcoming in others, while the English-language editions won&#39;t be out for another year or more.&nbsp; This is an inversion of the usual publishing pattern, where the American and British editions come out first.&nbsp; The foreign editions have no artwork.\r\n\r\nI am frequently asked whether or not there are any plans for Dunk &amp; Egg movies or television shows.&nbsp; There has been interest, yes, but the rights situation is complicated.&nbsp; Film and television rights to the characters and the three published Dunk &amp; Egg stories remain with me at present... but HBO, when acquiring the rights to the SONG OF ICE &amp; FIRE novels, also acquired film and television rights to the world of Westeros.&nbsp; So if we did Dunk &amp; Egg with anyone else, we would need to remove all the references to House Targaryen, the Iron Throne, etc... not completely impossible, but certainly undesireable.&nbsp; Whereas if HBO decided they wanted to make a Dunk &amp; Egg miniseries or TV movies, they&#39;d first need to buy the stories.&nbsp; That&#39;s a much more attractive proposition for all concerned, I think... but if it happens, it will happen years from now, not tomorrow, and not next week.\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s where things stand on all things Dunk &amp; Egg.&nbsp; Thanks for asking.</p><p></p>","ditemid":365715,"eventtime":"2014-04-15 15:37:00","props":{"current_mood":"peaceful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"publishing, writing, dunk & egg","current_moodid":58,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1398121038,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"revtime":1398453076},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-04-13 21:37:49","anum":147,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html","event_timestamp":1397576220,"reply_count":61,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html?thread=18976403#t18976403","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html?thread=18976403#t18976403","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html?thread=18976403#t18976403","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18976403,"talkid":74126,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html?thread=18976403#t18976403","article":"I've Chabon's <em>Gentlemen of the Road</em>, which is beautifully illustrated with Gianni's artwork, and I've admired (but have yet to manage to find an affordable set of) the Wandering Star Conan books.
