He had over 37,000 posts discussing the books and Game of Thrones show as well as life insights. He moderated a reread of a portion of the novels. A memorial site was set up at <a href='http://towerofthehand.com/blog/2014/06/25-in-memory-of-scorchiebeanie/index.html?&#a,63' rel='nofollow'>http://towerofthehand.com/blog/2014/0<wbr />6/25-in-memory-of-scorchiebeanie/index.h<wbr />tml?&#a,63</a> and you can see the many folks whose lives he touched. The TOTH horde feels that a character named Scorch would be a great addition to TWoW and honor his memory. It is rare that a person who most know only through a conversation thread on the Internet can affect so many individuals, and it would be a fitting tribute for him to live on in your work.
