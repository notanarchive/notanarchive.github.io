He was so impressed that I almost didn't have time to get the book out of it first!<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with the text and the artwork. Both are fantastic. It's very clear that a tremendous amount of work went into this, and the hard work paid off. The production values are some of the best I've ever seen for this kind of book. Very, very impressive! It's definitely worth the extra money for the hardcover edition.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me, Westeros and Essos are calling to me...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"November 3 2014, 23:58:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/clonedllama","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"clonedllama","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2573139","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70685480&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"November 4 2014, 00:01:24 UTC","dname":"clonedllama","ctime_ts":1415059111,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124196842/72844884","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/387753.html?thread=19702185#t19702185","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/387753.html?thread=19702185#t19702185","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/387753.html?thread=19702185#t19702185","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2856350","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/adam.h.smile","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19702185,"talkid":76961,"etime_ts":"1415112050","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/387753.html?thread=19702185#t19702185","upictitle":"Adam Coburn: pic#124196842","article":"Congratulations on the book! I saw someone mention earlier about an 'Ice Dragon' animation film. I think a series of feature length animated films based on the 'a song of ice and fire' series would be equally as brilliant. The animated films would, if done right, be a closer adaption to the book than the tv series. It would be interesting to see 'asoiaf' characters looking as close to your own image of those characters as possible. Have you ever been tempted by the thought of an animated adaption of 'asoiaf'?
