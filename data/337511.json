He never came from a good place, he never had a conscience that could be challenged and worn away (at least as far as I can tell). Walt is a monster for entirely different reasons, and they are insidious reasons that are made more devastating because of who he used to be and how he changed. That look he gave *********, the way he told that character the truth only to hurt and destroy them more then anything else ever could, the way he can dismiss his humanity so readily when convenient, the coldness and the breaking of peoples spirit by knowing that to really destroy someone, it has nothing to do with what you do to their body, but their mind and heart. That's what makes Walter White a monster. Martin would have to create a character that we start off relating to, possibly loving, but then they would  become a monster that destroys the lives of the innocent, often without even laying a hand on them.

With Breaking Bad coming to a conclusion my heart hurts, but knowing we have Game of Thrones for years to come puts me a little bit more at ease.  <br /><br />Now, the SOIAF/Breaking Bad analogies have me thinking. Walt may indeed be the Tywin Lannister of Albuquerque but who resembles his noble brother-in-law? It has to be Jon Snow, right?<br /><br />Hank is driven by duty. He lives and breathes his work with the DEA and is nearly uncompromising in the pursuit of justice. When all others dismiss the chase for Heisenberg, believe it to be a fool's mission, and doubt the extent of his influence, Hank persists. Even his own pursuit of his brother is relentless. Forget all the family barbeques, forget their relationship, justice is justice. For the good of the realm, er, the ABQ, Walt had to be stopped. Last night's episode showed the extent Hank was willing to go to stay true to himself!<br /><br />I think Jon Snow has similar motives. Being a part of the Night's Watch, the realm's guardian/police force of the North, he has a duty to perform. The Watch has a code and emphasizes honor and protection. They protect the realm from those beyond the wall, just as Hank is responsible for protecting his region from external forces, some of those even coming from cartels beyond the United State's borders. Snow is adamant about following the code of the Watch, he believes in their cause and will do anything to realize that commitment. He wanted to be a ranger, strives to be on the front lines, accepts and desires responsibility. When those around him doubt their cause or ignore its magnitude, like Hank's focus on Heisenberg, Snow keeps the faith, stays focused. Both of these characters suffer physically and mentally for their beliefs, yet continue on.<br /><br />Sure, there are some differences, they are at odds in aspects of their personalities, have complicated motivations, and they do not obviously share each other's looks. Although Hank's glimmering bald head and his warm, stocky frame may evoke the same heartfelt sensations as the devilish looks as Kit's Jon Snow. It's all in the eye of the beholder! :)<br /><br />I am certainly savoring these next two weeks of Breaking Bad, with the likes of Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Downton Abbey, and many more shows on the air, this is one of the best periods of television in a long time. Looking forward to the Emmy's. <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"September 17 2013, 01:56:09 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Is Hank Schrader the Jon Snow of the ABQ?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Sam_Nylen","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Sam_Nylen","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2176630","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=66393872&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Sam_Nylen","ctime_ts":1379382969,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18251623#t18251623","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18251623#t18251623","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18251623#t18251623","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_449803","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000740978776","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18251623,"talkid":71295,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18251623#t18251623","above":18240359,"upictitle":"Jeff Bunting: pic#0","article":"Hank is not like Jon Snow, more like Eddard Stark.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"September 18 2013, 02:46:39 UTC","parent":18240359,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Is Hank Schrader the Jon Snow of the ABQ?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000740978776","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jeff Bunting","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_449803","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=35563918&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jeff Bunting","ctime_ts":1379472399,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/111833059/39628854","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18240871#t18240871","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18240871#t18240871","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18240871#t18240871","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_714317","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/john.thompson3","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18240871,"talkid":71253,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18240871#t18240871","upictitle":"John Thompson: pic#111833059","article":"As nice as an Emmy would be, I believe that \"Game of Thrones\" will be the first example that people from here on out will use when asked why anybody should take swords-and-sorcery fantasy seriously.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"September 17 2013, 02:24:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/john.thompson3","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"John Thompson","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_714317","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=39628854&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"John Thompson","ctime_ts":1379384693,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123749941/5573500","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18241127#t18241127","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18241127#t18241127","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18241127#t18241127","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18241127#t18241127","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"con_grazia","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://con-grazia.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18241127,"talkid":71254,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html?thread=18241127#t18241127","upictitle":"con_grazia: tail","article":"Walt redeemable for his phone call to Skylar?
