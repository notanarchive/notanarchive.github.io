{"itemid":528,"subject":"Odds and Ends and Snow","event":"Another snowy day in Santa Fe.  Winter has bloody well come, and refuses to leave.\r\n\r\nYesterday's SUICIDE KINGS signing at Barnes & Noble in Albuquerque went well, I think.  We had a nice, enthusiastic crowd and signed a lot of books.  Poor Vic Milan came down with some sort of creeping crud and had to cancel, but Carrie Vaughn, Caroline Spector, John Jos. Miller, Ian Tregillis, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Daniel Abraham, and yours truly were all on hand, defacing books.  We signed a considerable amount of stock as well, so if you're looking for an autographed title by any of the above, contact B&N at Coronado Center.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008rqb8/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008rqb8/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008sh6t/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008sh6t/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n(photos by Parris)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Wild Cards, we have some good news for my Italian fans.  I've just signed contracts for Italian language translations of the first three volumes of the series (WILD CARDS, ACES HIGH, and JOKERS WILD).  The publisher will be RCS Libri.  Needless to say, if these books do well, the rest of the series will follow in good tine.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, I'm going to be coming to Minnesota in November.  Fantasy Flight Games is bringing me in as a special guest for 'Days of Ice and Fire,' a weekend-long celebration of Westeros at FFG's new Events Center in Roseville, MN.  FFG will be running tournaments for their Ice & Fire card game and board games, and I'll be doing a Q&A, several signing sessions, and maybe a reading from A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.  More details can be found on FF's own site at http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1120  We'll know more about the schedule when we get closer to the event.\r\n\r\nAnother visit to a big midwestern city is in the works as well, and much sooner than the FFG event, but I can't talk about that one yet.  Watch this space.  Announcement soon.","ditemid":135305,"eventtime":"2010-02-21 15:44:00","props":{"taglist":"wild cards, foreign editions, fantasy

Sounds very cool (for those who want more info, see <a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/ASoWS/News/Entry/Battles_of_Westeros_New_Board_Game/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, and check the Hopeless Gamer front page, he has a couple more pictures up since I posted detailing the Stark and Lannister \"hero\" characters). Very tempting. <br /><br />The other board game is more strategic, and never quite caught my fancy, but this one... Maybe a better route to just use an existing battle system such as BattleLore; it was a shame Testors never got anywhere with their own tactical game. That all said, I can't imagine the people who spend their time actually painting all these little army figures, though. Too bad they can't produce those pre-colored somehow, I think it'd greatly broaden the appeal (but probably, also, the cost).<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"February 21 2010, 23:11:13 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1266793873,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/90477146/1038901","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135305.html?replyto=8862345","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135305.html?thread=8862345#t8862345","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135305.html?thread=8862345#t8862345","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135305.html?thread=8862345#t8862345","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135305.html?thread=8862345#t8862345","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dirtwitch","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dirtwitch.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8862345,"talkid":34618,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135305.html?thread=8862345#t8862345","upictitle":"DirtWitch: padre bow","article":"Any chance that Austin, Tx is on the list of cities to visit someday?
