John Miller will be writing the campaign setting.  Details on the Green Ronin website, my own website news page, and soon on John's live journal, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nWILD CARDS originally grew out of a role-playing game called SUPERWORLD, so in a sense we're going home again.  I'm sure that John will do a great job... and Green Ronin makes some seriously cool games.","ditemid":18639,"eventtime":"2007-08-16 11:38:00","props":{"taglist":"wild cards","commentalter":1188507192,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-08-16 17:42:24","anum":207,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/18639.html","event_timestamp":1187264280,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/11683689/999848","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/18639.html?replyto=2234575","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/18639.html?thread=2234575#t2234575","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/18639.html?thread=2234575#t2234575","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/18639.html?thread=2234575#t2234575","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"chgriffen","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://chgriffen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2234575,"talkid":8728,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/18639.html?thread=2234575#t2234575","upictitle":"Christian Griffen (xenopulse): pic#11683689","article":"Awesome.

So I wanted to throw my two cents in.<br /><br />I love your writing. Philosophy and such might be the main course I need to survive but it's fantasy that tastes the sweetest. And between you and Robert Jordan I am ruined for all other fantasy. I've tried. Seriously, it's a line most times I wish I hadn't crossed. And you take so long, the both of you, that most days it's excruciating. But I wouldn't want you to change a thing. If you take 5 years to make A Dance with Dragons, that was how long it took to make it right. You don't fuck with genius, pardon my french, and you don't ask Mozart to write faster. Whatever you're doing works so well I'd have to agree you've \"elevated the fantasy genre to prose\", and I hope you don't ever  feel pressured to rush. They're just kids who want their sweets early anyway.<br /><br />Deepest thanks,<br />Charles ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"August 25 2007, 11:02:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Deadlines","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://shugyosha11.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"shugyosha11","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"shugyosha11","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://shugyosha11.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"shugyosha11","ctime_ts":1188039747,"tracked":0}]}
