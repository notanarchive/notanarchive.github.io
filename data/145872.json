This is a great opportunity for anyone who hasn’t purchased pieces to get them at a discount.  But don’t worry, if you have already purchased pieces,  we will give you even more of a discount if you wish to purchase more pieces. \r\n\r\nOur new website is still at  the same web address: www.valyrianresin.com.\r\n\r\nNED STANDARD\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000kdpe/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000kdpe/s320x240\" width=\"226\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nOur new web-store is located here: http://stores.valyrianresin.com/StoreFront.bok\r\n\r\nYou can click on the Shoppe button on any page of our website to access our web-store.  The Ice and Fire page of our website features some previously unreleased design drawings you may want to check out.   \r\n\r\nNED VARIANT\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000ptw5/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000ptw5/s320x240\" width=\"225\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nHere’s how the sale will work.  All Variants and Regular pieces when purchased individually, or two at a time are $10 off.  If you buy a set of variants, or a set of regular pieces ( a set is a set of three variants or regular pieces) you will receive $40 off.  If you are a repeat customer send us and email and we will further discount your purchase!  \r\n\r\nDANY VARIANT\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000r5d4/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000r5d4/s320x240\" width=\"235\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAll of these discounts are already applied to the different products on our web store.   So if you purchase individual pieces or sets the discounts are already applied.  However, for repeat customers, you must email us to get the further discounts we are offering!\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are a retailer or just a group of Ice and Fire fans who have come together to purchase a bunch of pieces, you may qualify for a wholesale rate for even further discounts!  Just send us and email (either by emailing jhaigh@valyrianresin.com) or simply by clicking on the contact button on any page of our web-site and we can discuss group and wholesale rates.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your support\r\n\r\nJed Haigh\r\nValyrian Resin\r\n\r\n================================================================ \r\n\r\nHOUND VARIANT\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0009grpb/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0009grpb/s320x240\" width=\"231\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nSupplies are limited, and no more of these figures will be produced, so once these are gone, that's that.
