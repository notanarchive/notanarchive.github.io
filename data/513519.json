{"itemid":2005,"subject":"I Hate Football","event":"The Giants lost a heartbreaker of a game to the Iggles down Philly way.   With the playoffs in sight, suddenly Eli starts throwing INTs right and left and the wideouts start dropping every other pass.\r\n\r\nAnd then today the Jets got totally crushed, eviscerated, and humiliated by Evil Little Bill, Tom the Deflator, and the Patriots (and their newest wideout, straight from an Arizona jail). It was not just a loss, it was an embarassment.  The coach made the game, after being hospitalized yesterday, but the team did not show up.\r\n\r\nI hates me some football.\r\n\r\nLife is meaningless and full of pain.\r\n\r\nChristmas, you say?  Santa, you say?  No, no, that's Nackles you hear.","ditemid":513519,"eventtime":"2016-12-24 16:06:00","props":{"current_mood":"frustrated","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Dec 24 23:06:31 2016]R [Sat Dec 24 23:06:32 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/812796631179522048 ","current_moodid":47,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1482900815,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/812796631179522048","reading_time":1,"ratingbot_comment":"[cyr:-|ua:-|noncyr:24|by:-|ru:-|rureg:-]","picture_keyword":"sad sack","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.735951256262049]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1482620972}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2005?v=1482906394","revtime":1482900853},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-24 23:06:31","anum":239,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html","event_timestamp":1482595560,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126925994/79919867","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25442799#t25442799","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25442799#t25442799","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25442799#t25442799","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"danihinze","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25442799,"talkid":99385,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25442799#t25442799","article":"Agreed. <br /><br />:) ","upictitle":"Dani Hinze: pic#126925994","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"4 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"December 24 2016, 23:17:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"i hate football as well ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"danihinze","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"danihinze","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"danihinze","ctime_ts":1482621425,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126950265/80129736","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443055#t25443055","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443055#t25443055","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443055#t25443055","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3945329","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/JeremyAtoZ","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25443055,"talkid":99386,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443055#t25443055","upictitle":"Jeremy A to Z: pic#126950265","article":"Is the Mountain available?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"December 24 2016, 23:17:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Jets OL","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/JeremyAtoZ","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"JeremyAtoZ","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3945329","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=80129736&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"JeremyAtoZ","ctime_ts":1482621473,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119901125/59452072","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443311#t25443311","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443311#t25443311","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443311#t25443311","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1606515","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/patrick.wagner.92317","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25443311,"talkid":99387,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513519.html?thread=25443311#t25443311","upictitle":"Patrick Wagner: pic#119901125","article":"Whats your pick?
