It will be called A FEAST OF ICE AND FIRE.\r\n\r\nBut I'll let  them tell you about it, here:\r\n\r\nhttp://innatthecrossroads.com/2011/09/30/cookbook-of-ice-and-fire/\r\n\r\nRead all about it... and check out their blog while you're at it, and you may be baking lemocakes in no time.","ditemid":241462,"eventtime":"2011-10-01 01:05:00","props":{"taglist":"food, a song of ice and fire","current_moodid":18,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1318957396},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-10-01 07:06:53","anum":54,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241462.html","event_timestamp":1317431100,"reply_count":0}
