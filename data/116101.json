Hopefully they'll have Dreamsongs vol 1, cuz finding a copy has been an uphill battle. Having just finished vol 2 I want to get my hands on its predecessor and Tuf Voyaging. I must confess I was in the camp of people who'd sigh when you posted anything unrelated to aSoIaF. Wild Cards? Pfft. Football? Ugh. What about Dance, I'd think.<br />Reading your earlier stories and about how some of them came to be was really enjoyable. I especially enjoyed finding out your another comic geek, chess playing Jersey boy. And that Marvel Comics also turned you down. DC was much more encouraging and actually give unknowns a shot. Marvel just waits until your a known commodity then swoops in with their bigger checks. Anyway, it was an eye opener to imagine what might have never been had you got the job. You'd have definitely gnawed both your hands off at this point. So sad how many of those early creators died penniless.<br />In that light I was able to look at Wild Cards without the petulant attitude and was really able to enjoy the two stories I read. <br />In fact almost every one of the stories had me wishing I could continue with their adventures. So aside from my fervent desire to read Dance I now also hope for new full novels of Tuf, The Turtle, the Wisdom of Croan'dhenni, and even bitter ass Bunnish.<br />Also your thoughts on the whole concept of what is good sci fi, fantasy, western, etc. really struck a cord with me. Throughout my life I've always held my favorite authors as sort of a guilty pleasure. Both protective of and apologetic for. Many an argument with a Lit professor or high brow psuedo-intellectual stemmed from my guilty/defensive love of Stephen King or Anne Rice. Shit most recently with you. I read aSoIaF, really enjoyed it and then when I was recommending it to a friend I noticed myself dancing around the genre itself with vague descriptions of the story. Afraid of referring to it as fantasy as if I'd then be looked at as a pervert and my recommendation would definitely then be ignored. Like I was forcing a Playboy onto a friend in the school yard, hoping not to get caught.<br />Hearing (reading) your thoughts on Galaxy's old legend put a smile on my face and made me think not to take myself so seriously. As if what a person enjoys to read is the definitive statement of their character. I mean it's not like a person who reads Us Weekly is superficial....oh, shit! Lol. Thanks again. Won't be seeing you but hope to soon see a signed copy of Tuf or Dreamsong.
