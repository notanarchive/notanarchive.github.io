She went from playing one of the most emotional characters on TV to one of the most emotionless (in Sarah Connor Chronicles). Such a talented actress. I know there are actors from Firefly who really want to be in Game of Thrones (Nathan Fillion, for example, began reading the books). I don't know who Summer could play. Maybe Val? Or Taena of Myr? If nothing else, she's gorgeous enough be a high-level whore.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"February 1 2014, 20:57:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Summer Glau","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/117506210726793976965","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jason Smith","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2408605","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=68752964&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jason Smith","ctime_ts":1391288227,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354820.html?thread=18660868#t18660868","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354820.html?thread=18660868#t18660868","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354820.html?thread=18660868#t18660868","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18660868,"talkid":72894,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354820.html?thread=18660868#t18660868","above":18660100,"upictitle":"George R.R.
