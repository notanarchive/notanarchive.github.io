{"itemid":730,"subject":"G-Men!!","event":"Kicking ass and taking names!\r\n\r\n(Of course, it was only the Potomac Drainage Basin Indiginous Persons.  Gets tougher the next three weeks.  And that interception by Eli was worrisome.  A lot of his INTs this season have not been his fault; he'd put the ball right on the receiver's hands, only to have it bounce off into the hands of a defender.  But that endzone INT was insane.  He threw right into the middle of three defenders).\r\n\r\nThe running game looked great.  And Derek Hagen stepped up big.  I still want my Steve Smith and Hakeem Nicks back, though.\r\n\r\nJason Pierre-Paul is starting to show why the Giants drafted him.  Good pick.  Especially if Kiwi can't come back from his neck injury.","ditemid":187047,"eventtime":"2010-12-05 14:00:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1291866989,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":126,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_backdated":1,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"35:6,45:6,10:12,31:6,11:18,57:6,36:6,3:12,25:6,4:12,20:25,9:25,22:18,13:6","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1291867361},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-12-05 22:00:31","anum":167,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/187047.html","event_timestamp":1291557600,"reply_count":4,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/187047.html?thread=11427751#t11427751","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/187047.html?thread=11427751#t11427751","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/187047.html?thread=11427751#t11427751","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kotite4ever","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kotite4ever.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11427751,"talkid":44639,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/187047.html?thread=11427751#t11427751","upictitle":"kotite4ever: pic#0","article":"Are you caught up on the Jets yet?
