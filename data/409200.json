{"itemid":1598,"subject":"Return to Venusport","event":"Remember Venus?  No, no, not the hellhole that NASA found, with its acid rains and searing temperatures, but Old Venus, the Venus of our childhoods, the Venus of Burroughs and Moore and Bradbury and Brackett and Heinlein and Zelazny... the Venus that Astro hailed from... shrouded in clouds, mysterious, teeming with dinosaurs and endless swamps anmd furtive web-footed Venerians?\r\n\r\nWho says you can't go home again?  Old Venus awaits you.  OLD VENUS, the latest original anthology from me and my co-conspirator Gardner R. Dozois, goes on sale today at a bookstore near you, or from your favorite on-line bookseller.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/236983/236983_900.jpg\" alt=\"Old Venus final jkt\" title=\"Old Venus final jkt\">\r\n\r\nHere's the table of contents:\r\n\r\nThe final lineup:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION, by Gardner Dozois\r\nFROGHEADS, by Allen M. Steele\r\nTHE DROWNED CELESTRIAL, by Lavie Tidhar\r\nPLANET OF FEAR, by Paul McAuley\r\nGREEVES AND THE EVENING STAR, by Matthew Hughes\r\nA PLANET CALLED DESIRE, by Gwyneth Jones\r\nLIVING HELL, by Joe Haldeman\r\nBONES OF AIR, BONES OF STONE, by Stephen Leigh\r\nRUINS, by Eleanor Arnason\r\nTHE TUMBLEDOWNS OF CLEOPATRA ABYSS, by David Brin\r\nBY FROGSLED AND LIZARDBACK TO OUTCAST VENUSIAN LEPERS, by Garth Nix\r\nTHE SUNSET OF TIME, by Michael Cassutt\r\nPALE BLUE MEMORIES, by Tobias S. Buckell\r\nTHE HEART'S FILTHY LESSON, by Elizabeth Bear\r\nTHE WIZARD OF THE TREES, by Joe R. Lansdale\r\nTHE GODSTONE OF VENUS, by Mike Resnick\r\nBOTANICA VENERIS: THIRTEEN PAPERCUTS BY IDA COUNTESS RATHANGAN, by Ian McDonald\r\n\r\nOLD MARS was a great hit with fans of old-fashioned space opera and planetary romance, and we think OLD VENUS is even better... and there's one story in there that's so bloody good that if it doesn't win the Hugo and Nebula both, I'll count it as a major injustice.  Which one?  Ah, I will leave you guys to figure that out.  But first you'll need to read the book.","ditemid":409200,"eventtime":"2015-03-03 11:48:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"Venusport","taglist":"anthologies, science fiction, publications","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1425598110,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Return to Venusport http://j.mp/1wRSgOO","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.720875900488608]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1425408553}","revtime":1426123309},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-03 18:48:41","anum":112,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409200.html","event_timestamp":1425383280,"reply_count":13,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123692389/50421741","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409200.html?thread=20325232#t20325232","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409200.html?thread=20325232#t20325232","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409200.html?thread=20325232#t20325232","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dragonborngurl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20325232,"talkid":79395,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409200.html?thread=20325232#t20325232","upictitle":"L’esprit de l’escalier: pic#123692389","article":"can't wait to read these!
