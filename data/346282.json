I think the big deal that year was Ghostbusters along with a sea of comic books. On the schedule, was a tribute to Robert Heinlein, which got me very excited as I was (and still am) a big fan of the Dean. Then I get to the panel only to find out it was a MEMORIAL tribute! Apparently the man had died! I sat there bummed for the whole panel. <br />Later I was cheered up by purchasing X-men 101 which is the emergence of Phoenix. I saw alot of comics there I wanted but didn't have the money at the time. Of course, SDCC has gotten huge over time, but I wanted to share that Woody Allen-esque experience with you.
