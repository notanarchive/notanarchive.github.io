{"itemid":1794,"subject":"Monday Night Victory","event":"Hey, hey, hey, whattaya know... the Giants finally broke their losing streak and won one, a 31-24 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Monday night.  They actually came from behind, taking a lead early in the fourth quarter and than <b><i>HOLDING IT</i></b>, grounding out the yards with runs and short passes, moving the chains, eating the clock, keeping the ball away from the Miami offense until it was time to kneel down.  \r\n\r\nIf they had done the same things in the four games they blew earlier this season, Big Blue would now be 10-3 instead of 6-7.  They would have long ago wrapped up the pathetic NFC East and would be looking ahead to the playoffs.  But no...\r\n\r\nInstead, well, hard as it is to believe, even at 6-7 they are still tied for the division lead with the Eagles and the Redskins, and still have a slim chance to win the division.  \"Slim\" because they have by far the hardest schedule of the three leaders in the last three games.  The schedule favors the Potomac Drainage Basin Indiginous Peoples.  But this is the NFL, so anything could happen.  Even the Cowboys have a tiny sliver of hope, if the other three teams all collapse.\r\n\r\nLet's enjoy last night before worrying about next week, however.  Eli Manning played the best game I've ever seen him play, completing something like 85% of his passes and tossing four touchdowns without an interception.  And Odell Beckham Junior was just sensational.  He has become the best wideout in the NFL, I think... at this point in time, at least.  Why the Fish did not triple team him every play, I have no idea.  It's not as if the G-Men have any other threats.  It does make one wonder how great the Giants offense could have been if only Victor Cruz had been healthy this season.\r\n\r\nOn the defensive side of the ball, however... well, JPP showed flashes, but aside from that, things looked pretty grim.  And the injuries continue to pile up, especially among the linebackers.  We're down to fourth string guys now.  Any more losses, and they may be asking Harry Carson and Lawrence Taylor to suit up again.\r\n\r\nThe Giants desperately need to add some stud linebackers and pass rushers in free agency and the draft.  Meanwhile, however, we have the high-flying Carolina Panthers and Cam Newton coming to town next week.  Maybe if Eli and Odell can duplicate this week's heroics, we can look forward to another shootout like the New Orleans game... but we all remember how <i><b>THAT </b></i>one ended.","ditemid":459405,"eventtime":"2015-12-15 15:16:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Dec 15 22:15:22 2015]R [Tue Dec 15 22:15:24 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/676888312284471296 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1450469522,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/676888312284471296","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.727920113664342]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1450227507}","revtime":1450746010},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-15 22:15:19","anum":141,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html","event_timestamp":1450192560,"reply_count":15,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124221263/72950698","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256205#t23256205","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256205#t23256205","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256205#t23256205","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2868355","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/grace.navarro.73","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23256205,"talkid":90844,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256205#t23256205","upictitle":"Grace Navarro: pic#124221263","article":"Mr. Martin, the Seahawks are coming.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 15 2015, 22:16:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/grace.navarro.73","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Grace Navarro","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2868355","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72950698&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Grace Navarro","ctime_ts":1450217811,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256717#t23256717","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256717#t23256717","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256717#t23256717","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23256717,"talkid":90846,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459405.html?thread=23256717#t23256717","above":23256205,"upictitle":"George R.R.
