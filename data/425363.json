{"itemid":1661,"subject":"More Hugo Musings","event":"Continuing the musings I began last night, about this year's Hugo ballot... the actual nominees, the work, rather than the politics...\r\n\r\nThis one will be shorter than my last, since I don't have much to say (yet) about the three fan categories I want to touch on.\r\n\r\nBEST FANCAST is a stupid new Hugo category created to keep \"fancasts\" out of the hoary old Best Fanzine category.  The nominees this year include three Puppy picks, and two that were not on the slates.  I haven't heard any of the five.  I doubt I will be voting in this category.\r\n\r\nBEST FANZINE is the aforementioned hoary old category that dates back almost to the start of the Hugos.  Here They Speak Twilltone and Gestetners, and then oldtimers mutter darkly about Ditto.  But there are e-zines here as well.  The Puppies grabbed four of the five slots in this category.  Only JOURNEY PLANET was not part of the slates.  However, one of the Puppy finalists, BLACK GATE, has withdrawn, leaving three.  The only one I know well is Dave Truesdale's TANGENT, the online continuation of the an actual print fanzine that Truesdale has been publishing since the 70s.  TANGENT has been nominated for Hugos before, I believe, though I don't think it has ever won.  It's what trufans call a \"sercon\" zine, that is, mostly book reviews and criticism.  Book reviews also seem to be the main focus of ELITIST BOOK REVIEWS, another Puppy pick... which seemed to me a lot like TANGENT, but not nearly as well done.  There are much better review 'zines and blogs than these to be found on the internet, among them PAT'S FANTASY HOTLIST, the WERTZONE, BLOG OF THE FALLEN, and last year's winner, A DRIBBLE OF INK, but none of those made the ballot, so we will need to choose from those that did.  I don't always vote in the Fanzine category (please note, I am saying <i>I do not vote</i>, not that I vote NO AWARD, two different things), but I expect I will this year.  I still need to check out a couple of the remaining nominees, and look more deeply at the ones I was already familiar with.\r\n\r\nBEST SEMIPROZINE.  This category has always pissed me off, since it was created largely to kick LOCUS out of Best Fanzine, where it was winning every year.  Of course, once Semiprozine was created, LOCUS proceeded to win that a bunch of times too, until the rules were jiggered once again to kick it out once more.  (This is one reason I oppose jiggering the rules, even to stop the Puppies).  They really ought to call this category BEST SEMIPROZINE THAT ISN'T LOCUS.  But they don't.  We have five finalists here, only two of which are from the slates... and one of those, ANDROMEDA SPACEWAYS IN FLIGHT MAGAZINE, has been loudly declaring that they were not informed and never asked to be on anyone's slate.  I am really only familiar with LIGHTSPEED and STRANGE HORIZONS from this category.  Both of those are pretty good.  If anyone has an opinion to offer on the others, do speak up.  If I have time to check them out, I will... if I don't, I will abstain in this category, i.e. not vote.  I won't go NO AWARD, since I do think the two semipros I know are worthy.  Not as worthy as LOCUS, mind you, but there you are...\r\n\r\nAnd that's all I have to say about those.  For now, at least.\r\n\r\nTalk among yourselves.","ditemid":425363,"eventtime":"2015-04-30 01:44:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo award, worldcon, fandom","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1430845986,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"More Hugo Musings http://goo.gl/FdRP56","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"ireland","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.715324723304206]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430379912}","revtime":1430860475},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-30 07:44:22","anum":147,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html","event_timestamp":1430358240,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124449162/73852024","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21549459#t21549459","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21549459#t21549459","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21549459#t21549459","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21549459#t21549459","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2954057","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/TheNighIsDark","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21549459,"talkid":84177,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21549459#t21549459","upictitle":"A K: pic#124449162","article":"I think you single-handedly boosted their entry numbers immensely with all your posts about the Hugo awards.

Glad you liked the art - I make sure ALL the artists read the stories they illo.  :-) We've done 22 issues since then and started a lot of careers of folk you will have heard of, or published them early in their careers. Aliette De Bodard, Rachel Swirsky, Jim C Hines, have all appeared in ASIM at one time or another. There are more, but those came to mind immediately. We're Semiprozine because everyone gets paid except us. We're fine with that - we all have day jobs, but ASIM is what we do for love. And when people do go on to big careers and Nebula, World Fantasy and Hugo nominations we couldn't be more thrilled. I had six first sales in my issue, the one you will probably get in your Hugo pack, and I do urge you to read them, even if you don't vote for us, because there are at least a couple of whom you are likely to hear again. <br /><br />And it's true, Mr Martin, we had never even HEARD of this bunch of loonies till a few days before the shortlist went up. You have to remember, even with the Internet, not everybody knows what is going on in US fandom. Frankly, I suspect they put us up because the title starts with A in Ralan. We were terribly excited to get the email and said yes, please do put us up...and then one of us said, \"Uh, guys, take a look at this..\"  And then we discussed it and argued about it and then suddenly the deadline was over and we were still on the list, so we're just getting on with things and see what happens.

I do think however that I have gained an understanding of where you derive some of your inspiration for the intrigue at the core of Game of Thrones. ;) ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 30 2015, 16:03:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Who knew?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://storm59.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"storm59","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"storm59","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://storm59.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"storm59","ctime_ts":1430409818,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/19881723/1153716","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21556371#t21556371","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21556371#t21556371","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21556371#t21556371","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21556371#t21556371","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mmaresca","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mmaresca.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21556371,"talkid":84204,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21556371#t21556371","upictitle":"Marshall Ryan Maresca: pulp","article":"Frankly, I've long been at a loss to understand the distinction between \"fancast\", \"fanzine\" and \"semi-pro zine\".

Well, except for semi-pro. That's always been a bit of a... dodge.<br /><br />See, I've done podcasting, and been a radio professional for a lot longer than a podcaster; I've also published several fanzines (print and electronic), two of which, both print, would be pushed into \"semi-prozone\" under modern rules*. Having done these two media <em>extensively</em>, they are, to me, <em>very different art forms</em>, particularly on the production side. The skillsets have some overlap, but there are also huge, huge areas of disparity.<br /><br />And I find the content - of the ones I've listened to, anyway, which actually does not include the current nominees - to be meaningfully different as well. Don't get me wrong; you can wodge an audio podcast into fanzine-like form, absolutely. And maybe that's what the nominated fancasts are doing. But at that point, you're basically doing an audiobook fanzine, which is a fine thing in and of itself, but not what I'd normally think of a podcast.<br /><br />So fancast (podcast+video versions) being separated from text (fanzine) makes sense to me.<br /><br />Now, semi-prozine, yeah, I've never really understood that, particularly not in the earlier versions of the award. I actually think the one that's used now (mostly paid distribution vs. not) is more defendable in some ways than the old one (at least one person makes a living's worth of income at it) because I didn't see any meaningful difference between semi-pro and pro at that point. This one is at least definable.<br /><br />* I can't be the only fanzine editor to take her 'zine into international distribution to be able to afford to do it at all, can I? See, I had to get the per-copy cost down, you see, which meant going offset, which meant I needed to sell a lot more copies to reach that go-ahead point, which meant I needed to <em>sell</em> a bunch more copies, which meant suddenly I have agreements with Diamond and Capital City and a couple of other distributors, and, yeah, things got out of hand.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","below":21566611,"ctime":"May 1 2015, 03:40:13 UTC","parent":21556371,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://solarbird.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"solarbird","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"solarbird","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://solarbird.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"solarbird","ctime_ts":1430451613,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21566611#t21566611","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21566611#t21566611","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21566611#t21566611","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bovil","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bovil.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21566611,"talkid":84244,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21566611#t21566611","above":21566355,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","parent":21556371,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bovil.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bovil","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bovil","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bovil.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bovil","ctime_ts":1430451865,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/20014792/4571008","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21562259#t21562259","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21562259#t21562259","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21562259#t21562259","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"querldox","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://querldox.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21562259,"talkid":84227,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425363.html?thread=21562259#t21562259","upictitle":"querldox: Class photo","article":"George, I have to at least somewhat disagree with you about Locus. Certainly by the time Locus was kicked out of semi-prozine, there was nothing \"semi\" about it and hadn't been for years. It was how at least one person made their living, had paid employees, and a full-fledged rate card. The only non-\"professional\" thing about it was that, with respect to the Hugos, \"professional\" almost always referred to fiction and publication in magazines and books devoted to fiction. I can't speak to when semi-prozine was established as a category, but clearly at some point during Locus' run there or before, it went from the standard \"sticky quarters for a copy\" to being sold on newsstands (OK, a relatively limited set of same, but it was being professionally distributed), which to me would've kicked it out of fanzine at least at the time.<br /><br />It's similar to how I had to vote the very talented Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd, below No Award the two or so times he was nominated in Fan Artist. Clearly, he and xkcd started off as fan art, albeit published online rather than in a fanzine. But by the time he was nominated, xkcd was how he supported himself, albeit somewhat more indirectly than by selling art to prozines and for book covers. And no one could point to any non-xkcd art they were nominating him for.
