{"itemid":842,"subject":"From Spain","event":"I've received a nice email from Canal+, who are airing GAME OF THRONES in Spain.\r\n\r\nThey write:\r\n\r\n================================\r\n\"... We aired yesterday the first episode of Game of Thrones.\r\n\r\nIt was a great success, it was one of the best series première for us.\r\n\r\nWe have prepared online material to support the series.\r\n\r\nHere, you can find an interactive map of Westeros and the Free Cities: http://www.canalplus.es/conoceponiente. \r\n\r\nIt will show the changes in the location of the characters with each episode.\r\n\r\nHere, you can find a game called Grito de Guerra (in English it would be War Call) The main theme of the game is to be a major Lord, and you  have a Maester on your service. Just after each episode, a new challenge appears on the web - the Lord has to direct his Maester to success in the challenge. Also, participants fight each other and follow the developments of the game, as well as create new rules on Twitter, @gritoguerra. \r\n\r\nYou can see it here: http://www.canalplus.es/gritodeguerra. \"\r\n\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nI hope my Spanish fans are enjoying the show, and it's great to see all that Canal + is doing to support the series over there.\r\n\r\nAnd as long as I'm talking about Spain, this is as good a time as any to mention that Parris and I will be heading back over to Gijon in 2012, for what will doubtless be another wonderful Semana Negra.","ditemid":215722,"eventtime":"2011-05-15 17:08:00","props":{"taglist":"conventions, spain, game of thrones","current_moodid":99,"commentalter":1335990646,"picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-05-15 23:10:26","anum":170,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html","event_timestamp":1305479280,"reply_count":37,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/4969975/815853","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?replyto=13486762","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13486762#t13486762","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13486762#t13486762","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13486762#t13486762","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13486762#t13486762","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"oosabeansaladen","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://oosabeansaladen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13486762,"talkid":52682,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13486762#t13486762","upictitle":"voidmind: mask","article":"Their interactive map is really impressive.

I got hooked immediately, read voraciously until 2006, and that was it....<br /><br />...and now The Song is back with a vengeance. You've gotten here with zero marketing or advertising, just pure word of mouth. One person tells another who tells another, and almost everybody agrees the the books are awesome so it keeps expanding its audience. Many people who may have read the books loooong ago are excited because of the series. It will hook people back.<br /><br /><br />And I say it's a dream come true, because it could've been a disaster like that Atlas Shrugged movie, or some kind of \"Xena and King Arthur meet in Westeros\" or something like that. But HBO has stayed true to the story. Canal+ is also doing a fantastic job, sadly it's a paid channel so not many people have it in Spain but the series is also coming to Nitro which is free.<br /><br />All I can say is, thank you Martin.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 16 2011, 00:00:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hell yeah","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000840808927","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Alberto Zaragoza","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_556518","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=37999266&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Alberto Zaragoza","ctime_ts":1305504041,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109997426/4331674","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?replyto=13487530","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487530#t13487530","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487530#t13487530","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487530#t13487530","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rvillarrubia","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rvillarrubia.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13487530,"talkid":52685,"etime_ts":"1305505536","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487530#t13487530","upictitle":"Ruth: ASOIAF ~ Wrong but Hot","article":"If any of you want to play \"Grito de Guerra\" let me know and I'll invite you!! :D","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 16 2011, 00:25:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rvillarrubia.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rvillarrubia","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rvillarrubia","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rvillarrubia.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"May 16 2011, 00:25:36 UTC","dname":"rvillarrubia","ctime_ts":1305505508,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109303944/36450372","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?replyto=13487786","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487786#t13487786","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487786#t13487786","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487786#t13487786","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_472692","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1037574153","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13487786,"talkid":52686,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/215722.html?thread=13487786#t13487786","upictitle":"Charles Velasco: pic#109303944","article":"Heading to spain??!?!?
