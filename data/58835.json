It's going to be a tough road to the playoffs and the division itself is almost certainly going to the Giants but...anything is possible in this league.

Mine, sadly to say is that of the Lions.  0-10.  I'm able to counter with the Pistons or my favorite - the Red Wings but I do enjoy watching football most.  Barry football of the 90's but we can't live in the past.  <br />LA has no home love.  Kobe this Kobe that.  Dodgers can't buy a World Series.  And Kings?... riiiight.  And of course there's either the Raiders forever losing under crazy Al or the Chargers and LT \"gee I wonder where the ball is going this down?\"  We'll never be a football town.  The Colleseum of USC is horrid and Pasadena will forever vote against having back to back football days - UCLA and sunday NFL.  Staples center has 19 pro teams already vying for space.  So that's my rant from Hollywoodland.
