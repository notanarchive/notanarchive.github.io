{"itemid":553,"subject":"Health Care at Last","event":"I watched the House pass the health care bill earlier tonight.  The talking heads all claimed it had the votes to pass, but I still found myself a case of nerves as the numbers piled up oh-so-slowly.  The feeling of relief when the count hit 216 was palpable.\r\n\r\nA great night for Obama, for the Democrats, for America.\r\n\r\nIs it a perfect piece of legislation?  By no means.  It's deeply flawed.  What we really need in this country is a single payer system, like Canada and Australia.  Failing that, a viable public option.  But the political realities being what they are, we could not get either of them.  This small, hesitant, deeply flawed bill is nonetheless an important first step on the road that will, one hopes, eventually take this country to where the rest of the western democracies arrived several generations ago.  \r\n\r\nPelosi and Obama both spoke about politics being personal.  So true, especially where health care is concerned.  Let me tell you a few of my own experiences.\r\n\r\nI've been a full-time freelance writer since 1979, and I've been fortunate enough to do very well at it, thank you.  As a result, I have health insurance.  But even for me, it hasn't been easy.  I remember, when I first moved to Santa Fe and went full time as a writer, I was coming off three years teaching college, when my health insurance had been covered by my job.  Now I had to find my own.  I was young and healthy back then... even slim and fit, believe it or not... but I didn't have a lot of money, and when I went looking for an individual policy, everything I found cost way more than I could afford and covered way less than my group insurance with the college had.  To get affordable insurance, I had to join a group: the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce.  As a \"small business,\" I joined the CofC and signed up for their group coverage.  It was not great insurance, by any means, but it gave me some protection for a few years.  But that was in 1980 or so.  In a more recent decade, when the Writer's Guild policy that had covered me during my Hollywood years expired, I tried the same dodge... only to discover that while I could still join the Chamber of Commerce as a sole proprietorship, I could no longer get their health insurance.  That was now available only to members who had two full-time employees.  The insurance company had... you guessed it... changed the rules.\r\n\r\nFrom 1997-1998 I served as vice-president of SFWA, the Science Fiction Writers of America, in the administration of Michael Capobianco, one of SFWA's most outstanding leaders.  A LOT of freelance writers had no health insurance, and Capo did what no other president before him had been able to do: find a decent, affordable group policy for SFWA members.  It was through Aetna, and while it wasn't as good as some other policies -- the WGA policy was much better --it was good enough, and certainly both cheaper and better than anything any writer could find as an individual.  I signed up, as did a couple hundred other SFWAns, and for a couple of years we had the peace of mind that having such insurance brings.  \r\n\r\nAnd then Aetna dropped us.  No particular reason was ever given.  Guess we weren't profitable enough for them.  They just cancelled the entire group.  That wasn't allowed in New York State, where state laws required them to continue insuring policy holders resident in that state.  But those of us in the other forty-nine states were out of luck.  Nor were SFWA's officers (Capo and I were out of office by that time) able to find ANY other insurance company willing to step in and take Aetna's place.  We were a group with fourteen hundred members, a couple hundred of whom had showed themselves willing and able to purchase group insurance (the rest, presumably, had policies from day jobs or through spouses, or were unable to afford any insurance whatsover)... and yet no one would insure us.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I am one of the lucky ones.  I was able to go back to the WGA for a few years, and from them to COBRA, and thanks to our state laws in New Mexico, I could purchase insurance through the New Mexico Health Insurance Alliance coming off COBRA without fear of being refused for pre-existing conditions.  So I'm covered.\r\n\r\nBut I have a lot of friends who are not nearly so fortunate.\r\n\r\nMany of you reading this blog today are presumably science fiction and fantasy fans.  It would probably shock you to know how many of your favorite writers have no health insurance whatsover.  Most midlist writers struggle to get by even at the best of times; lean times can be lean indeed.  For a self-employed individual, even one who can afford the premiums, insurance can be very hard to find and obscenely expensive when you do find it... and god help you if you have a pre-existing condition, because the insurance companies sure won't.\r\n\r\nThis has all been brought home to me forcefully these past few years.  A couple years back, one of my dearest friends, a great writer and a great guy, almost died of a heart attack.  He had to have a quintuple bypass, and had a very difficult time recovering from it.  No insurance.  No money, either.  Only the fact that he was a veteran saved him.  He was able to get help from the VA.  More recently, another old friend of mine got sick.  Another fine writer, natch.  No insurance, natch.  No money, natch.  Like the first friend, like a LOT of writers, he was just getting by.  So when he started feeling sick he did not go to see a doc, no.  Couldn't afford it.  Took over the counter stuff, rested at home, drank liquids, got sicker and sicker.  Finally went to the hospital, where he almost died.  Two surgeries and three weeks later, he's finally been discharged.  He's not a veteran, so the VA won't he coming to the rescue here.  His surgeries, his ICU stay, those three weeks in the hospital, they will doubtless add up to about ten years of his annual earnings.  Maybe more.  He's going to face bankruptcy.  \"Well, he should have had insurance,\" I can hear some right wing asshole out there saying.  Yeah, he shoulda.  Except, even if he'd had the money to buy a policy, no insurance company would ever have issued one for him.  He's had a pre-existing condition since childhood.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that if either of my friends had lived in Canada, or Australia, or France, or England, or any country with that old vile \"socialized medicine\" the right wing likes to denounce, they would never have gotten so sick.  They would have seen a doctor much earlier, early enough so that their medical problems could have been diagnosed, treated, and perhaps cured or ameliorated before they required major surgery.  But no, they couldn't afford doctors, and they didn't feel THAT bad... not at first... so they did what millions of Americans have done, and ignored their symptoms until it was almost too late.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I was thrilled by what I witnessed tonight.  This is something this country desperately needs.  Health care is a basic human right, something every other major western democracy recognized decades ago.  \r\n\r\nNow I just hope the Senate does not screw it up.\r\n\r\nOne last thing.  I think the extreme polarization of contemporary politics is both unfortunate and frightening (read some history of the Third Republic if you want to learn where such extremism can lead).  Obama's efforts to reach across the aisle and make these reforms bi-partisan may have been fruitless, even misguided, but they were also heroic.  And the utter rejection of those efforts by the GOP is both depressing and infuriating.  I have been a Democrat more often than I have been a Republican in my life, sure, but the Republican Party that I grew up with, the party of Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt (the first president to propose a national health program), of Clifford Case and Nelson Rockefeller, of Everett Dirksen and John Lindsay and Chuck Percy and Dwight D. Eisenhower... that party is now dead, it has become clear.  The nasty campaign of fear and misinformation and outright lies that the right has waged against \"Obamacare,\" complete with odious comparisons to Hitler (!) certainly drove that point home... though perhaps one might cling to some hope that those people were just the lunatic fringe.  \r\n\r\nBut no.  The fact that NOT ONE SINGLE REPUBLICAN voted against the party line is damning (more than thirty Democrats crossed the other way, by comparison).  Today's GOP has abandoned all pretense of serving the people or attempting to redress the country's problems.  Today's GOP belongs to the religious fundamentalists, the loonies and the haters, the lobbyists for the banks and corporations, and the very military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned against in his farewell speech.  They proved that tonight.  \r\n\r\nShame on them.","ditemid":141683,"eventtime":"2010-03-22 00:30:00","props":{"taglist":"politics","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1359075961,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":1565,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:16,18:12,10:16,11:3,23:5,36:11,16:16,3:23,4:8,19:13,9:28,21:2,nterms:no","revnum":3,"interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"revtime":1269381541},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-03-22 06:30:50","anum":115,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html","event_timestamp":1269217800,"reply_count":420,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98864820/34056","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250675#t9250675","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250675#t9250675","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250675#t9250675","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"amai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://amai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9250675,"talkid":36135,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250675#t9250675","upictitle":"amai: foxy","article":":) I'm so happy, finally a step forward!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 22 2010, 06:40:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://amai.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"amai","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"amai","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://amai.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"amai","ctime_ts":1269240038,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114869969/5668286","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250931#t9250931","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250931#t9250931","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250931#t9250931","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"paganpaul","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://paganpaul.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9250931,"talkid":36136,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9250931#t9250931","upictitle":"Paul: Ik","article":"I heard the news of the US health care bill on the radio this morning (Europe).

This will push us towards a Global government one more step.  <br /><br />Considering I just watched a terrific German-made film, 'The Lives of Others', just last night, which shows in stark terms how life was in Eastern Germany before The Wall came down, I am disgusted by what I see happening in this country.  The will of the PEOPLE was ignored.  The vast majority of Americans came down against this bill and the Democrats ignored their constituents in every case.<br /><br />I respect your opinion, George, but as much as I hate to say it, you're dead wrong on this.  The Bill should have been scrapped and a better solution found. If this Congress truly cared so much about doing the business of America, they would reign in Insurance companies, trial lawyers and the like that are the true source of grossly inflated healthcare costs.  But no, as usual the real parasites bought our corrupt politicians and will end up coming out of this even richer.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that for the first time in U.S. history, Congress has promoted a bill that will mandate what Americans must PAY for.  This is completely anti-Constitutional, and this makes the  vote an act of treason as far as I can see.<br /><br />So, we the People will pay even more to provide Healthcare for 30+ million Americans and ultimately another 30+ million illegal aliens.

I find it shocking that there is no recourse for people in the States who can't afford basic medical treatment.

But, despite all that, people can even receive government-funded treatment, even for cancer, if they are willing to wait to see a doctor.

I have insurance, but it's quite expensive (though far less than in the States), and the great majority of the population relies on the public health-care system.

We're far from having a decent health-care system, but hell, infinitely better than in the US. <br /><br />I myself am a liberal (more to left to almost anyone here, I think), and that's why I can only laugh at some comments such as \"This opens the door to pure Socialism, which I firmly believe is the intent of the bill and especially of Obama and his handlers. This will push us towards a Global government one more step\". \"The Lives of Others\" is a fantastic film - but thankfully the US is very, very far from Eastern Germany prior-1989.

Raeder: pic#98026269","article":"Mr. Martin, well-said. Thanks for speaking out about this.<br /><br />You accurately describe the uncertainty and fear that millions of self-employed workers, freelancers, and independent contractors experience on a daily basis in this country.<br /><br />My household consists of one freelancer (me) and one part-time hourly laborer. Neither of us can afford comprehensive health insurance. The plans that are aimed at people like us offer such meager \"coverage\" that there is little point for us to be on them.<br /><br />We're lucky to live in a city with a decent public hospital that will see patients free of charge (after getting on waiting lists and sitting in waiting rooms for entire days--nearly impossible to do if you work full-time), but it's something we only use in emergency situations.<br /><br />We don't go for regular check-ups. We deal with mysterious pains and symptoms, using the internet to self-diagnose and basically crossing our fingers that health care in the US will change before we get too old for any major illnesses to develop. Both of us have problems and risk factors in our family medical histories that we should be screened for. I constantly hope that luck will be on our side. I don't want to wake up middle-aged someday when we've finally decided to offer single-payer health care, and be told that I have some illness that could have been caught years ago.<br /><br />I couldn't agree more with your assessment of the GOP's total dismissal of health care. Their threats of retaliation in the fall elections ring hollow: they've exposed themselves as out of touch with the reality of working- and middle-class people. I can't say that Democrats are much better, being generally just as corrupt and self-interested, but I do credit this success largely to Obama's tenacity and personal dedication.<br /><br />You're right: his plan is flawed and needs a lot of adjustment. But without a stubborn idealist refusing to give up, we would have never passed any sort of health care reform. This country's politics are frighteningly polarized, as you mentioned--we were content to go back and forth over the bill ad infinitum until someone stepped in and, like a parent, scolded us like children. It's pathetic that it had to be passed like this.<br /><br />The majority of developed capitalist nations offer single-payer health care. And they are still thriving. Their quality of living is higher than ours. Their infrastructure is better than ours. They haven't suddenly given up on capitalism and decided to reboot Communism. We're the ones with the economic crisis, the ones who spend one in six dollars on health care, the ones with the lowest life expectancies out of developed nations, the ones with soaring unemployment and overextended armies.<br /><br />It's about time we confronted the corrupt, bloated health care system that is wholly antithetical to the principles of the free market.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 22 2010, 07:20:20 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"This is reality for millions of self-employed workers and independent contractors.","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://leahraeder.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"leahraeder","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"leahraeder","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://leahraeder.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"leahraeder","ctime_ts":1269242420,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9282675#t9282675","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9282675#t9282675","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9282675#t9282675","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9282675#t9282675","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bnc929","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bnc929.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9282675,"talkid":36260,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9282675#t9282675","above":9255283,"upictitle":"bnc929: pic#0","article":"You haven't been watching the news if you don't think Europe is in an economic crisis.<br /><br />They are falling apart over there. Ireland, greece, spain, the UK, portugal, France, Iceland of course. Some of these countries might go bankrupt, like Argentina does every few years. <br /><br />Also, do you know what the average unemployement rate is in Europe, even in good times? What we consider bad unemployment they consider normal. <br /><br /><br />Also, do you really think life expectancy == healthcare? Do you not genetics and lifestyle choices have anything to do with it?<br /><br />Did you know if you factor out traffic accidents and homicides the US has some of the highest life expectancy in the world? Honest.<br /><br />Single payer is great if you never need life saving care. It does really good at routine care. But because of shortages it can't handle advanced lifesaving care. Which is why when looking at things like survival rates after diagnosis or a serious illness puts all those countries below us here. <br /><br />The fact is, healthcare is not an unlimited resource. Anymore than science fiction books are an unlimited resource or starbucks coffee is an unlimited resource. <br /><br />You can ration it by price, or you can ratio it by waiting, or by quality. You cannot magically wave a wand and have more MRI machines exist, more interventional cardiologists exist, more chemotherapy centers exist. Someone has to pay for all of that, it is a limited resource. Unless... of course.. you simply want to enslave everyone who works in the healthcare industry from people who manufacture medical equipment, to build hospitals, to doctors and nurses.... good luck motivating them to do good work if you enslave them. But assuming you don't want to go the communist route, then someone has to pay for it.<br /><br />The point is, if you want everyone to have coverage, then you need to increase waiting, decrease quality, or increase payments. Now you don't see any politicians talking about increasing medical reimbursements do you? So the 85% of people in the US with medical coverage should expect to end up seeing more waiting and less quality.<br /><br />Also, by the way, the US does not only spend on the rich. Statistically as a country we spend more per capita on healthcare for the poor, than the rich. Look it up. As I recall it is something like 9k per year vs 11k.<br /><br /><br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 22 2010, 12:10:28

As a long time fantasy and sci-fi reader, occassional writer, armchair political pundit and academic, it's just good to see an author whose political philosophy aligns with mine.  Not that I have to have people I agree with in this world, but the viewpoint of the author will always come through.  (I doubt Orson Scott Card could write a positive gay atheist pacifist character, for example.)<br /><br />Although authors are not their books, their views and values shape the sorts of worlds they create and the characters they present as negative and positive role models.

I really can't imagine it will ruin the country, or turn us socialist, but I am not quite sure how it will help us all either. From what I gather, and correct me if I am wrong, there is no public option, and healthcare won't be paid by taxes. But insurance WILL be required for everyone?

I make enough to get by paycheck to paycheck, with enough money to buy internet each month, but I don't have cable, live in an income controlled apartment, and I don't eat lavishly or dress trendily. If I was to buy into the insurance that my work provides, I would be going into debt each month easily, and to be honest, it covers next to nothing. Any rates Ive sought outside of that are abysmally terrible as well.<br /><br />So what I guess I am asking is, what WAS in the bill and how will it help? I am not opposed to it, but the idea of being forced to pay something I cannot afford doesn't really appeal to me.

I've been in your shoes, GRRM, as a small business owner myself. Our current health care system is designed with the 1950s in mind - people working for large corporations, getting their health care from a group pool. It's absolutely a nightmare for individuals and small business owners, as you say, unless you happen to be in perfect health (in which case, you really only need catastrophic coverage anyway).<br /><br />However, the current system incentivizes everything backwards. It is now optimal for healthy people to go without health insurance, perhaps with just catastrophic coverage, and then sign up when they get sick. Everyone else in your pool will pay for your illness, so people who have traditional insurance will end up paying more. While the current system supports the corporate employee at the expense of the small business owner, the new system reverses the exploitation.<br /><br />Some notes:<br /><br />1) About half of all the health care money in the US comes from the government, so the notion about socialized medicine is already half-true. If they opened up Medicare to everyone (paying in at cost so that it doesn't bankrupt the government) that could be an effective replacement for a single-payer system that doesn't destroy the advantages of our current health care system. Or it would, except I think a lot of hospitals are about to start dropping Medicare coverage entirely due to the cuts in the current bill. Medicare reform is desperately needed - it incentivizes doctors in paradoxical ways that are deleterious to patient care.<br /><br />2) Tort reform is necessary. Sorry, but John Edwards suing doctors because kids randomly get born with Cerebal Palsy does not make doctors better. It makes doctors quit the OB/GYN business, and hurts the general public. The Democrats are a party of lawyers, and the lawyers were the conspicuous winners from this bill. Malpractice insurance makes up a huge part of the cost of health care these days.<br /><br />3) Medicare Part D needs to be able to negotiate with drug companies for reduced prices. The VA does, which is one of the reasons they can stay afloat on a restricted budget. VA reform is necessary though, too - their computer systems are a babylonian nightmare.<br /><br />4) The way billing works in hospitals is more or less fraudulent. It works by inflating prices by 4x, offering a 75% discount to insurance companies (who essentially pay the original price), thus screwing over people that don't have insurance in order to cover losses from people that don't pay. You also can't tell how much something is going to cost before you pay for it, if you don't have insurance. When you remove the free market that far from a payer, it's no mistake that the billing system is so messed up.<br /><br />Ever been to an auto mechanic? They have a list of prices up on the wall - this much for an oil change, this much per hour for labor. We need a rule for hospitals for the same.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 22 2010, 08:20:06 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://shakauvm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"shakauvm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"shakauvm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://shakauvm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"shakauvm","ctime_ts":1269246006,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9331827#t9331827","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9331827#t9331827","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9331827#t9331827","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tstanton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tstanton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9331827,"talkid":36452,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/141683.html?thread=9331827#t9331827","above":9268339,"upictitle":"tstanton: pic#0","article":"The costs involved in tort reform are actually irrelevant, as far as I'm concerned, anyway.
