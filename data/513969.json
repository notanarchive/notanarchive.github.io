{"itemid":2007,"subject":"Survived Another Xmas","event":"Another Christmas has come and gone.  \r\n\r\nI have to admit, Halloween and Thanksgiving are my favorite holidays.  Christmas has always been too stressful, at least since I became an adult (a long long time ago).  But this year's was relatively mellow.  I spent it at home with Parris, friends, and cats, and a good time was had by all.\r\n\r\nThere <i><b>are</b></i> things I like about Christmas, though.  Watching Christmas movies, especially.  A CHRISTMAS STORY is a favorite, and I also like to binge watch all the various versions of the Dickens classic CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Alastair Sim, George C. Scott, Reginald Owen, Mickey Mouse, Albert Finney, Bill Murray... they all have their points, and it's fun to compare and contrast.  On balance, I still think the Sim is the best of the adaptations.  And when you cross over to the parody side of the ledger, there's nothing but nothing comes close to the Blackadder version.   \r\n\r\nThis year we also watched FOOTLIGHT PARADE, which has nothing to do with Christmas but is a fun film.  One of the last of the great pre-Code films, it's amazing to see how risque it is compared to what Hollywood would be making a year later and for decades to follow.  And the musical numbers are unforgettable, especially Cagney in \"Looking for My Shanghai Lil.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway... merry merry to all my friends, fans, and readers out there.   I hope Santa was good to you.  At least those of you who were nice.  As for those of you who were naughty.. come sit here next to me.","ditemid":513969,"eventtime":"2016-12-26 17:13:00","props":{"current_mood":"tired","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"everyday life, films","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Dec 27 00:13:02 2016]R [Tue Dec 27 00:13:03 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/813538144524128257 ","current_moodid":31,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1483131125,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/813538144524128257","reading_time":2,"ratingbot_comment":"[cyr:-|ua:-|noncyr:22|by:-|ru:-|rureg:-]","picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.652684995724557]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1482797987}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2007?v=1483136500","revtime":1483136498},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-27 00:13:00","anum":177,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513969.html","event_timestamp":1482772380,"reply_count":35,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513969.html?thread=25455537#t25455537","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513969.html?thread=25455537#t25455537","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513969.html?thread=25455537#t25455537","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3948395","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/110392176070465421858","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25455537,"talkid":99435,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/513969.html?thread=25455537#t25455537","upictitle":"brunopomaro: pic#0","article":"Merry Christmas to you and your family, Mr. Martin.
