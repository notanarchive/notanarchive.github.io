{"itemid":1760,"subject":"Coming to the Cocteau","event":"We have some great stuff coming to the Jean Cocteau Cinema in the weeks to come.\r\n\r\nStarting this weekend, when we'll be showing the classic BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"617\"/>\r\n\r\nCome Tuesday, we'll have another author event, this time featuring... yes, ME.\r\n\r\nA KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS came out October 6 and has been riding high on the lists.  And Tuesday October 27 is the official release date for both Bantam's official ICE AND FIRE adult coloring book, and Tor's reissue of Wild Cards volume five, DOWN & DIRTY.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/299547/299547_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/299880/299880_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/300174/300174_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nAll three titles will be available for sale at the JCC.  MELINDA SNODGRASS will be on hand as well, to interview me.  A question-and-answer will follow, and then I will adjourn to the lobby to sign books (but no personalizations, sorry).  However, tickets are already half-gone for this one, and we anticipate another sellout... so if you want to join us, contact the theatre (by phone or via our website) and reserve a book and a place now.\r\n\r\nCome Halloween weekened, we'll be showing something old and something new... ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (with a live performance by Rocky Horror New Mexico) and THE CREEPING GARDEN, a film about... wait for it... SLIME MOLD.  (Where else but the JCC?)\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"618\"/>\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"619\"/>\r\n\r\nTickets to all of these events can be bought on the JCC website: http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/\r\n\r\nNovember is looking pretty cool as well, with author events coming up for DEBORAH HARKNESS and the WHEEL OF TIME COMPANION, and burlesque with the SUICIDE GIRLS.\r\n\r\nSee you at the Cocteau!","ditemid":450724,"eventtime":"2015-10-22 13:10:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, signings, signed books, movie theatre","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1446146391,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Coming to the Cocteau http://goo.gl/8vxSfb","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.670788970090797]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1445541052}","revtime":1447096647},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-10-22 19:10:06","anum":164,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/450724.html","event_timestamp":1445519400,"reply_count":5,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124842061/75273374","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/450724.html?thread=22916516#t22916516","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/450724.html?thread=22916516#t22916516","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/450724.html?thread=22916516#t22916516","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3111149","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/102746494923227506916","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22916516,"talkid":89517,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/450724.html?thread=22916516#t22916516","upictitle":"John Nelson: pic#124842061","article":"I see it's going to be like Halloween town there at camp George with classic horror, your Q&A and Rocky.

Mom was the kind of person Frankenstein's monster would have run from in fear, but as a child he scared her out of her wits and made her cry. She said she had nightmares for months after that. <br /><br />Monsters brought to life by the likes of Boris Karloff in an age where the Great Depression held sway were frightening to the people and they were innocent of the kinds of monsters we create daily in every medium, yet it is funny and a little sad that we have lost the kind of innocence that found <i>Frankenstein</i> terrifying, which puts me in mind of <i>The Exorcist</i> when it hit the theaters with tales of women fainting in the aisles and giving premature birth. I remember how my girlfriend and I checked the car thoroughly, including underneath it, before we would get inside after seeing the movie. Now we take the horrifying monsters, ghouls, and foulest creatures computers and the human mind conjure without blinking or even a half gasp.
