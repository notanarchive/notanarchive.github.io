Next spring sounds perfect. Thanks for all the new updates, it really increases my interest and joy for this trip. I always love my trips to Santa FE, but you have amped my visit schedule 1000%. This trip will be special. Thanks!!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 15 2015, 15:20:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Robot","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://arya-wolf.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"arya_wolf","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"arya_wolf","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://arya-wolf.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"arya_wolf","ctime_ts":1444922458,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/449525.html?thread=22867445#t22867445","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/449525.html?thread=22867445#t22867445","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/449525.html?thread=22867445#t22867445","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3344568","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/114700330412067771024","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22867445,"talkid":89325,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/449525.html?thread=22867445#t22867445","upictitle":"Barbara Szeląg: pic#0","article":"Now, as I am going through 'The Armageddon Rag', I’ve just realised that it is your last novel I hadn’t read yet.<br />Which makes me simultaneously fulfilled and terrified.
