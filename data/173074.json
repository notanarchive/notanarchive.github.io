He's met his waterloo and been a casualty, and seen his share of apparitions too.\"\r\n\r\nThe bloody lash is Jhogo, one of Dany's bloodriders.  He's the one she gives the whip too.  In the series, he will be played by Londoner ELYES GABEL.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000chxcz/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000chxcz/s320x240\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nGabel played Rob Cleaver in WATERLOO ROAD, 'Guppy' Sandhu in CASUALTY, and Vimal in APPARITIONS.  In DEAD SET his character becomes a zombie, so he knows what it is like to be dead.  You'll enjoy watching him as Dany's whip man.  It is known.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000cqdh0/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000cqdh0\" width=\"158\" height=\"201\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n(And for those of you who are keeping score, Dany's other bloodriders will be played by extras or featured extras, at least in season one).\r\n\r\n\"The horny-headed hammerhand is older than you might have thought, but too young to need a pacemaker, though he might have ridden on the ferry with Gerry. Another friend of our kraken's sister, he knows the doctor and the wizard too. Damned if he doesn't play what he calls football (not the real kind).\"\r\n\r\nYou got this one very fast.  Yes, the horny-headed hammerhand is Gendry, the armorer's apprenctice, who fashions a horned helm for himself, and is told that his hands were made for hammers.  Portraying him in the series will be JOE DEMPSIE.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ck4q5/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ck4q5/s320x240\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nYes, Dempsie is considerably older than Gendry in the books.  David & Dan decided to age up the character, as with many of the children in the books (Robb, Jon, Dany, etc).  Dempsie hails from Liverpool, on the Mersey, which is why you will find those references to Gerry and the Pacemakers in the clues (though he's still so young I doubt he knows who Gerry and the Pacemakers were).  He's played in MERLIN and DOCTOR WHO, so he knows the wizard and the doctor, though he's perhaps best known for his role as Chris in SKINS.  He's been on LILY ALLEN AND FRIENDS, and he was in THE DAMNED UNITED, a soccer movie.  That's \"football\" for those parts of the world that don't know True Football.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000cpw1q/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000cpw1q/s320x240\" width=\"189\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nSo... two more bright young talents come to Westeros.

Now on to the pointless (in good humour) diatribe.<br /><br />I know you have a bias towards pig skin, but to call it \"True Football\" is somewhat silly. Face it George, they named the sport incorrectly.<br /><br />American Football features players mostly running with, or throwing a oval shaped \"ball\" and the rare kick.<br /><br />What the rest of the world knows as Football (and North Americans as Soccer) involves players running around kicking a round ball (actually a truncated icosahedron, but definitely better fits teh description of a ball) and rarely handling the ball (although a little more often where the goalkeeper is concerned).<br /><br />Football/Soccer has the clear advantage over American \"football\" to be the \"true Football\": in 3 catagories.<br /><br />1) Football/Soccer existed first and could claim the name \"true football\" on that alone.<br />2) Football/Soccer clearly involves the feet of players much more frequently for kicking the ball. (hence the FOOT in FOOTball.<br />3) Football/Soccer has a more ball shaped ball. (Hence the BALL in footBALL).<br /><br />Well George, you are a smart guy, but you love your Football, and like most Men like us over the age of 12, are set in our ways.
