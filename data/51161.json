Many read both, however, so I'll just briefly mention that Green Ronin has released its new Wild Cards role-playing game.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00012p5q/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00012p5q/s320x240\" width=\"185\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe campaign setting book, lavishly illustrated in full color, was written by John Jos. Miller, and should be available soon at a game store near you.  It's a great resource for any Wild Cards fan, even if you don't game.
