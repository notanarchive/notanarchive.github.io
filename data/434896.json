GAME OF THRONES is what it is because of the untiring efforts of the best cast and crew in television today.  Many were recognized by the Academy today for their work... but others, equally dedicated and talented, were not.  But the show would not the hit it is without their talent and dedication.  \r\n\r\nThe 24 nominations garnered by GAME OF THRONES is not only the highest number of any show this year, but among the highest ever received by a single series for a single season in the entire history of television.  (For numbers geeks, the record remains 27, garnered by <i><b><i><b>NYPD BLUE</b></i></b></i> in 1994).\r\n\r\nToday is a day for celebrations and congratulations, for popping champagne corks and raising toasts and exchanging thanks... but before we do too many cartwheels, it would be wise to remember that GAME OF THRONES also led the Emmy nominations last year, with 19 nods, only to get skunked on the night of the televised awards.  The same as the year before, and the year before that.  Like many fantasy shows before us, GOT is often honored for our special effects, costumes, makeup, stuntwork, set design, and cinematography (this year, please note, we have four of five finalists for cinematography), but seldom for writing, directing, or acting.  Peter Dinklage's Emmy as Best Supporting Actor for season one remains the ONLY award the show has ever won in those categories, in fact.  \r\n\r\nWill that change this year?  One can hope, I suppose.\r\n\r\nBut no matter what happens on Emmy Night, let me say once again that it truly is an honor to be nominated, especially given the competition.  This truly is The Golden Age of Television, especially for drama.  GAME OF THRONES faces the usual formidable competition for the \"Big One,\" the award for Best Dramatic Series... but as distinguished a list as that is, there are so many incredible shows that did NOT make the cut that it boggles the mind.  It's great to see BETTER CALL SAUL and ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK on this list, but where is MASTERS OF SEX?  THE KNICK?  HALT AND CATCH FIRE?  How about THE VIKINGS?  I really thought JUSTIFIED might make it, for its final season. And OUTLANDER, how in the world did they overlook OUTLANDER, with its music and its costumes and its cinematography and the incredible performances of its three leads (especially Tobias Menzies in his double role)?  Why is Nick Offermann not on the ballot for PARKS AND RECREATION?  How could BIG BANG THEORY possibly fall off?  Truly, the Academy (of which I am a member) moves in mysterious ways.\r\n\r\nEven where GOT itself is concerned... I am thrilled to see both Emilia Clarke and Lena Headey among the nominees, but I wanted Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner and Natalie Dormer as well... it's great that two of our episodes got nominated for directing, but how did they overlook \"Hardhome?\"... and will Iain Glen and Conleth Hill and John Bradley West ever get any recognition, and... \r\n\r\nOkay, okay, I know, I am being greedy, and every producer on every other show on television is probably saying the same things about his own cast just now.  Let me just savor the moment.  \r\n\r\nGOT did good.","ditemid":434896,"eventtime":"2015-07-16 16:30:00","props":{"current_mood":"impressed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"emmy awards, awards, television, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":116,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1438110267,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Emmy Likes Us http://goo.gl/ucq3Kx","picture_keyword":"greyjoy","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.606466193312016]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1437085831}","revtime":1438198755},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-16 22:29:35","anum":208,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html","event_timestamp":1437064200,"reply_count":78,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125225417/76490462","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22064080#t22064080","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22064080#t22064080","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22064080#t22064080","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3230125","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/avadaK89","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22064080,"talkid":86187,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22064080#t22064080","upictitle":"matt morey: pic#125225417","article":"Everyone involved in GoT is absolutely amazing.

How was it snubbed for House of Cards which had an awful third season? Also, Sam Heughan provided some of the most emotionally devastating scenes that I've ever witnessed on TV in the last few episode of Outlander and he was snubbed. The Americans being snubbed is also just down right ridiculous. <br /><br />As much as you may feel pleased that GoT won so many awards, the snubs and over dominance of particular tv shows and actors shows how redundant these award ceremonies are becoming. I'm glad the Academy seemed to wake up to the perception of the general public and get a nomination in for Tatiana Maslany but that's like a splash of a pebble in an ocean. <br /><br />I don't think GoT will get the recognition it deserves from these award ceremonies, and the biggest crime of the whole process is that Daredevil didn't get nominated. That is a tour de force in pushing the boundaries of television to the extreme, but because it's a comic book adaption the Academy look down on it. Each year I'm becoming more and more disillusioned by these archaic ceremonies.

I think Lena has the best chance, she was great this season. <br /><br />Also, interesting that you gave a specific nod to Hardhome, given it featured one of the biggest departures from the show yet. After a controversial season where book readers disliked a hell of a lot of the changes, I haven't seen anyone dislike Hardhome. A shame it didn't get recognition, given that it's most peoples' favourite episode of the season.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 17 2015, 01:16:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/mrwho995","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mrwho995","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3230184","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76491126&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"mrwho995","ctime_ts":1437095768,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125225661/76491224","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22072784#t22072784","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22072784#t22072784","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22072784#t22072784","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3230198","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/a_mtnez","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22072784,"talkid":86221,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434896.html?thread=22072784#t22072784","upictitle":"Alex Martnez: pic#125225661","article":"I agree with you, Game of Thrones deserves at least to win a writing or directing award.<br /><br />Maybe the show is too ahead of its time for the Academy (I'm just thinking of The Wire...).<br /><br /><br />PS: I'm a new fan of the books, I started reading after watching the series and I'm really enjoying them.
