Granted, I am biased as a Pats fan, and there was a couple day stretch where I thought they did it, until the information became a bit clearer.<br /><br />First of all, the initial report of a 2 psi difference was exaggerated.  It was closer to 1 psi.  Second, the weather conditions can very easily(and in fact they MUST) affect the air pressure inside the balls.  Those particular conditions would drop the psi from between .7 and 1.5 psi!  Thirdly, when Brady says he couldn't tell the difference, you can tell the difference between a 12.5 psi and an 11.5 psi ball... when you have them both in a hand at the same time and those hands are dry and warm.  However, I doubt most people would notice a difference and if they did on a subconscious level they would probably attribute it to the fact that their hands are numb.<br /><br />The reality is that the actual EVIDENCE does not show the Pats did anything wrong.  Do I know for a fact, no, but I still demand proof beyond reasonable doubt.

Hogans Heroes was my favourite series until I heard that Wild Cards was picked up by SyFy.  Already it is my go to show even though it hasn't aired yet.  Keep on posting about the NFL because your concise and informative blogs are very educating for a hard working stiff like me.  I don't get the opportunity to watch NFL, being so busy, so I need all the help I can to learn about this great sport.  <br /><br />Pats cheated, I just know it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 28 2015, 01:30:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lowballjets.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lowballjets","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lowballjets","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lowballjets.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lowballjets","ctime_ts":1422408649,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121403519/49487085","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?replyto=20180264","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20180264#t20180264","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20180264#t20180264","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20180264#t20180264","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1208390","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/rayfeighery","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20180264,"talkid":78829,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20180264#t20180264","upictitle":"Ray Feighery: pic#121403519","article":"Not surprisingly the latest is that the league now admits that while they originally said the officials use a pressure gauge that is not always the case and they frequently just feel the ball.<br /><br />As I expected it's going to come down to the officials messed up but rather than just admit that they have to ry to find a scapegoat first.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 28 2015, 02:24:06 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/rayfeighery","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Ray Feighery","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1208390","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=49487085&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Ray Feighery","ctime_ts":1422411846,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124370004/73608496","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?replyto=20188968","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20188968#t20188968","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20188968#t20188968","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20188968#t20188968","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2927440","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/lindsay.went","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20188968,"talkid":78863,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/404264.html?thread=20188968#t20188968","upictitle":"Lindsay Went: pic#124370004","article":"I'm an Australian and I don't know a lot about NFL history.
