That is to say, I loved the reboot series so far-but this one is an entirely different beast!<br /><br />I prefer to talk technically, because as much as I am dying to discuss plot stuff-I *know* I was the first person to get this at our local library, and therefore I figure hardly anybody else has completed it yet!<br /><br />Whatever you and the authors did on this book, George, the darn thing reads and feels more like a very fast paced techno-thriller or mystery or thriller action mystery-it feels like a new genre.<br /><br />Or more specifically, without resorting to fanboy hyperbole-it was utterly seamless in how fluidly the the massive cast of characters came together so inevitably and page-turningly (that is one annoying adjective/adverb).<br /><br />I am by all accounts an extremely fast reader, but this new book made me want to slow down-because I was gobbling it up *too fast*-I had to take a break.<br /><br />But then I couldn't stop!<br /><br />It really felt like there was a plan all along, that it was a trilogy, and that it really, really had a climax that I didn't foresee...<br /><br />I'm still flabbergasted-half the time, as a wannabe editor, I kept wanting to take notes as it went along to see who or what wrote what, and I'm still amazed that there are no real obvious cues!<br /><br />When I say pot-boiler or techno thriller-that is a heartfelt compliment: The plotting was *dense*-the cast of characters was Huge!<br /><br />Ok- I'm going to sign off now, because without talking specifics, at times I swore to myself that I could not believe there was more than one author on this book.<br /><br />And that author maybe wasn't George RR Martin...there were too many girlish cues/insights that made me say-no guy could have written this.<br /><br />I'm amazed-the conceit of the day to day timeline *might* have done it, somehow-but the plots as they come together gave me a very visceral and emotional response.<br /><br />More than any WC book ever-good job George and Crew!<br /><br />I'm gonna have a sip of beer for Victor Milan specifically!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"January 20 2010, 08:05:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"No Spoilers-I just finished reading Suicide Kings-It was great!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lordbronco.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lordbronco","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lordbronco","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lordbronco.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lordbronco","ctime_ts":1263974743,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/128121.html?replyto=8356473","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/128121.html?thread=8356473#t8356473","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/128121.html?thread=8356473#t8356473","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/128121.html?thread=8356473#t8356473","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8356473,"talkid":32642,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/128121.html?thread=8356473#t8356473","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Many thanks to Dan for that post.
