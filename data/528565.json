{"itemid":2064,"subject":"Magic Times Three","event":"If you're a fan of magic, we have some great shows in store for you these next few months, right here in <s>River City</s> Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nFirst up, at the Jean Cocteau, the amazing FRANCIS MENOTTI will be returning for three more shows.  Francis is the guy who stumped Penn & Teller, and he'll be performing the \"stumper\" for us as well, along with a host of other tricks, on Friday April 21 and Saturday, April 22.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"899\"/>\r\n\r\nNext up, all the way from Down Under, will be a pair of young Aussie lads who call themselves... yes... THE NAKED MAGICIANS!  The Jean Cocteau is co-sponsoring this one with the Lensic, since our stage is way too small (and way too close) to hold an act as... revealing... as the Naked Magicians.  The Lensic, with its big auditorium and huge stage, will do just fine.   \r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"900\"/>\r\n\r\nThe boys from down under will be in town for ONE PERFORMANCE ONLY on Tuesday, May 30.  For tickets, you will need to go to the Lensic website at http://tickets.ticketssantafe.org/single/EventDetail.aspx?p=3965\r\n\r\nLast, but far from least, one of our favorites returns to the Jean Cocteau for her third time:  MISTY LEE, straight from LA's famous Magic Castle.  Catch her at the JCC June 9-10, for three shows.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"901\"/>\r\n\r\nFor this visit, Misty has promised to STAB an audience member!  \r\n\r\nTickets for Misty Lee and Francis Menotti can be purchased from the Jean Cocteau Cinema website, at http://jeancocteaucinema.com/\r\n\r\nDon't miss you, or we'll turn you into a toad!","ditemid":528565,"eventtime":"2017-03-23 19:35:00","props":{"current_mood":"enthralled","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, magic","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Mar 21 01:35:10 2017]R [Tue Mar 21 01:35:11 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/843999395318325249 ","current_moodid":13,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1492274474,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/843999395318325249","picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.679623328423492]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1490060167}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2064?v=1491690344","revtime":1491690343},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-03-21 01:35:09","anum":181,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/528565.html","event_timestamp":1490297700,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126988931/80328214","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/528565.html?thread=25896629#t25896629","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/528565.html?thread=25896629#t25896629","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/528565.html?thread=25896629#t25896629","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3966624","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1124887310942332/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25896629,"talkid":101158,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/528565.html?thread=25896629#t25896629","upictitle":"Williamjames Hoffer: pic#126988931","article":"Terrific slate as usual.
