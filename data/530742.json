{"itemid":2073,"subject":"Hugo Ballot Announced","event":"That Finnish Worldcon has announced this year's finalists for the Hugo Awards.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/451219/451219_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/451479/451479_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/451716/451716_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/452059/452059_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/452227/452227_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nYou can hear the nominees announced by Finns, here:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"914\"/>\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could just go to LOCUS and read the list for yourself:\r\nhttp://www.locusmag.com/News/2017/04/12103/\r\n\r\nCongratulations to everyone who made the ballot, and condolences to those who didn't.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, this is the best ballot we've had in several years, mostly because the impact of the slates has ebbed somewhat.  Maybe it was EPH and the rules changes, or maybe they just got tired, but whatever the reason, not a single category this year was slated top to bottom.  Yeah, there are some finalists that are plainly unworthy... but there's real choice in every category, and I doubt that the halls of Helsinki will be resounding to the sound of \"No Award.\"  I haven't read everything that's on the ballot -- that's one of the things the Hugo ballot has traditionally been good for, it makes a great reading list -- and when I do, I probably won't like everything.  But I expect I will like <b><i>something </i></b>in every category, and that's all I really ask for.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm thrilled to see that two episodes of GAME OF THRONES were nominated in Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form: our two Emmy winners, as it happens, \"Battle of the Bastards\" and \"The Door.\"   I know David Benioff and Dan Weiss will be also been thrilled, along with our cast and crew and all the good people at HBO.  Helsinki is a lot closer to Belfast than the US, so there's even a chance that David and Dan might fly in for the ceremony (shooting schedule permitting), as they did for Loncon.  If they can't, the lovely Sibel Kekilli will help me represent GOT on the night, as Ron Donachie and Rory McCann did in prior years.   \r\n\r\nOf course, we face some hellacious tough competition.  \"Leviathan Wakes\" has also been nominated, the finale of season one of THE EXPANSE, along with \"San Junipero\" from BLACK MIRROR, my favorite episode from that terrific show.  And of course there's an episode of DR. WHO in there, as there always is, along with a sixth nominee that I'm unfamiliar with, as yet.  As it happens, there were <i><b>three </b></i>episodes of GAME OF THRONES that got enough votes to make the final ballot, but this year a new rule went into effect, limiting each series to no more than two nominees.  That's the <i><b>DR. WHO</b></i> rule.  It's been needed for years, and I'm glad to see it in place, but it's one of life's little ironies that the first show it bites is not <i><b>DR. WHO</b></i>, but <i><b>GAME OF THRONES</b></i>.  But one must not be greedy.  It <i><b>IS </b></i>an honor just to be nominated, and a double honor to be nominated twice, so thanks to all the fans out there who gave us one of their votes.\r\n\r\nThose who follow my Not A Blog regularly will know that I made recommendations in a number of different categories (though by no means all) during the nominating period.  Some of them made the cut, and some did not.  And that's fine, that's the way it goes, the way it <i><b>always</b></i> went before the advent of the slates.  You make your picks, and sometimes your fellow fans agree and sometimes they don't, and that's why it's a horse race.  Anyone who works in this field for long, as writer, artist, editor, or fan, will have their share of both celebrations and disappointments.  I certainly have.  But you know, you can even celebrate your disappointments; that's what the Hugo Losers Party is all about.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I will confess, I am very disappointed that WILD CARDS did not get a nod in the new Best Series category, it being our thirtieth anniversary and all. On the other hand, a number of my Wild Carders did very well.  In that same Best Series category, Jimmy Corey and Max Gladstone are both finalists, Carrie Vaughn got a nomination in Short Story, and the Newmans are nominated in Best Fancast.  No Alfie for them this year, they may have to make do with a Hugo.  Oh, and speaking of that, I was also pleased to see how many Alfie winners made the ballot.  Alyssa Wong has two nominations, Ursula Vernon is up in Short Story, Liz Gorinsky is nominated for Best Editor Long Form, John Joseph Adams for Best Editor Short Form, Julie Dillon for Best Pro Artist, and JOURNEY PLANET for Best Fanzine.   \r\n\r\nWhich reminds me, now that the ballot is out, one of the things I'm doing to have to ponder is whether or not I need to give out Alfies this year.   My first inclination is to say, hey, maybe not, doesn't look as though they're necessary.  But they were fun, so let me mull that a while.  I still have a lot of hood ornaments in the basement.\r\n\r\nOne thing I can say for sure about the Hugo Awards: this year, like every year, there will be more losers than winners.  Which means we'll need another Hugo Losers Party.   \r\n\r\nI do hope Robert Silverberg wins.  I would so look forward to seeing him in a conehead.","ditemid":530742,"eventtime":"2017-04-04 19:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"alfies, hugo awards, worldcon","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Apr  5 01:36:45 2017]R [Wed Apr  5 01:36:46 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/849435609823313924 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1492274249,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/849435609823313924","ratingbot_comment":"[cyr:-|ua:-|noncyr:25|by:-|ru:-|rureg:-]","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.684315427550997]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1491356224}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2073?v=1491691429","revtime":1491691425},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-04-05 01:36:42","anum":54,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html","event_timestamp":1491334560,"reply_count":49,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/99074515/12922271","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947446#t25947446","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947446#t25947446","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947446#t25947446","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"seyera","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://seyera.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25947446,"talkid":101357,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947446#t25947446","article":"Since Helsinki is unusual in the way that not all convention guests will be lodging at the convention center's adjunct hotel, I wonder how all the parties - room and otherwise - will work?","upictitle":"Seyera: Ariel","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"1 month ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"April 5 2017, 01:46:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://seyera.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"seyera","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"seyera","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://seyera.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"seyera","ctime_ts":1491356792,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947958#t25947958","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947958#t25947958","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947958#t25947958","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25947958,"talkid":101359,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/530742.html?thread=25947958#t25947958","above":25947446,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I find it strange that a book can win a GoodReads Choice Award by a landslide, and not get a Hugo nomination.<br />I think WorldCon's aging membership needs to promote itself more to attract a wider membership.<br /><br />I did my part and nominated.

Rowling, Robert Jordan, Stephen King, and... well, me.  <br /><br />There is already a great award for bestselling books. Money.  Sell as many copies as Harry Potter has, and it arrives in dumptrucks, boxcars, 747s.  You can fill your swimming pool and roll in it, like Scrooge McDuck.  You can indulge your fantasies, you can try to do good in the world, you can pay forward... or not, as you are inclined.  <br /><br />Do I think the worldcon voters got it right in their nominations for Best Series?  No, not entirely.  They left off Wild Cards.<br /><br />But all in all, those are some pretty good nominations.
