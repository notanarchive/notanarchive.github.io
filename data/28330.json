{"itemid":110,"subject":"I'm Not a Lawyer...","event":"... but I have just been interviewed by one, about the legal system of the Seven Kingdoms, and the topic of law in fantasy in general.  \r\n\r\nYou can hear my interview with David Hoffman the blogsite Concurring Opinions at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2007/12/law_talk_george_1.html\r\n\r\nDave is a law professor at Temple University as well as a fantasy fan, with a particular interest in the treatment of law in epic fantasies.  If that topic interests you, you can check out some of the earlier discussion on those issues at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2007/05/fantasys_apocal_1.html\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttp://volokh.com/posts/chain_1179774041.shtml \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nhttp://lpcprof.typepad.com/law_and_magic_blog/2007/05/welcome.html \r\n\r\nand also\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stephenbainbridge.com/punditry/comments/hoffman_on_hard_fantasy_and_the_absence_of_law/ \r\n\r\nMyself, I enjoyed the interview with Dave, and found that all these discussions gave me a lot of food for thought.  Maybe once I finish A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, I will do a legal thriller set in the Seven Kingdoms next.  John Grisham meets J.R.R. Tolkien, as they'd say in Hollywood.","ditemid":28330,"eventtime":"2007-12-18 14:33:00","props":{"commentalter":1352694256,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-12-18 21:42:47","anum":170,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html","event_timestamp":1197988380,"reply_count":54,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67008693/11151878","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?replyto=2923434","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2923434#t2923434","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2923434#t2923434","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2923434#t2923434","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"makhsihed","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://makhsihed.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2923434,"talkid":11419,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2923434#t2923434","article":"THANK YOU.<br /><br />Fantasy law and fantasy politics fascinate me.

Good stuff.<br /><br />I could see how it would leave food for thought. For one thing, I'm not strictly sure that all the law is necessarily judged by the lords in the Seven Kingdoms, as the novels have provided some tantalizing alternatives. There are village head men who probably help settle disputes between villagers, at the most basic level, though their authority may be more customary than legal; arbiters, rather than judges. <br /><br />More notably, there's a mention of \"justiciars\" in Dorne who render judgments. Then again, we also hear of bailiffs and shariffs in Dorne, and never anywhere else in the Seven Kingdoms, so maybe it's an indication of Dorne having a unique legal system compared to the rest of the realm. <br /><br />I'd say it'd make a lot of sense for there to be professional judges (and maybe even itinerant advocates) of some sort in the big cities, at the very least. It certainly seems to be the case in Braavos, where justiciars are also mentioned. Sovereign lords of urban areas would be hard pressed to judge the case load a thriving city must generate (even if they delegate some of the work to family, other than the Freys there aren't many families that could handle it), on top of everything else that they have to do.<br /><br />These justiciars and theoretical judges might be entirely drawn from the gentry and nobility, and ultimately the judiciary receives its authority from the lord and/or king who employs them, but it's still a step removed from the idea of the person having a solely personal and inherent right to render judgment.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"December 18 2007, 23:08:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1198019311,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/11848241/834968","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?replyto=2926506","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2926506#t2926506","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2926506#t2926506","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2926506#t2926506","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"justyuekitylor","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://justyuekitylor.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2926506,"talkid":11431,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28330.html?thread=2926506#t2926506","upictitle":"Black Adam: Huey","article":"I would love to see that.

In the lead in to the interview link, it mentions Time magazine calling you, \"The American Tolkien.\"  I'm torn on that one.  On the one hand, that's a hell of a compliment and in terms of groundbreaking goodness and influence I think the comparison might be a fair one.<br /><br />On the other, the word, \"Tolkien\" drags in a whole lot of references, thought, baggage, fondness, memories (all good), recent movie stuff, etc... of a very specific sort but Song is a very different animal.  In some ways the comparison does an injustice to Song in the complexity and epic scope of what you're doing.<br /><br />As a friend of mine put it, \"I love Tolkien, amazing books, no really, LOVE him.  And I know it's blasphemy, and I can't really make myself say it out loud, but I think Martin is better.\"<br /><br />It isn't a footrace and Song isn't finished yet.
