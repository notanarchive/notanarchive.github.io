{"itemid":1704,"subject":"Six Days Left","event":"Less than a week remains to cast a vote for this year's Hugo Awards.  Voting closes on July 31, but it would be wise not to wait until the last day.  Sasquan has already warned that its servers may overload if there is too large a rush of last-minute ballots.  Remember, you can vote NOW, even if you haven't finished reading, and return later to change your ballot once you've read more.\r\n\r\nThe ballot is here: http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/voting/\r\n\r\nAnd of course, you need to be a member of worldcon (Supporting or Attending, either will do) and secure a PIN to be able to vote.\r\n\r\nYou can join here:  https://sasquan.swoc.us/sasquan/reg.php \r\n\r\nMembership also allows you to vote for site selection for the 2017 worldcon.  There are four contenders: Japan, Montreal, Washington DC, and Helsinki.  \r\n\r\nParris and I are supporters of the Helsinki bid.  I was GOH at Finncon a few years ago, and at Archipelacon more recently, and the Finnish fans are wonderful.  Also, I favor making worldcon truly a global affair, which means going outside the US from time to time.  Finland has never had a worldcon.  Montreal and Japan are also outside the US, of course, but both have hosted worldcons in the recent past.  I missed the Japanese worldcon, but I understand that it is still massively in debt, so going back there so soon seems unwise.  I did attend the Montreal worldcon, and it was one of the worst-run in recent memory, with a truly horrendous hotel and party situation.  On the other hand, Washington DC has not had a worldcon since 1974, and the Washington bid is a very strong one, with a great concom and great facilities.  They are probably the favorite this year, and in any other year I'd be backing them too.  This year, though... it's still Helsinki for us.\r\n\r\nHow you choose to vote is, of course, entirely up to you.  \r\n\r\nAs for the Hugo Awards proper... I do not have the time or the space or the energy to share my own views on every story and book and writer on the ballot.  This is by no means a normal Hugo year, however; Puppygate has plunged all fandom into war as never before.  So I will recap a few of my own views from previous blog posts downstream.\r\n\r\nI oppose the \"nuclear option\" of voting No Award down the board, to protest the hijacking of the ballot by the Sad and Rabid Puppies.  \r\n\r\nI favor reading the work, and voting for the stories, books, and writers you feel are worthy of a Hugo.  Those you do NOT feel are worthy of the Hugo can and should be ranked below No Award or left off your ballot entirely.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean I am entirely opposed to voting No Award in all cases.  Far from it.  Having now finished most (not quite all) of my Hugo reading, I can say that I will probably be voting No Award myself in... hmmm... at least three categories, maybe four, maybe even five.  These are categories where in my judgement none of the nominated work is worthy of a rocket.  \r\n\r\nBut in those categories where I do find one or more nominees to be of sufficient quality, I will be voting for him or her or them, regardless of whether or not they were on a slate.  And yes, this is true even if only one nominee is worthy.  To throw out that one worthy nominee because they \"had no real competition\" (as some have suggested) seems wrong-headed to me.  If it is worthy of a Hugo, give it a Hugo, that's what I say.\r\n\r\nLet me be specific here.  Short Form Editor, Long Form Editor are all slate, but there are nominees in both who deserve a Hugo, and I'll be voting for them.  The Puppies liked a lot (though not all) of the nominees in the two Dramatic Presentation categories as well... but you know, so did I, so I'll be voting for those as well.  Sorry, but IMNSHO, only an idiot would want to \"no award\" GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY or INTERSTELLAR because the Puppies slated them. I am not going to tell you which movie or TV show or editor or novel I am voting for.  I've mentioned some that I liked in older blog posts.  Your mileage may vary; read, watch, consider, vote.  \r\n\r\nI will, however, make one exception there, one \"endorsement,\" if you will.  I am voting for LAURA MIXON for Best Fan Writer, and I urge everyone reading this to do the same.  (Hardly a surprise, I know, since I suggested that she be nominated in the first place).  Having looked at the Hugo packet, I can say with a fair amount of certainty that Laura is plainly the best <i><b>writer</b></i> of the five nominees... but there's more to my choice than that.  In this year of all years, with Puppygate turning so toxic and hatespeech spreading all over the internet, it behooves us more than ever to honor someone who spoke up AGAINST Hate and for healing, not by spewing vitriol in retaliation, but calmly, dispassionately, with clean hands and composure and... most of all... compassion.  A victory for Mixon here would have huge symbolic value, I think; a vote for her is a vote for decency, and a vote against the trolls and haters of all stripes and persuasions, be they left-wing or right-wing or just loony.\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\nFILE 770 reports that Sasquan membership has passed 10,000, and that more than 2900 Hugo ballots have already been cast.  http://file770.com/?p=23985   The record was set last year at Loncon, when 3587 ballots were received.  Given the Puppygate war, there's a good chance that Sasquan will break that record, since it seems memberships are still pouring in.\r\n\r\nSix days left.\r\n\r\nLet your voice be heard.","ditemid":436370,"eventtime":"2015-07-25 13:06:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, conventions, puppygate","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1438208935,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Six Days Left http://goo.gl/lHMkl2","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.657193022831869]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1437851170}","revtime":1438272873},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-25 19:06:02","anum":146,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html","event_timestamp":1437829560,"reply_count":47,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126262415/50675361","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164370#t22164370","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164370#t22164370","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164370#t22164370","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164370#t22164370","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1274810","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/jeddy.wilkinson.jr","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22164370,"talkid":86579,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164370#t22164370","upictitle":"Jeddy B Wilkinson Jr: pic#126262415","article":"Once the voting is closed would you be willing to disclose how you voted?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 25 2015, 19:11:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Just out of curiosity","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/jeddy.wilkinson.jr","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jeddy B Wilkinson Jr","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1274810","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=50675361&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jeddy B Wilkinson Jr","ctime_ts":1437851513,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164626#t22164626","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164626#t22164626","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164626#t22164626","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22164626,"talkid":86580,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/436370.html?thread=22164626#t22164626","above":22164370,"upictitle":"George R.R.

You put a lot of time, blood, sweat, and tears into writing about puppygate, it's obvious to anyone that the issue was very important to you, yet instead of fighting fire with more rules and regulations, it sounds to me like you're willing to trust the better angels of our nature, and to promote an intelligent solution to the problem in the future.  I'm not sure how well that will work out for next year, but it impresses upon me the idea that unlike most of the puppies/rabbs, you're able to...I don't know, rise above it I guess.<br /><br />I hope I'm understanding your point of view correctly George - again, I wouldn't have expected a self proclaimed \"very liberal\" person to shy away for just trying to regulate the problem away.<br /><br />I think this is an important factoid, something the other side of this issue could take a page from.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year

It's a clear improvement on the current system. EPH doesn't change the culture of nominating; you still nominate up to five works you deem Hugo-worthy. It's only the tallying that is different. It doesn't prevent bloc-voting but rather, EPH mitigates bloc-voting to a level of influence commensurate with actual voter proportions. How is that a bad thing?<br /><br />What other solutions are there? Talking might work with the Sad Puppies, but it's really the Rabid Puppies who got their works onto the ballot, and you've said there is no talking to Theodore Beale.  Beale and his Rabid Puppies show no signs of stopping as this appears to be a long term (~10 years) grudge on his part & he has expressed a desire to destroy the Hugos. I think EPH will mitigate their influence; if they can only get one or two finalists, bloc-voting will no longer a dominant strategy able to shut-out whole categories & Beale will probably lose interest after a while (I suspect part of the attraction for him is gaming: leveraging a relatively small number of nominators to achieve a big impact on the Hugo ballot). If we do nothing, Beale and his group will be able to continue gaming the Hugos and shutting out whole categories. I cannot accept that. Do you have an alternative?<br /><br />As for increasing the nominating numbers, well there have been efforts for years toward that but although Hugo nominating numbers have been increasing in recent years, the growth is slow. And even if more people nominate, under the current system bloc-voters will still have a disproportionately bigger influence on the nominations. If the nominating system remains unchanged, the number crunching says that we need at least five non-slate voters for every slate voter as ~200(?) out of ~1000 nominators were able to shut-out a number of categories this year. I am not confident that more nominators will be the solution unless we also change the rules.<br /><br />We have \"No Award\" as a last resort for the real dross when it comes to voting, but I would rather read & vote on Hugo-worthy candidates than have to deploy \"No Award\".<br /><br />You have said previously that it is an honor to (merely) be nominated. If we get mostly slated finalists every year, that won't be true anymore.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 27 2015, 03:40:43

Not that you are voting a puppy slate, but that's the way it will be played. <br />I've written to James Gunn in the forlorn hope that he'd address the issue and disavow the slate (which would let me pencil it in) but, as expected, received no reply.  More is the pity.<br /><br />I'm voting along cleanly defined lines:  slate = no award or off the ballot, regardless of the category, regardless of the work.  If that is effective, everyone on a slate in future will be rushing to disavow their inclusion, which is the effect that I am hoping it has.<br /><br />We've got different political strategies, but that difference does not make one of them \"idiotic\" and the other \"genius\".
