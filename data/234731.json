{"itemid":916,"subject":"Nasmith to Illustrate GAME OF THRONES","event":"You've been asking for it.  And now we're doing it.\r\n\r\nI'm delighted to be able to announce the forthcoming publication of a new, deluxe, limited edition of A GAME OF THRONES, to be published by my friends at Subterranean Press, and illustrated by the massively talented TED NASMITH.\r\n\r\nTed is widely considered to be one of the \"Big Three\" of Tolkien illustrators; along with Alan Lee and John Howe, he has brought Middle Earth to life like no one else.  And he he is no stranger to my own world, either.  Ted painted the all of the wonderful landscapes for the gorgeous 2011 Ice & Fire calendar, with what I consider to be THE definitive depictions of thirteen of the great castles of Westeros.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000erd51/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000erd51/s640x480\" width=\"487\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt will be a thrill to work with Ted once again.  You can see a lot more of his work on his own website at http://www.tednasmith.com/\r\n\r\nI have always loved illustrated books.  No doubt that's an artifact of my childhood, and early exposure to the work of Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth in books like MEN OF IRON, ROBIN HOOD, and TREASURE ISLAND.  Almost since the day I started writing, I've wanted to see my own novels done in the same manner.  Pyle and Wyeth are long gone, alas (though their work remains, and if there is anyone out there reading this who loves it as much as I do, be sure and visit the Brandywine Gallery should your travels ever take you to Philadelphia), but their heritage lives on in the work of today's top illustrators.  Nasmith is one.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second illustrated edition of A GAME OF THRONES (actually, the second ENGLISH LANGUAGE edition... my Finnish publishers also issued a nice illustrated edition in honor of my visit to Finncon, and the Chinese and Japanese editions have also included some nice interior artwork).  Long-time fans and collectors will recall that my dream of having the series published in a series of beautiful illustrated books was initially brought to fruition by Meisha Merlin, a small press out of Atlanta, who released numbered limited editions of both A GAME OF THRONES (illustrated by the late Jeff Jones) and A CLASH OF KINGS (illustrated by John Howe).  Lovely books, both... though not without certain flaws, admittedly, but...\r\n\r\nMeisher Merlin GAME OF THRONES\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h7srf/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h7srf/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"429\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMeisha Merlin CLASH OF KINGS\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h8fh7/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h8fh7/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"437\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe original plan was for Meisha Merlin to do the whole series, of course.  Unfortunately, the press ran into certain financial difficulties, as small presses often do, and ultimately went bust.  Fortunately, I was able to get off the ship before it sank, and move the limited edition series over to Subterranean Press.  Subterranean picked up where Meisha Merlin had left off, and issued signed, numbered, limited, slipcased editions of A STORM OF SWORDS (illustrated by Charles Vess) and A FEAST FOR CROWS (illustrated by Tom Canty).  The Subterranean edition of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS (illustrated by Marc Fishman)is in the works even as I write.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say the changeover was without problems.  The Meisha Merlin books are gorgeous, and so are the SubPress books... but they are also different.  Subterranean has its own views on book design, its own ideas about graphics, its own way of doing things, and its own likes, dislikes, and preferences.  When Subterranean took over, they changed the size of the book, dropped some of the features of the Meisha Merlin limiteds (the gilded pages, for example), even split the books into two volumes (in a single slipcase).  All of which led to a certain amount of unhappy collectors.  While I think everyone appreciated the quality of the books, and the love that had gone into them, the Meisha Merlin and Subterranean editions could not really be considered a SET, except in the broadest terms.  The books did not match.  Lined up side by side on the bookshelf, they did not look as if they belonged together.\r\n\r\nMeisha Merlin STORM OF SWORDS\r\n((never published))\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h9fcg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h9fcg/s640x480\" width=\"310\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSubterranean STORM OF SWORDS\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hapss/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hapss/s640x480\" width=\"316\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hb6ke/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hb6ke/s640x480\" width=\"318\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSmall wonder then that, almost from the day that the Subterranean STORM OF SWORDS was first published, both Bill Schafer and I began to receive letters from collectors asking that SubPress do its own editions of A GAME OF THRONES and A CLASH OF KINGS, in a format similar to their later limiteds, to make a true set.  There has been a steady stream of such letters and emails over the intervening years... enough so that Bill finally decided that they had a point and, with my blessing, went to Bantam Spectra and secured the license.\r\n\r\nAs with the other Subterranean editions (and the Meisha Merlin editions before them), the Nasmith GAME OF THRONES will be signed and numbered and slipcased, limited to 52 lettered copies (A through ZZ) and 448 numbered copies (1 through 448).  First right of purchase will go to those customers buying the SubPress limited of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.  The series is fully subscribed at the moment, I fear... but there are always drop outs, so I expect some copies will become available to new buyers (though probably not many).\r\n\r\nThe value of those Meisha Merlin editions has reached astronomical heights on the collector's market in the last year or two, and I know there will be some concern about how these new SubPress editions will impact that value.  There is really no certain way to predict that, of course; the rare book market can be volatile.  But I did speak to several collectors and rare book dealers before signing off on these new editions, and the general opinion was that any impact would be minimal.  The SubPress edition is in no sense a reprint of the Meisha Merlin, after all.  Only the text will be the same (and the text is the same in all the trade hardcover and paperback editions as well).  The size, format, type font, book design, paper stock, and everything else about the Subterranean edition will be different.  And of course Ted Nasmith's art will all be completely new, and original to the book.  The Meisha Merlin books will be just as rare as they are now, and I suspect their value will continue to appreciate... (at least as long as the HBO series stays on the air, but that's a different discussion).  But hundreds of new fans will now have the chance to add a gorgeous limited edition of A GAME OF THRONES to their shelves, and perhaps some of the many \"busted sets\" out there will be completed.\r\n\r\nI think it's a win/ win.  And I know that Ted Nasmith is going to give us some stunning artwork.  So thanks to all of you out there who have been pushing for this through the years, and sending us all those emails.","ditemid":234731,"eventtime":"2011-08-13 18:28:00","props":{"current_location":"santa fe","taglist":"collecting, a game of thrones, subterranean, art collecting","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1315176622,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1315176718},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-08-14 01:06:12","anum":235,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html","event_timestamp":1313260080,"reply_count":67,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97542034/7302185","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525419#t14525419","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525419#t14525419","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525419#t14525419","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"twistedsheets10","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twistedsheets10.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14525419,"talkid":56739,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525419#t14525419","article":"OH MY GOD.<br /><br />/seal claps in delight","upictitle":"twistedsheets10: jon snow kicks everyone&#39;s ass","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"5 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"August 14 2011, 02:02:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twistedsheets10.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"twistedsheets10","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"twistedsheets10","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://twistedsheets10.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"twistedsheets10","ctime_ts":1313287366,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/60098084/3145235","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525675#t14525675","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525675#t14525675","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525675#t14525675","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"semaht","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://semaht.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14525675,"talkid":56740,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/234731.html?thread=14525675#t14525675","upictitle":"~/semaht\\~: Spirit","article":"Cool!<br />And let me add a shout-out to John R.

I don't see how you end up worse either.  <br /><br />You don't believe the impact on the value of the old MM editions will be minimal.  Maybe you're right.  I am not going to predict the ups and downs of the rare book market.  However, I did consult a couple of dealers in rare books before I signed off on this.  Experts on this subject.  One of them said, \"Well, I'm not going to lower MY prices, I can tell you that.\"  The other one, when asked if the new SP editions would lower the value of old MM editions, said, \"If I'm buying, sure it will.  If I'm selling, not at all.\"  Time will tell.<br /><br />You're just flat out wrong when you say I am \"doubling the supply,\" however.  This is a totally different edition.  Meisha Merlin printed 500 copies of their GAME OF THRONES, 52 lettered and 448 numbered (actually, an unknown number of PC editions are floating around out there as well... only a few, I'd hope, but I don't really know).  That's all there is.  There won't be any more.  No one is printing any more of those books.  <br /><br />When you do a limited edition, it is the EDITION that's limited.  <br /><br />The Bantam hardcover of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is already in its seventh printing.  Hell, by now, it may be in its eighth.  The ONLY difference between the first printing and the seventh printing is a few tiny missing numbers on the copyright page.  Yet for collectors of first editions, only the first printing will do, not the third or fifth or seventh.  Later printings will not impact the value of the first in the slightest... and that's when the books are absolutely identical, but for that line of numbers.  <br /><br />In this case, we have two editions that are completely different in every respect.  It makes no sense to me that the existence of the new one will cause the value of the old one to fall.<br /><br />If you really believe it will, however... well, the value of those MM books is astronomical at present... so by your belief, there could not possibly be a better time to sell.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"August 14 2011,
