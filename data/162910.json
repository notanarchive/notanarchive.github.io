{"itemid":636,"subject":"The White Knight","event":"The ranks are filling out on HBO's GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nSer Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, will be played by Ulsterman IAN MCELHINNEY, Belfast born and bred.\r\n\r\nSer Barristan is a veteran of tournament and battle, and McElhinney a veteran of stage and screen who has been acting professionally since 1981.  He was a pope on THE TUDORS, a captain on HORATIO HORNBLOWER, a priest, a doctor, a detective... though I believe this is his first turn as a knight.  He's no stranger to the Paint Hall, though; the huge shipyard soundstage where we'll be doing much of our filming was also the place where they built the CITY OF EMBER, in which he had a role.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000b4ffc/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000b4ffc/s320x240\" width=\"191\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nMcElhinney is another terrific addition to our cast.  He's a splendid actor, and his readings captured all of Ser Barristan's dignity and nobility.  I can't wait to see him in his Kingsguard armor and long white cloak.","ditemid":162910,"eventtime":"2010-07-15 00:13:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":166,"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1358531607,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"28:2,17:14,18:5,30:2,16:14,3:37,25:2,4:25,19:25,26:2,9:31,21:2,13:8"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-07-15 06:13:42","anum":94,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html","event_timestamp":1279152780,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/31153886/91915","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?replyto=10519646","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10519646#t10519646","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10519646#t10519646","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10519646#t10519646","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dmoira","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dmoira.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10519646,"talkid":41092,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10519646#t10519646","upictitle":"Stephanie J: Love her","article":"I imagined Barristan with higher cheekbones, but I am excited to see Mr. McElhinney is otherwise, as I would imagine the squire.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 15 2010, 06:59:35 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dmoira.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dmoira","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dmoira","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dmoira.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dmoira","ctime_ts":1279177175,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/47030530/1050519","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?replyto=10521182","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10521182#t10521182","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10521182#t10521182","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10521182#t10521182","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"silverjaime","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://silverjaime.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10521182,"talkid":41098,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10521182#t10521182","upictitle":"SilverJaime: James closeup","article":"Love Ian McElhinney!

used in the LotR movies. The international actors were all trained in British accents, but the regional UK accents that were used seemed quite random.<br /> For example, Sean Bean used his own Northern English accent, the actor who played Pippin used his own natural accent, which is Scottish, the American actor who played Sam was trained in a West country accent (a lighter version of what most people know as a classic 'pirate' accent) and everyone else pretty much used the same generic English middle class accent no matter if they were from Gondor, Rivendell or Bag End.<br /> <br />I think a big production like this is a perfect chance to add an extra layer of believability by giving characters from the same area appropriate and consistent accents. For example, I've always imagined the wildings having Scottish accents (even though your Wall was not build by Hadrian)<br />Of course it goes without saying that I won't want to hear any American accents, they worked perfectly in Pulp Fiction, but just sound wrong in fantasy.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 15 2010, 15:18:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Accents","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://silkeno.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"silkeno","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"silkeno","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://silkeno.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"silkeno","ctime_ts":1279207111,"tracked":0},{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"nilhenwen","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nilhenwen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10525790,"talkid":41116,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10525790#t10525790","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nilhenwen.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nilhenwen","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nilhenwen","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nilhenwen.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nilhenwen","ctime_ts":1279211516,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?replyto=10527070","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10527070#t10527070","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10527070#t10527070","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10527070#t10527070","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10527070,"talkid":41121,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/162910.html?thread=10527070#t10527070","above":10525790,"upictitle":"George R.R.
