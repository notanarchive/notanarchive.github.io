{"itemid":1892,"subject":"NFL Draft, Round One","event":"So the first round in the NFL Draft was last night, and both of my teams went for players from Ohio State.   Any Buckeyes here who can tell me more about them?  Jetboygirl, where are you?\r\n\r\nThe Jets picked a linebacker, Darren Lee, at twenty.  Supposed to be very fast.  A sideline to sideline guy.  Okay, sounds good.  More speed on the defense never hurts.  I am glad they did not draft the Memphis QB everyone wanted them to.  He's a project, and we need a QB now.  They need to sign Fitz.\r\n\r\nThe Giants, at ten, drafted a cornerback with the unlikely name of Eli Apple.  Seven picks in, the G-Men were sitting pretty, with their two top choices still available.  But the the Titans traded up to eight and drafted the offensive lineman the Giants wanted, and the Bear vaulted up from eleven to nine just to get grab the top linebacker, Floyd.  In other words, the Giants got their lunch eaten.  Leaving nothing but an apple.  Of course, in this pass-happy league, everyone needs corners, and the Giants need them more than most, considering how many passing yards they gave up last year.  Still and all... I would have been happier if they'd picked Shaq Lawson, the pass rusher.\r\n\r\nThe damned Cowboys got the guy I really wanted, running back Ezekiel Elliott.  Curse them!\r\n\r\nToday we get rounds two and three.\r\n\r\nI am hoping the G-Men pick up 'Bama RB and Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry.   Or else maybe took a chance and grabbed Myles Jack, the injured UCLA linebacker.\r\n\r\nBut who knows?  Anything could happen.  That's what makes these drafts so much fun.","ditemid":484443,"eventtime":"2016-04-29 14:29:00","props":{"current_mood":"confused","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Apr 29 20:28:43 2016]R [Fri Apr 29 20:28:44 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/726146219823616001 ","current_moodid":6,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1462134054,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/726146219823616001","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.726301367181345]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1461962516}","revtime":1462141783},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-29 20:28:37","anum":91,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484443.html","event_timestamp":1461940140,"reply_count":28,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123625404/71425868","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484443.html?thread=24330331#t24330331","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484443.html?thread=24330331#t24330331","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484443.html?thread=24330331#t24330331","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2649707","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/MikeSzucs","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24330331,"talkid":95040,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484443.html?thread=24330331#t24330331","upictitle":"Mike Szucs: pic#123625404","article":"Both are good, you'll be very happy with Apple.
