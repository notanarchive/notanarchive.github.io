I only wished the autograph sessions were handled with more care. I was turned away from both sessions and honestly it was my entire reason for coming to Con Carolina. Unfortunately, I left with my heart broke and wallet much lighter than before. I did have a good moment though, without knowing your assistant Raya, I asked if I could help her with her groceries that she was dropping all over the elevator floor. She politely declined my help, but it wasn't until later that I knew why she declined. When you walked into the Opening ceremonies and she came walking in behind you, I knew then why she declined my help, she thought I just wanted to see the great and powerful George R. R. Martin. Well , hopefully I will get to have something signed when you visit Joesph-Beth Booksellers in Lexington, KY for you future book signings.
