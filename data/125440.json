{"itemid":490,"subject":"Learn to Write Good","event":"Judging by the emails I receive, there are a lot of aspiring writers among my readership.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to make mention of a couple of summer writing programs that might be of interest to you.\r\n\r\nFirst, the legendary Clarion workshop, which began with Damon Knight in Clarion College, Pennsylvania, and is now in scenic San Diego.  An intensive six-week writer's boot camp that will make you, break you, maybe change your life.   I will be one of the instructors at this year's Clarion, along with Delia Sherman, Dale Bailey, Samuel R. Delany, Jeff Vandermeer, and Anne Vandermeer.  For more details, check out\r\n\r\nhttp://clarion.ucsd.edu/\r\n\r\nApplications for Clarion are being accepted now, and will close on March 1... so if you've ever wanted to have me read and critique your work, and learn the secret handshake and the diagonal relationship, speak now or hold your peace until the next time I do a workshop (which probably won't be for a few more years). \r\n\r\n[[ I do NOT read unpublished manuscripts that are mailed or emailed to me, so don't even think that.  I do my teaching and critiquing only with a workshop context.  And sorry, no, I won't be your mentor.]]\r\n\r\nClarion has been helping to turn out professional SF and fantasy writers since the 60s.  Maybe you're the next one.  You'll never know unless you apply.  But be warned, only a few are chosen.  Admissions are extremely competitive, with only one of five applicants getting in.\r\n\r\nFor writers who are already published, but are looking to take the next step in their careers, there is the Taos Toolbox, founded and run by my friend Walter Jon Williams and held right here in scenic New Mexico.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.taostoolbox.com\r\n\r\nWalter Jon's pitches his Toolbox as more of a \"graduate study\" program, for writers with a bit more experience.  Graduates of Clarion, Clarion West, and Odyssey, neopros with a few sales under their belts, even journeymen looking to improve.  I am not connected with the Toolbox, but I did a guest lecture there a few years ago, and it struck me as a great program.   This year Nancy Kress will be assisting WJW with the teaching, and Carrie Vaughn (of Kitty and Wild Cards fame) will be giving a guest lecture.  And when you're not writing, reading, critiquing, or listening to lectures, hey, you'll be in Taos.\r\n\r\nClarion Workshop and the Taos Toolbox.  If you want to write, check 'em out.","ditemid":125440,"eventtime":"2010-01-07 12:37:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":423,"taglist":"appearances, writing","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":70,"commentalter":1279690624,"personifi_tags":"28:2,17:4,18:11,6:2,30:2,57:6,46:2,23:8,16:4,3:66,19:2,4:53,9:15,nterms:no","interface":"flat","verticals_list":"culture","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-01-07 19:37:03","anum":0,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html","event_timestamp":1262867820,"reply_count":44,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97087660/15077053","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?replyto=8243712","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243712#t8243712","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243712#t8243712","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243712#t8243712","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"davedeburgh","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://davedeburgh.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8243712,"talkid":32202,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243712#t8243712","upictitle":"davedeburgh: pic#97087660","article":"Hey George, I just posted info for another writing course on my blog -  it's on online course and is being done in conjunction with one of South Africa's biggest publishers; here's the info: <a href='http://davebrendon.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/the-random-house-struik-get-smarter-creative-writing-course/' rel='nofollow'>http://davebrendon.wordpress.com/2010/0<wbr />1/07/the-random-house-struik-get-smarter-c<wbr />reative-writing-course/</a><br /><br />Looking forward to the day I can take on Clarion! :-)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"January 7 2010, 19:41:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://davedeburgh.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"davedeburgh","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"davedeburgh","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://davedeburgh.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"davedeburgh","ctime_ts":1262893288,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/108871487/6392635","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?replyto=8243968","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243968#t8243968","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243968#t8243968","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243968#t8243968","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"davekirtley","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://davekirtley.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8243968,"talkid":32203,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125440.html?thread=8243968#t8243968","upictitle":"davekirtley: pic#108871487","article":"Another one people should know about is <a href=\"http://alpha.spellcaster.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha</a>, a one-week summer workshop in Pittsburgh for writers aged 14-19.
