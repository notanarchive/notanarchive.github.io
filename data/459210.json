THE EXPANSE premieres tonight on the SyFy channel.\r\n\r\nFor those who came in late, this is the big new space series based on a terrific series of novels by James S.A.

I've written over 100,000 words about your books. I think I am seeing that you've hidden the cause of the Long Night - some kind of comet/moon impact which rained down black meteors on \"Planetos\" - inside of the folklore of the book, and then again in the symbolism of highly metaphorical scenes in the book. Am I hallucinating? Sea Dragon, Storm God thunderbolt, Hammer of the Waters - these are moon meteor impacts, right? Of course you don't want to confirm spoiler things, but can you at least tell me if I am completely off my rocker, if I'm suffering from advanced case of apophenia? A simple \"you might be on to something\" would be sweet, if you can spare it. <br /><br />P.S. If I am right in my general thinking, you're knowledge of mythology and use of symbolism in regards to mythology is absolutely incredible, and I thank you for you taking the time to write in the manner you do. It's enriched my life tremendously to follow all the trails, I've learned so much about symbolism and mythology in the process, things I was already in to. <br /><br />Cheers, Lucifer means Lightbringer a.k.a. LmL<br /><br />Don't want to spam you with links but you can find my stuff easily by googling Lucifer means Lightbringer. Not that you don't have plenty to do ;)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 17 2015, 19:15:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Am I hallucinating?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1068527456505459/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"David Beers","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3433299","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77191246&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"David Beers","ctime_ts":1450379705,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459210.html?thread=23270858#t23270858","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459210.html?thread=23270858#t23270858","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459210.html?thread=23270858#t23270858","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23270858,"talkid":90901,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/459210.html?thread=23270858#t23270858","above":23264970,"upictitle":"George R.R.
