{"itemid":1929,"subject":"Next Sunday at the Jean Cocteau","event":"If you're going to be in Santa Fe a week from tomorrow -- or anywhere in the Land of Enchantment, really -- do swing by the Jean Cocteau Cinema.  \r\n\r\nWe've got not one but <b>two</b> very special events planned for Sunday, July 24.\r\n\r\nFirst up, at 2:00 in the afternoon, will be a Wild Cards Author Event, followed by a signing.   Yes, most of the Usual Suspects will be on hand, the motley crew of New Mexico writers who started the series some thirty years ago, but they'll be joined by some Wild Carders, new and old, who are coming in from afar to join us.  Right now we have some nineteen (yes, I said 19!) writers scheduled to take part... from Chicago, from Denver, from New Hampshire, from Texas, from California, from Kentucky.  Come by and meet them all!  And get your books signed... not only your Wild Cards books (though we expect to have all the volumes presently in print on offer), but also some of the other great novels by the participating writers.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/371586/371586_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/371804/371804_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/372029/372029_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/372463/372463_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/372691/372691_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/372768/372768_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe format of this one should be fun.  Melinda Snodgrass will be hosting, interviewing each of our guests in turn.  But we'll be doing this \"in universe,\" so she won't be interviewing the writers, she'll be interviewing their <b>characters</b>.  And Weeds knows where all the bodies are buried, so I expect this to be a hoot and a half.\r\n\r\nAnd that's just the afternoon event.\r\n\r\nCome evening, we'll be putting Melinda to work again, with a very special screening of CHAOS ON THE BRIDGE, William Shatner's tell-all documentary about the rocky beginnings of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.   <lj-embed id=\"748\"/>\r\n\r\nMelinda knows where the bodies are buried on the Enterprise as well; she was there, and she was one of the insiders that Shatner interviewed for the documentary.  She will be hosting the screening, and answering questions afterwards... and if that was not enough, she's arranged for DAVID GERROLD to join us as well, via the wonders of Skype.\r\n\r\nIt should be quite a Sunday.   Be there.   I will.","ditemid":493911,"eventtime":"2016-07-16 19:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, wild cards, writing, television, signings, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Jul 17 01:35:47 2016]R [Sun Jul 17 01:35:49 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/754489751319621634 ","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1469052850,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/754489751319621634","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.671068969684095]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1468719394}","revtime":1469415928},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-07-17 01:35:47","anum":87,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/493911.html","event_timestamp":1468697760,"reply_count":12,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126336705/78208092","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/493911.html?thread=24784215#t24784215","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/493911.html?thread=24784215#t24784215","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/493911.html?thread=24784215#t24784215","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3747758","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ricbit","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24784215,"talkid":96813,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/493911.html?thread=24784215#t24784215","article":"Hey GRRM, I just wanted to tell that I ordered some books from Brazil, and they arrived very fast.

And one I became a fan of by accident. I used to sneer at lovers at ST. And then I was stuck at home one evening, with nothing to do and decided to just watch an episode of STNG and thought, this is not bad....ended up watching re-runs and was hooked. The show was massively popular up here in Canada. I tried to get tickets to see the final episode at the Skydome but it was 'sold out'. But truly the show was creativity at its' best.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 months ago","ctime":"July 20 2016, 14:49:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"What a Show!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/106227139128751485436","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Vittoria Colonna","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3512846","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77455537&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Vittoria Colonna","ctime_ts":1469026190,"tracked":0}]}
