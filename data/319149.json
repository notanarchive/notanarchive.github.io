My name is Maxi Bolongaita and I'm from the small island of Cebu in the Philippines. Insignificant, I know, but please read on.<br /><br />Seven or eight years back, a friend of mine, Miguel Ouano, introduced your book a Game of Thrones to us. Back then, books like that weren't popular in our country so there were very precious few copies going around. He introduced the book to us, first to his friends (my boyfriend included) and then to his friend's girlfriends. We had one copy, it was tattered and somewhat beaten up, but we all fell in love with it.<br /><br />A few hours ago, this guy Miguel Ouano, died of a cardiac arrest. He had cancer of the nerves and he had been battling it for over a year until it relapsed. Sometime during the new year, the cancer reared its ugly head and the MRI showed that it had spread throughout his whole body. He was in a coma for the last few hours. <br /><br />Miguel loved your books so much that he was fairly obsessed over the series and he even had the board game. We used to spend countless hours talking about Jaime and Cersei and how bad ass Tyrion was. When discussing who was the rightful King of the seven kingdoms, he was for Stannis Baratheon. He would go around and say he was Azor A'hai reborn. He would insert \"for the night is dark and full of terrors\" in ordinary conversations.<br /><br />Essentially, this guy was probably your biggest fan in the whole of Cebu, Philippines. <br /><br />If you would be so kind and if you could please share some kind words in memory of him, we, his friends and family, would greatly appreciate it. In retrospect, you and your books provided a respite for him in his time of great struggle. <br /><br />thank you so much, sir.<br /><br />Sincerely, Max B.

The line I waited in was full of young, new readers of the series. They were very entertaining to say the least. I thought more than once you would get a chuckle from their comments.<br /> I was the older guy who thanked you for coming to Texas while you signed my map. I meant every word. You are very gracious and deserving of all the attention.<br /> Thank you for the characters that are so real to me.<br />Keegan","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 10 2013, 02:53:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Thanks for coming to Texas!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://profiles.google.com/116650785971870539710","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ext_1747825","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1747825","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=62724302&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ext_1747825","ctime_ts":1365562387,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17560493#t17560493","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17560493#t17560493","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17560493#t17560493","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vikjha","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vikjha.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17560493,"talkid":68595,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17560493#t17560493","upictitle":"vikjha: pic#0","article":"that was an interesting interview... i was sort of shocked when i heard about that 50 thousand dollar comic book you have. my cousin worked for the publishing company that published marvel comic books in the 90s so every single time i saw her she would bring me boxes of comics (sometimes multiple copies of each)... combining my DC, Image, Darkhorse (did DC buy them now) on top... all in all i had maybe 5-6 boxes. when i moved out of my townhouse apt two kids from india were coming to live there so i left it for them to read i wonder if it could have payed for my future children's college educations now lol. anyways, i only paid for 10-15% of them and i don't even have my highschool yearbooks anymore (i recently donated a song of ice and fire to the library... i own dance digital im gonna rebuy the rest of the series at some point for kindle as well) so i don't really mind. pay it forward","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 10 2013, 14:58:40 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"50 k comic book","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://vikjha.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"vikjha","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"vikjha","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://vikjha.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"vikjha","ctime_ts":1365605920,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17561261#t17561261","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17561261#t17561261","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17561261#t17561261","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17561261,"talkid":68598,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/319149.html?thread=17561261#t17561261","above":17560493,"upictitle":"George R.R.
