{"itemid":1980,"subject":"Five in a Row","event":"The Giants won their fifth game in a row on Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was, admittedly, not as convincing a win as I would have liked.   The opponent was the woeful (this year, anyway) Chicago Bears, with the worst offense in the NFL, but even so the Giants came out sleepwalking during the first half and let the Monsters of the Midway take an early lead.\r\n\r\nThankfully, they woke up in the third quarter and took command, with a couple of nice touchdown drives that put them well ahead.  Not far <b>enough</b> ahead for my comfort, mind you.  Come the fourth quarter, the playcalling turned absurdly conservative.   One more score would have sealed the game, but instead the G-Men played run, run, run, kick, trying to run down the clock... a rather dangerous tactic, given how much our run game sucks this season.  The Bears could still have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat up to the last moment.  It took a late Jay Cutler INT to nail down the win.\r\n\r\nLandon Collins, who made the pick, looks like the real deal.  A star in the making.  The whole defense played well.  They get better every week.  Kudos to Spags, and all the guys on D, especially Snacks, Vernon, and JPP.\r\n\r\nIt was great to see Victor Cruz back as well.\r\n\r\nSo... five in a row... and a good shot at a wild card berth.  Maybe even more, if the Cowboys stumble.   The G-Men are the only team to beat them this year.\r\n\r\n(The Jets avoided losing by having a bye).","ditemid":507063,"eventtime":"2016-11-22 16:57:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Nov 22 23:57:34 2016]R [Tue Nov 22 23:57:35 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/801213064930476032 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1480193272,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/801213064930476032","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.732095550426055]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1479859080}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1980?v=1480193311","revtime":1480193306},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-22 23:57:34","anum":183,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507063.html","event_timestamp":1479833820,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125214801/76457752","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507063.html?thread=25298871#t25298871","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507063.html?thread=25298871#t25298871","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507063.html?thread=25298871#t25298871","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3225823","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10100278071556205/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25298871,"talkid":98823,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507063.html?thread=25298871#t25298871","upictitle":"April Hill: pic#125214801","article":"They were woeful last year, too.
