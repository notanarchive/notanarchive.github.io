{"itemid":2011,"subject":"Underwood Defeats Trump","event":"Well, looks like Frank Underwood would defeat Donald Trump in a landslide, based on the responses to my last post.  Gregg Hartmann finished a distant third, and many comments ignored his candidacy entirely... which is mostly a result of name recognition, I think.  Trump is, alas, real, and Underwood is featured in a hit television show.  A character from a series of books just cannot compete, even when the series is as long-running and popular as Wild Cards has been.\r\n\r\nPlainly, many of you need to read more Wild Cards.  Get right on that, please!  A new year is a great time for a new addiction!  (And you can get signed copies from the Jean Cocteau bookshop).\r\n\r\nOne aside before I return to the subject of presidents.  I was disappointed by how many of the comments chose to ignore my request to stay on topic and stay off real world politics.  By now, of course, I am used to the people who will send comments about GAME OF THRONES and WINDS OF WINTER, no matter what the actual topic of the original post is, so that was no surprise.  But when I say \"no real world politics, please\" and still get long screeds about Hilary with nary a mention of Underwood or Hartmann, that displays either a lack of reading comprehension or a certain fundamental discourtesy.  If you want to play here, you need to play by my rules.\r\n\r\nGetting back to presidents... one point raised by a number of comments got me curious.  Several persons observed that Underwood was a murderer; that is, that he had actually killed people with his own hands.  True enough.  But that started me wondering -- how many actual American presidents and presidential candidates have done the same?  How many of our presidents have been killers?\r\n\r\n(Note that I say 'killer' and not 'murderer,' which is a somewhat different thing).\r\n\r\nI am a history junkie, as many of you know, but as much history as I've read, I'm unsure of the answer to that question.  There's only one president that I know for certain took a life himself, personally (as opposed to commanding troops in combat, or declaring war).  That would be Andrew Jackson, who once killed a man in a duel.  If we broaden the field to include vice-presidents and candidates, you also have Aaron Burr, who rather famously shot Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/408988/408988_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/409123/409123_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/409384/409384_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nYet surely there must be others.  Many of our presidents came from a military background.  Grant, Washington, and Eisenhower were famous generals before reaching the presidency, and they were far from the only ones.  William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor were also famous generals, and a lot of the presidents after the Civil War had served as generals in the Union army. There were also plenty of presidents who fought in one war or another in less exalted ranks.  JFK and PT 109, for instance.  Even Lincoln fought in the Black Hawk War in Illinois as a young man.  \r\n\r\nServing in the ranks and commanding troops is not the same as killing with your own hands, however.  Not having read all of their various memoirs or biographies, I have no idea whether Grant or Eisenhower or Washington or any of our other commanders in chief ever mentioned having shot someone in the face or stabbed them in the belly with a bayonet when they were still captains or corporals or whatever (generals don't usually actually gets their hands bloody, at least during the modern era) during their long military careers.\r\n\r\nI know there are history wonks out there even more obsessive than me.  Does anyone know?  How many of our past presidents and presidential candidates were killers?  We have Andrew Jackson and... anyone else?\r\n\r\n(And please spare me comments like 'FDR was a killer because he brought us into WWII.'  That is NOT the question on the table).\r\n\r\nOnce again: please stay on topic.","ditemid":515014,"eventtime":"2017-01-09 13:15:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"history","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jan  9 20:15:45 2017]R [Mon Jan  9 20:15:45 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/818551858922930179 ","current_moodid":30,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1484077410,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/818551858922930179","reading_time":6,"picture_keyword":"distress","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.578121917015561]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1483992980}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2011?v=1484112653","revtime":1484077442},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-09 20:15:42","anum":198,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html","event_timestamp":1483967700,"reply_count":61,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126988124/80318699","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25526982#t25526982","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25526982#t25526982","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25526982#t25526982","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3966214","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1251343251609710/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25526982,"talkid":99714,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25526982#t25526982","upictitle":"Matthew Masterson: pic#126988124","article":"I believe Grover Cleveland killed someone while he was a sheriff in NY.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 9 2017, 20:28:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Grover Cleveland","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1251343251609710/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Matthew Masterson","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3966214","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=80318699&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Matthew Masterson","ctime_ts":1483993721,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124128086/1187157","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25542854#t25542854","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25542854#t25542854","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25542854#t25542854","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dlgood","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dlgood.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25542854,"talkid":99776,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25542854#t25542854","above":25526982,"upictitle":"Dave: Flag","article":"Indeed.

As you might expect in such circumstances, it is difficult to know if Washington actually killed someone, but it would seem highly probable.<br /><br />James Monroe.<br /><br />The Battle of Trenton was the turning point of the American Revolution and James Monroe was one of its greatest heroes. He was badly wounded while conducting an heroic act and would have died had his wound from being shot not been treated quickly and well. Many sources say that he killed one or more Hessians during the battle.<br /><br />Grover Cleveland.<br /><br />He who passes the sentence should pull the trigger. Sheriff Grover Cleveland carried out the death sentence on 3 condemned prisoners.<br /><br />A man of staunch integrity, Cleveland, as Sheriff of Buffalo, carried out 3 orders of execution personally. While the law did not require the Sheriff to personally carry out the execution, Cleveland believed it was his duty.<br /><br />Theodore Roosevelt.<br /><br />TR claimed to have killed men during the Battle of San Juan Hill. One thing that distinguishes Theodore Roosevelt from the other presidents on the list is that he boasted proudly of his \"accomplishments.\"<br /><br />Harry S Truman.<br /><br />Our only president to serve during World War I, Truman’s courage under fire saved the lives of many of his men. His biographer does not record any instance in which Truman was believed to have killed anyone, but, as with any soldier in combat during wartime, it is certainly possible.<br /><br />Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush<br /><br />All of them served during World War II. Given the nature of his assignment, it is very likely that George H. W. Bush killed numerous people while serving as a bomber pilot. He earned his wings as the youngest Navy pilot at the time and all tolled, he flew nearly 60 missions. He was shot down and then rescued and earned his Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. Due to the nature of their assignments, none of the others would have killed anyone.<br /><br />John F. Kennedy: <br /><br />When asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy replied, “It was easy – they sank my boat.” Kennedy’s first brush with the morbidity of war was when his transport ship, taking him to his PT base in the Solomon Islands, was attacked by Japanese airplanes. When the crew tried to rescue an enemy pilot floating in the water, the man started firing at the captain and crew with a pistol. Kennedy admits to having been “Praising the Lord and Passing the ammunition” with the rest of the men. But everyone was too surprised to shoot straight. In the end the pilot was killed by an older sailor with a rifle. Kennedy commanded PT-109. The boat sank when a Japanese destroyer split it in two, apparently while the crew was sleeping. <br /><br />So what is the final total of Presidents who killed someone?<br /><br />Definitively: Monroe, Jackson, Cleveland, T. Roosevelt, G. H. W. Bush<br /><br />Probably: Washington, W. H. Harrison, Taylor, Grant, Kennedy<br /><br />Sources:<br />http://barrybradford.com/how-many-presid<wbr />ents-have-killed-a-man/<br />http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/16<wbr />0144<a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%23sthash\">#sthash</a>.7hIWX2dQ.dpuf","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 9 2017, 20:44:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10100898127212825/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Dan Koifman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3237606","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76546896&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Dan Koifman","ctime_ts":1483994697,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126988151/80318931","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25531078#t25531078","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25531078#t25531078","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25531078#t25531078","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3966229","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10155732433759358/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25531078,"talkid":99730,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25531078#t25531078","upictitle":"Chris Wernecke: pic#126988151","article":"Hey Mr. Martin,<br /><br />Great read!

The first time he was even near anything resembling combat was during the Sakdalista uprising in the Phillipines in '35, and he was at that point already an administrator.<br /><br />JFK's PT boat saw action and probably hit its target more than once or twice, and may well have caused casualties. As JFK was the commander, not the gunner or torpedo firing guy or what have you, I'm not sure if you could say he killed anyone with his own hands. As a particularly lax and substandard commander, the blood of his own men was almost certainly on his hands.<br /><br />US Grant famously led a cavalry charge and operated commandeered enemy artillery in the Mexican-American war. I suspect he was responsible for taking some lives. <br /><br />Harrison saw combat in the Indian Wars. He was politically connected so it's possible that he managed to avoid any heavy action, and he was singled out for command staff when he was 21, but there were two or three years there where he was a junior infantry officer so it's reasonable to assume he may have killed someone.<br /><br />Hayes definitely saw front-line combat. As an officer in the Civil War he personally led nighttime raids on the enemy and was seriously wounded charging an enemy fortification in one of those ridiculous heroic human wave attacks that seem to define so many Civil War strategic plans.<br /><br />Arthur was a quartermaster, never saw real combat. Pierce saw combat but fell off his horse, fainted, got back on his horse, fell off again, got left behind, caught up with his men, tied himself to his horse so he wouldn't fall off and then fainted again. So, if he killed anyone it was probably by accident, while falling on them. <br /><br />Monroe fought in several pivotal battles of the revolutionary war and took a musket ball in the leg for his trouble, so we can probably assume he shot back. <br /><br />Teddy Roosevelt of course charged up San Juan Hill, and we can assume his guns weren't loaded with blanks at the time. Truman commanded an artillery battery in WWII. I don't know if he ever got up close and personal but his unit saw heavy action. <br /><br />McKinley saw action in the Civil War, though he was mainly a logistics officer he did have occasion to fire his gun. Buchanan fought as an enlisted dragoon in the War of 1812. He saw combat and if he didn't take a life, it wasn't for lack of opportunity.<br /><br />Nixon and Johnson were both REMFs.<br /><br />George Bush Sr. fought in 58 aerial engagements in WWII. He got a boatload of medals and if air-to-air or air-to-ground combat counts, he's probably the deadliest president on a personal level.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 9 2017, 20:58:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"yagathai","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"yagathai","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"January 9 2017, 20:59:22 UTC","dname":"yagathai","ctime_ts":1483995513,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/9963724/439663","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25532870#t25532870","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25532870#t25532870","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25532870#t25532870","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"yagathai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25532870,"talkid":99737,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515014.html?thread=25532870#t25532870","above":25532358,"upictitle":"Names Is For Tombstones, Baby: Rocketeer","article":"Oh!
