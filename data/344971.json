{"itemid":1347,"subject":"Heading Down Under","event":"Things are pretty hectic here.&nbsp; A million things to do, and in less than a week, I will be headed off Down Under.\r\n\r\nDetails of my tour have been available for ages on the Appearances page of my website, but I know that some of you never visit my website (bad on you), so in the hopes of avoiding the &quot;why don&#39;t you ever visit X&quot; emails that inevitably seem to turn up whenever I&#39;ve just gotten back from X, let me hit the highlights here for all my fans and Not A Blog readers in Australia (and New Zealand):\r\n\r\nI&#39;M COMING TO AUSTRALIA (and NEW ZEALAND).\r\n\r\nFirst stop will be Brisbane, where I will be appearing at the SUPANOVA convention, November 8 - 10.&nbsp; I will be doing signings, panels, signings, Q&amp;As, signings, maybe a reading, signings, interviews, and signings.&nbsp; It&#39;s a big big convention with lots of cool guests, so I&#39;ll be joined at some of these events by Lena Headey (Queen Cersei), Mark Addy (King Robert), and Jerome Flynn (Bronn) from HBO&#39;s GAME OF THRONES, along with stars from TRUE BLOOD, SPARTACUS, and many other actors and writers.\r\n\r\nThen on to Sydney.&nbsp; On November 11, I will be speaking at the Sydney Opera House.&nbsp; I&#39;m informed that Lena will be on hand as well, along with Michelle Fairley (Lady Catelyn).&nbsp; This will be an interview and Q&amp;A, I believe.&nbsp; I promise not to attempt to sing opera.&nbsp; (<b>&#39;<u><i>Kill the wabbit!&nbsp; Kill the waaaaabit&#39;</i></u></b>).\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, November 13, I will be in Melbourne, appearing that evening for a similiar event at the Wheeler Centre.&nbsp; The sponsors tell me that Michelle will be on hand for that one as well.\r\n\r\nAfterwards it&#39;s on to Adelaide, and another SUPANOVA, November 15-17.&nbsp; As with Brisbane, there will be a full lineup of signings, panels, interviews, and other events.&nbsp; Mark Addy, Jerome Flynn, and Lena Headey are supposed to join me for that one as well.\r\n\r\nFor my fans elsewhere in Australia... I am sorry, but no, I am NOT appearing in Darwin, Townsville, Cairns, Canberra, Hobart, Alice Springs, Perth, Kangaroo Island, or any of the other cool towns and cities in your lovely country.&nbsp; If you want to see me, hear me, or get your book defaced, you will need to travel to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, or Adelaide.&nbsp; You can find my details, and links to the SUPANOVA webpage and other events, on the Appearances page of my website, so get yourself hither if you&#39;d like to buy tickets.&nbsp; Some of these events may sell out.&nbsp; Some may be sold out already.\r\n\r\nLast stop on the trip will be New Zealand.&nbsp; Or, rather, Wellington, where I am scheduled to do a signing at Whitcoulls booksellers at 12:30 on Friday, November 22.&nbsp; That will be my only public appearance in NZ; the rest of our time there will be private.\r\n\r\nParris and I love Australia and New Zealand and have lots of friends there, so we&#39;re looking forward eagerly to returning.&nbsp; (Though I do rather wish it wasn&#39;t coming up so fast, I have so much else to do).\r\n\r\nSee you&nbsp; Down Under.","ditemid":344971,"eventtime":"2013-10-31 10:44:00","props":{"current_mood":"rushed","current_location":"Santa Fe... for now","taglist":"travels, conventions, signings","current_moodid":100,"commentalter":1384674558,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1385764758},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-10-31 16:44:05","anum":139,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html","event_timestamp":1383216240,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124463911/701220","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403467#t18403467","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403467#t18403467","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403467#t18403467","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"13masquerade","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18403467,"talkid":71888,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403467#t18403467","upictitle":"13MAC: 2014decemberphoto","article":"~I wish I was in Australia to see you!~ :)<br /><br />My first son Angelo is in Australia with his little family..Sydney to be exact!~","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"October 31 2013, 17:02:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"~Australia..!~","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"13masquerade","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"13masquerade","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"13masquerade","ctime_ts":1383238928,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121601152/14573387","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403723#t18403723","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403723#t18403723","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403723#t18403723","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"erdbeerrei","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://erdbeerrei.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18403723,"talkid":71889,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403723#t18403723","upictitle":"erdbeerrei: Dany Jorah","article":"Have a save trip!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"October 31 2013, 17:36:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://erdbeerrei.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"erdbeerrei","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"erdbeerrei","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://erdbeerrei.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"erdbeerrei","ctime_ts":1383240981,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/118140407/51274397","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403979#t18403979","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403979#t18403979","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403979#t18403979","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"pkkmr","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://pkkmr.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18403979,"talkid":71890,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/344971.html?thread=18403979#t18403979","upictitle":"Pulak Kumar: pic#118140407","article":"Now all I need to do is ask my parents to get me an Australian visa, sort things out with the consulate, arrange my travel plans, take a leave of absence from college....okay, it isn't particularly great news for me.
