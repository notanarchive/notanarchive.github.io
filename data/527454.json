{"itemid":2060,"subject":"March Madness","event":"No, I'm not talking about basketball.   I'm a football guy, mostly.  A little baseball on the side.   But I don't follow basketball, or hockey, or soccer, or tennis, or golf.\r\n\r\nMy own March has been pretty damned mad, however.   Hard to believe half the month is gone already.\r\n\r\nWe had two great nights at the JCC with Leeman Kessler and ASK LOVECRAFT.  His YouTube videos are a lot of fun, but he's even better in person.  If you have a chance to see him at a con, don't miss it.  Some of his bits are funny, but he also has moments (as HPL) that are moving and profound.\r\n\r\nThe HAP & LEONARD premiere was also terrific.  It's always great to see Joe Lansdale, and the second season of the show looks to be even better than the first.\r\n\r\nAnd of course on Tuesday we brought together the Santa Fe film community up on the hill, and rolled out the Stagecoach Foundation.   That was exciting as well.\r\n\r\n(Though I have to confess, reading some of the various reports about Stagecoach on line makes me want to bang my head against the desk and bewail what passes for journalism in this age of the internet.  Back when I was a journalism student at Northwestern, some of these clowns would have gotten themselves a \"Medill F.\"  They don't even get basic facts right.  mutter mutter mutter)\r\n\r\nBesides all that, there's been the huge new Wild Cards deal, the Wild Cards reread, lots of stuff with HBO that I cannot talk about yet, and of course -- always, always -- WINDS OF WINTER.\r\n\r\nSo much to do.  And the days go by so quickly.  I love my work, all my work, all my projects, all my children, but sometimes it seems as if the harder I work, the further behind I get.\r\n\r\nMaybe things will calm down soon.   But I am not holding my breath.","ditemid":527454,"eventtime":"2017-03-18 15:57:00","props":{"current_mood":"tired","current_location":"Santa Fe ","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, the writing
