{"itemid":1489,"subject":"A Few Words from Switzerland","event":"I can&#39;t give you an exact count... but I must have done at least fifty interviews over the past two months.&nbsp; Maybe as many as a hundred.\r\n\r\nRadio interviews, TV interviews, magazine and newspaper interviews, private interviews, group interviews, public interviews... in France, in Switzerland, in Scotland, in London, in San Diego, and most recently in LA, on the Red Carpet for the Emmys.\r\n\r\nOn some of the foreign trips, I did entire days of interviews.&nbsp; They would park me in a hotel suite, usher in a journalist or a film crew, we&#39;d talk for a half hour, then my hosts would escort that reporter out, and bring in a new one.&nbsp; Some of the journalists were very sharp.&nbsp; Some... ah... weren&#39;t.&nbsp; (A few made me wonder what the hell has happened to the standards of the profession that I once got my degrees in, back at Northwestern.) \r\n\r\nSitting around a hotel room talking doesn&#39;t sound so hard, but it can be grueling.&nbsp; Especially when they all ask the same damn questions.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n(Tyrion is my favorite character. Okay?&nbsp; OKAY?&nbsp; Can we PLEASE put that one to rest??&nbsp; I love all my viewpoint characters, Arya and Sansa and Bran, Jon Snow and Brienne, Arianne and Cersei and Jaime, Theon, even Victarion and the Damphair, ALL of them, but I love Tyrion the bestest.&nbsp; Tyrion son of Tywin, the Imp, second son of Casterly Rock.&nbsp; How many bloody times do I need to say it??&nbsp; I swear, from now on, whenever anybody asks me, &quot;who is you favorite character,&quot; I am going to start naming characters from other people&#39;s books.&nbsp; Cugel the Clever.&nbsp; Flashman.&nbsp; Gatsby.&nbsp; Hotspur.&nbsp; Solomon Kane.&nbsp; A different one each time... )\r\n\r\nBut I digress.\r\n\r\nAnyway... I did the interviews, so I might as well share them as they come up.\r\n\r\nDid a whole bunch in Neuchatel at NIFFF, as I said.&nbsp; Journalists from Switzerland, France, Germany all came.&nbsp; The worst of those.... well, that one most of you have seen, I suspect, it&#39;s the one where I gave the guy the finger.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a much better one, an in-depth piece that actually covers some ground about my life and writing that hasn&#39;t been covered a thousand times before.&nbsp; If that&#39;s of interest to you, you may enjoy it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/song-of-ice-and-fire-author-george-rr-martin-on-success-chess-and-the-wrath-of-superfans-9652448.html","ditemid":381419,"eventtime":"2014-08-30 17:07:00","props":{"current_mood":"drained","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"interviews","current_moodid":40,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1429635213,"opt_lockcomments":1,"ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"torcon","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revtime":1429635252},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-08-30 23:05:57","anum":235,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html","event_timestamp":1409418420,"reply_count":57,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114983018/44811223","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468011#t19468011","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468011#t19468011","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468011#t19468011","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ashayatara","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ashayatara.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19468011,"talkid":76046,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468011#t19468011","article":"I would call the interview where you gave the interviewer the finger the best of the lot, personally.","upictitle":"Ashaya Bailey: pic#114983018","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"2 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"August 30 2014, 23:45:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ashayatara.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ashayatara","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ashayatara","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ashayatara.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ashayatara","ctime_ts":1409442350,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123939386/72141656","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468267#t19468267","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468267#t19468267","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468267#t19468267","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2751215","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/hamwise.lambgee","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19468267,"talkid":76047,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19468267#t19468267","upictitle":"Eric Couchman: pic#123939386","article":"Well obviously Tyrion is your bestest most favourite, everyone knows that.

Not the Big Bang cute nerds, the nerds I knew and loved in school when I was growing up in the 60's and 70's.  :) ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"August 31 2014, 04:23:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dragonborngurl","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dragonborngurl","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"August 31 2014, 04:24:40 UTC","dname":"dragonborngurl","ctime_ts":1409459029,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19470571#t19470571","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19470571#t19470571","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19470571#t19470571","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ddfreese","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ddfreese.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19470571,"talkid":76056,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/381419.html?thread=19470571#t19470571","upictitle":"ddfreese: pic#0","article":"You might tell them \"e,\" cryptographers say it is the most commonly typed letter in the English language.

We found that out when Lord Stark was killed on the orders of twisted boy \"king\" Joffrey. The man that won his most dearest friend the Iron Throne and overcame so many difficulties in his own life to rule as the perfect Lord of Winterfell. Doubtless, most would agree that he was as perfect as a lord could get. But you killed him to make the point that \"anything can happen\". Although it was very sad, I understood your point of view. And I don't think you even know how much your characters influence people. The depth you go into is astonishing.<br /><br />But, as I read on and finished the 5 books eventually, I felt like you were trying to put up the message that \"nobleness and honor only dig your grave\". This is the part that saddens me, because heroes do win sometimes in real life, if not always.<br /><br />Yes, we still have likable centric characters left. We have Tyrion, Snow, Arya and the others. Tyrion most importantly, a good and funny man, not the most honorable. And over the past couple of books Jaime is being portrayed as a \"good man the world never understood\" type of character. <br /><br />Yet, whomever will sit Iron Throne at the end of the day I feel like it will not be \"fair\". Because we will be always left with the thought of how peaceful Westeros could have been if it saw Robb or Eddard as the King.<br /><br />So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, bad things must not always happen to good people. <br /><br />I cut through the \"I love your books and big fan\" part because that doesn't need to be stated. I just wish you liked heroes more than fixed and turned good kind.<br /><br />My apologies if I caused any sort of annoyance or offense in any way.
