{"itemid":1708,"subject":"Ah, My Jet Set Life","event":"We are only one day back from the east coast, having even finished unpacking yet, and yet Spokane and worldcon are only a week away.  Sometimes all this does leave me feeling rather ragged.\r\n\r\nIt was a great trip, though.\r\n\r\nMy nephew Jeffrey and his lady Kristin got married in Bayonne and enjoyed a lovely lively reception in Morristown, and nothwithstanding the fears of some of you out there, no one died at the wedding.  Pigeon pie was not served.  Nor did we dance the Hokey-Pokey, which is unusual for a Jersey wedding, but I am told the marriage counts anyway.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed delightful meals at wonderful restaurants with editors and publishers from Random House, from Tor, and from Simon & Schuster.  Good folks all.  After all the Puppygate craziness of the past few months, it was nice to sit down for a few hours with actual grown-up sane professionals from the real world of publishing, and be reminded what that is like.\r\n\r\nI also went on a pizza crawl of Manhattan and Brooklyn with X-Ray and Raya.  Nothing beats New York City pizza... well, unless it's New Jersey pizza, and maybe New Haven's.  We wimped out, though, and could only manage two pizza places.  But the pies were great.\r\n\r\nAnd we visited the training camp of the New York Jets, and got to visit their war rooms and practice fields, and meet Gang Green's GM and a lot of his staff, plus Nick Mangold and D'brickashaw Ferguson.  We didn't meet Darrelle Revis, but he was there practicing, and it was great to see him back in green and white.  The Jets were great hosts, and who knows, maybe I can make it back later this year for an actual game.\r\n\r\nAnd then of course there was Staten Island, and the showdown between the SI Direwolves and the Lannister Renegades.  Much has been written about that elsewhere, so I won't rehash: google if you want details.  I am pleased to report that the Direwolves won 10-1, so I won't need to kill another Stark.  The team made an incredibly generous contribution to the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary as well.  And I have to say, the field there on Staten Island, right next to the iconic ferry, is the most beautiful I've ever seen, with truly spectacular views.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a great trip.\r\n\r\nIf only there wasn't so much work awaiting me when I came home...","ditemid":437368,"eventtime":"2015-08-11 17:33:00","props":{"current_mood":"tired","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"travels, nfl","current_moodid":31,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1478580322,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Ah, My Jet Set Life http://goo.gl/Nnpjz3","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.700276363164198]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1439336033}","revtime":1439593882},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-08-11 23:33:14","anum":120,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437368.html","event_timestamp":1439314380,"reply_count":102,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/79191470/651442","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437368.html?thread=22253944#t22253944","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437368.html?thread=22253944#t22253944","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437368.html?thread=22253944#t22253944","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"inquisitor77","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://inquisitor77.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22253944,"talkid":86929,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437368.html?thread=22253944#t22253944","upictitle":"Jeremy: Rocket Surgery","article":"George, I'm not sure if you happened to hear the recent news about Geno Smith.

At the same time, it was super fun to stumble upon interviews or pseudo-news articles of your travels and interactions with the Jets.

Because you post your own \"news\" in fuller detail (and better written), I obviously have less issue about how much of your life is on public display. Besides, you Jersey Boys are tough and you know how to battle them media dummies if they get out of line.
