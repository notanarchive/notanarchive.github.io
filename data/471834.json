{"itemid":1843,"subject":"What They Edited","event":"My observations about the Best Editor (Long Form) Hugo, which you can read in full several posts down, have drawn some comments here and on FILE 770 from fans who object to my suggestion that this category has become a de facto lifetime achievement award, at least since David G. Hartwell set an example by withdrawing from future consideration after his third win.\r\n\r\nThe objections seem to take the form of stating emphatically that Best Editor (Long Form) is NOT a lifetime achievement award, it's not, it's not, it's just <i><b>NOT</b></i>. \r\n\r\nAnd quite right they are.  According to the rules, that is.  According to the rules, the award is only supposed to be for the previous year's editing.\r\n\r\nWhich is great in theory, and completely wrong in fact.  Maybe those who are objecting vote on that basis, but if so, they are a very tiny minority.  Given the difficulty of actually knowing who edited what in any particular year, most fans are voting on the basis of lifetime achievement, whether the rules admit that possibility or not.  Or are we really supposed to believe that Ginjer Buchanan finally won in 2014 solely on the basis of the books she edited in 2013, that Betsy Wollheim's win in 2012 was entirely due to her wonderful editing in 2011?  If you believe that, there's a nice bridge in my hometown of Bayonne, New Jersey that you might want to buy.  Ginjer and Betsy won their much-deserved rockets in recognition of their long and distinguished careers, careers that spanned decades, during which time they bought and published hundreds of novels, discovered and nurtured dozens of new writers, helped to shape their lines and by extension the field we all love.  That's what got them their rockets, not -- as we must assume elsewise -- a sudden one-year burst of editorial brilliance.\r\n\r\nThat being said, however, I do recognize that there are those out there who will never agree to this philosophy.  The rules are the rules, they will say, so they will not take career contributions into account, just the previous year.  \r\n\r\nOkay.  We aim to please.  So I emailed some of the editors I'd recommended in my original post, and asked them what books they edited last year.  And a couple of them have replied.\r\n\r\nANNE LESLEY GROELL of Bantam Spectra and Random House.  Besides my own KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS and the GAME OF THRONES coloring book, Anne also edited FOOL'S QUEST by Robin Hobb, UPROOTED by Naomi Novik, GREEN EARTH by Kim Stanley Robinson (an abridged compilation of three books ALG had edited), BOMBS AWAY by Harry Turtledove, THE DARKLING CHILD by Terry Brooks, \"plus a bunch of stuff that will be out this year.\"\r\n\r\nJANE JOHNSON of HarperCollins Voyager in the UK, in addition to my own releases, was also the editor on THE LIAR'S KEY by Mark Lawrence, FOOL'S QUEST by Robin Hobb (the British edition, obviously), and HALF A WORLD and HALF A WAR by Joe Abercrombie.\r\n\r\nSo that's two, for those who want to consider only last year's work.\r\n\r\nSo far only those two editors have responded, but if I get more replies, I will post the titles here.  Whether you favor the \"single year\" or \"lifetime achievement\" approach to this award, I think we can all agree that having some information is to the good.","ditemid":471834,"eventtime":"2016-02-10 17:45:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, awards, editing","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Feb 11 00:44:02 2016]R [Thu Feb 11 00:44:03 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/697581831785295873 ","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1455824386,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/697581831785295873","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.6509299237449]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1455151457}","revtime":1455912331},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-02-11 00:44:01","anum":26,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html","event_timestamp":1455126300,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23986202#t23986202","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23986202#t23986202","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23986202#t23986202","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3448837","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/MaverickMono","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23986202,"talkid":93696,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23986202#t23986202","upictitle":"Samuel Pickstone: pic#0","article":"Hello!

How many books do I read in a given year? How many <i>brand-new</i> books do I read in a given year? I'm not an industry professional; just a genre geek. This year, the number is somewhere around seven. That's with me making an effort for the Hugos; I think in any previous year, that number was zero (excepting possibly years where my very favorite doorstopper fantasy series had a new release). What are the odds of me reading two books, in one year, <i>by the same editor, <b>that I really enjoyed</b></i>? (Maybe if I found a favorite editor, I'd increase my hit-rate? But that seems to me like a fairly non-standard reader profile.)<br /><br />When it comes down to it, <b>what's the value of an award given by fans who don't really know what they're talking about</b>? I don't see any. I think the Hugo category works just fine, as long as you're assuming that the people nominating and voting for it are the people who care enough to have an interest and actually know what they're talking about. But what's the value of appealing to Fandom At Large, saying they <i>should</i> be interested, and encouraging them to nominate and vote even <i>without</i> industry experience and familiarity?<br /><br />I don't want <i>everybody</i> to vote for Best Editor, the same way I don't want everybody who loved <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> to vote on Best Novelette (or one Best President of Tibet, for that matter).<br />I think you're trying to open a path for people who <i>are</i> interested to learn more, become informed, and become able to participate. I appreciate that. But I also don't feel you've managed to open that crack very wide. It's an opaque category for people outside the industry, and I think it's better to admit that than pretend otherwise.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"February 11 2016, 08:55:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/100103750588762627418","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Ziv Wities","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3109140","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=75240686&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Ziv Wities","ctime_ts":1455180902,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23992602#t23992602","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23992602#t23992602","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23992602#t23992602","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23992602#t23992602","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23992602,"talkid":93721,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=23992602#t23992602","above":23989530,"upictitle":"George R.R.

For those who are interested: You've got editing the individual manuscripts; selecting submissions; championing an author within the company (which affects the marketing, design, print run, etc.); working with the author on a professional level; plus a bunch of other stuff, all of which varies depending on the editor and publishing house. An editor might have a light touch on the manuscripts (which are sometimes edited beforehand by the agent), they might encourage plot changes, or they might go as far as turning a standalone novel into a series. And then there's the unmeasurable influence a supportive editor might have on the author's working day when the author knows their book's in good hands.<br /><br />This all basically means it's not really possible to judge an editor for one year's work, since the books that come out one year represent only a fraction of what they do. And the editor doesn't know either if a book will strike a chord with readers until it's been out for a while. (And I haven't touched upon the editors who take care of the backlist or acquire older books to give them new leases of life.)<br /><br />So how do you judge editors? If you like the books they had a hand in publishing, that means the editors were good. Even if you can't compare the draft manuscript to the finished one, you can still judge their choice to publish the book. (Think of how many rejections published authors have had. It took only one editor to take a chance on them.) Plus the editor managed to get it to reach the right reader - you - and that counts for a lot too. If an author stays with the same editor for many of their books, that's a very good sign. As other have said, you can find editors' names by reading the acknowledgements. If an author repeatedly thanks the same editor, there you go. The author would know.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"February 13 2016, 02:02:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bluelark1.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bluelark1","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bluelark1","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bluelark1.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bluelark1","ctime_ts":1455328973,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121999186/66781920","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=24020762#t24020762","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=24020762#t24020762","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=24020762#t24020762","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"levellersteve","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://levellersteve.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24020762,"talkid":93831,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/471834.html?thread=24020762#t24020762","upictitle":"Stephen Richter: pic#121999186","article":"I have brought the attending membership for Helsinki because , one that will be a hell of a party, and two I can keep an eye on this year for my 2017 nomination responsibility.
