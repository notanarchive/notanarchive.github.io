{"itemid":53,"subject":"Weeds On Line","event":"My friend and sometime partner in crime Melinda M. Snodgrass has just launched her new website and blog.  The site can be found at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.melindasnodgrass.com/\r\n\r\nand I encourage all of Melinda's friends to go and check it out and leave a calling card.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who may not be familiar with her work, Melinda has been my assistant editor and right hand on WILD CARDS since the series was first born back in the 1980s.  She was the creator of Dr. Tachyon and Dr. Finn, two of our most popular characters, and has a great new character called Double Helix set to debut in the new Wild Cards book, INSIDE STRAIGHT, that Tor will be publishing next January.  She and I also collaborated on a couple of screenplays back during my Hollywood days -- a WILD CARDS feature film featuring the Turtle and Dr. Tachyon, and an adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic, A PRINCESS OF MARS.  Neither one ever made, alas, but that's the way it goes in Hollywood, and we did get wheelbarrows full of money, so it wasn't all bad.\r\n\r\nSnod also wrote some great television and film all by her lonesome, including the now-classic \"Measure of a Man\" episode of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, some great episodes of REASONABLE DOUBTS and THE PROFILER, and the pilot for STAR COMMAND, her own SF show, which filmed in Germany (ask her about the robot than ran amuck and smashed the set) and should have been picked up for series, but wasn't.  She's written a brand new WILD CARDS feature screenplay as well, and is deep in discussions with various Hollywood studios about getting it optioned and filmed, so cross your fingers.\r\n\r\nShe also has a big new novel coming out from Tor next year.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't be telling you all her news, however.  Give her a visit, say hi on her blog, and you can hear it all first hand.","ditemid":13722,"eventtime":"2007-03-10 10:30:00","props":{"commentalter":1265357801,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-03-10 17:47:58","anum":154,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html","event_timestamp":1173522600,"reply_count":36,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51997339/439663","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html?replyto=1711258","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html?thread=1711258#t1711258","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html?thread=1711258#t1711258","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html?thread=1711258#t1711258","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html?thread=1711258#t1711258","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"yagathai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1711258,"talkid":6684,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/13722.html?thread=1711258#t1711258","upictitle":"Names Is For Tombstones, Baby: Whut?","article":"Waitasec.
