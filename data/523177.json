{"itemid":2043,"subject":"Hugo Thoughts: Best Series","event":"This year a new category has been added to the Hugo Awards: Best Series.\r\n\r\nIt's not a permanent category yet.  Though the idea behind the category has been discussed at various worldcon business meetings over the years, it has yet to be passed and ratified.  But worldcon rules permit each concom to add one category of their own choosing each year, and the Finnish fans decided to add Best Series... rather as an experiment, I guess, to see how well the category might work.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I have mixed thoughts about adding Best Series to the Hugos as a permanent new category.  Being an old guy, I can remember a time when most science fiction novels were stand-alones.  If they were popular enough, they might spawn sequels, but the series novel was the exception rather than the rule.  Today the reverse is true.  It has become increasingly hard to find a science fiction or fantasy novel that is NOT part of some series.   \r\n\r\nSo do we need a Best Series Hugo?  I don't know.  Being part of a series has not stopped the last three Best Novel winners from taking home the rocket, so it is not as if series books are being overlooked.  And what is a \"series,\" actually?  The difficulty of defining that term is one of the reasons so many worldcons have spent so long wrangling over it.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, for this year at least there <i><b>will</b></i> be a Hugo for Best Series.  And I'd guess that almost all the leading contenders for the Best Novel rocket are ALSO contenders for Best Series (yes, there will be a few exceptions).  So the only series that I am going to submit for your consideration is one that will NOT also be competing for The Big One: my own.\r\n\r\nNo, not <i>that </i>one.  A SONG OF ICE & FIRE had no new installment published in 2016, so it's not eligible.  Besides, I don't consider A SONG OF ICE & FIRE to be a series, not as I define the word (yes, I am aware, the rules define the term more broadly).  I consider A SONG OF ICE & FIRE to be one single gigantic story published in multiple volumes.  (Seven, I hope).  LORD OF THE RINGS was not a series either, nor a trilogy; it was a single novel published in three volumes.\r\n\r\nBut I <i><b>do </b></i>have a series, a true series, one that I've been working on even longer than I have ICE & FIRE, one that I am very proud of: WILD CARDS.  \r\n\r\nYou know.  This series here:\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/430612/430612_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/430869/430869_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/425399/425399_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/425685/425685_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/425835/425835_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/425990/425990_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/426284/426284_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/426571/426571_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/426787/426787_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/427226/427226_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/427477/427477_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/427720/427720_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/427844/427844_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/428191/428191_300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/428523/428523_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/428547/428547_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/429055/429055_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/429120/429120_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/429491/429491_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/429742/429742_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/429932/429932_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/430095/430095_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/430566/430566_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nWILD CARDS is no stranger to Hugo competition.  In 1988, when the series was only three books old, the New Orleans worldcon added a new category called \"Other Forms,\" just as Helsinki has added Best Series, and we were one of the five nominees.  We lost to Alan Moore's landmark graphic novel WATCHMEN, which surprised no one, least of all us... but it WAS an honor just to be nominated, and we had a great time at the Hugo Losers Party afterward.   \r\n\r\nAlas, \"Other Forms\" did not survive as a Hugo category, and the Wild Cards books, though they continued to be popular, never fit comfortably into any of the other categories.  We called them mosaic novels, and some were indeed six- or seven-way collaborative novels, but they were never going to contend for Best Novel.  Other volumes were more akin to anthologies... but the Hugo Awards have never had a 'Best Anthology' category (though if truth be told, I'd sooner see them add that than Best Series).  I would sometimes get some votes for my editing, but never enough to make the final ballot (one year I finished seventh out of five, as I recall, but that was the closest I came).  Individual stories from the books were nominated for awards and one such, Walter Jon Williams \"Witness,\" was a Nebula finalist.  That lost too.  Oh, and one year S.P. Somtow presented Wild Cards with his Icarus Award.   \r\n\r\nI can hardly be objective about WILD CARDS, but I do think we're worthy of consideration. This year we are celebrating our thirtieth anniversary, a considerable achievement all by itself.  All the other shared world series of the 80s are gone, but Wild Cards continues... and I think that most of those who have stuck with us over the years will agree, we're better than ever.  We have entertained millions of readers over those three decades, the books have been published in the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Russia, Germany, Brazil (with more countries coming up).  WILD CARDS has given birth to two role-playing games, two comic book series (three more graphic novels in the works), and soon, I hope, a television series.   We've had twenty-three books published to date, three more finished and delivered and in the pipeline for publication in 2017 and 2018, more to come.\r\n\r\nBut it's not just longevity.  Together with WATCHMEN, WILD CARDS helped redefine the treatment of superpowers and superheroes in popular culture, taking a grittier, more realistic, more adult approach to the subject, with an emphasis on characterization.  And with the full mosaics we only dared attempt every third book, we went way beyond any other shared world to create a whole new (and very demanding, I may add) template.  And there's been some cool world-building too, as my team played the alternate world concept central to the series.\r\n\r\nWe have had ups and downs, of course -- hey, with twenty-three books and a couple hundred stories, how not? -- but overall, I don't know many other series that have maintained a similar consistencey of quality over half as many book, and I like to think that when we've been good, we've been very very good.  Especially in those full mosaics: JOKERS WILD, ACE IN THE HOLE/ DEAD MAN'S HAND, DEALER'S CHOICE, BLACK TRUMP, SUICIDE KINGS, HIGH STAKES.  \r\n\r\nI've only been a small part of that, of course.  I may the conductor, but I've had a hell of a band.  Over the decades, I've had the honor of working with some truly gifted and innovative writers.  Howard Waldrop, Roger Zelazny, Daniel Abraham, Edward Bryant, Stephen Leigh, Victor Milan, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Carrie Vaughn, Laura J. Mixon, Sage Walker, William F. Wu, John Jos. Miller, Lewis Shiner, Cherie Priest, Walton Simons, Caroline Spector, Walter Jon Williams, Michael Cassutt, Paul Cornell, Ian Tregillis, David Anthony Durham, David D. Levine... the list goes on and on... and of course, Melinda M. Snodgrass, who has been my right hand since the start.  \r\n\r\nAnd wait till you see the new writers we have in store for you in the books to come, and the characters they've created for us.  The best, truly, is yet to come.\r\n\r\nWILD CARDS.  Best Series?  That's up to fandom.  If you've liked the books, nominate them.  But once again let me say that whatever you choose to nominate, you should <b><span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">NOMINATE</span></b>. \r\n\r\n((If you haven't read any Wild Cards and would like to try a small sample before shelling out for a book, check out the FREE stories on Tor.com)).  \r\n\r\nClear skies and tail winds.","ditemid":523177,"eventtime":"2017-02-27 18:27:00","props":{"current_mood":"productive","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, wild cards, worldcon, awards","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Feb 28 01:27:01 2017]R [Tue Feb 28 01:27:02 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/836387197930569728 ","current_moodid":89,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1488504502,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/836387197930569728","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.616425923522113]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1488245234}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2043?v=1488843156","revtime":1488843151},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-02-28 01:26:59","anum":169,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html","event_timestamp":1488220020,"reply_count":15,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/46721543/2854335","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25775785#t25775785","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25775785#t25775785","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25775785#t25775785","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kalimac","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kalimac.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25775785,"talkid":100686,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25775785#t25775785","etime_ts":"1488250999","article":"The Mythopoeic Society Awards have tried for years to draw the distinction you're drawing between true series and a single story told in multiple volumes.  The former, in which the volumes stand alone, are eligible individually; the latter only when they're finished.  (This, incidentally, is why no volume of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> has been nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award: we're waiting for it to be completed.  When it is, I don't doubt it'll be a finalist.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, many Society members, who are allowed to nominate, interpret the \"if it doesn't stand alone, it isn't eligible individually\" to refer to any connection between books, which was not the intent.  When Marion Zimmer Bradley died, someone tried to nominate the entirety of Darkover.  I was awards administrator then, and disallowed this: Darkover was a series, not a single story in multiple volumes.<br /><br />However, the Hugos take a different approach, and don't differentiate between the two.  They certainly don't have the deferral-of-books if they don't stand alone that the Mythopoeic Awards have.  When the Hugos had a one-shot Best Series before, in 1966, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, the nominee the category was intended to honor, was a single book in multiple volumes.  Three of the other nominees - Barsoom, the Lensmen series, and Heinlein's Future History - were clearly series.  The actual winner, Asimov's Foundation, was somewhere in between.","upictitle":"Kalimac: puzzle","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"2 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"February 28 2017, 03:02:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kalimac.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kalimac","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kalimac","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kalimac.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"February 28 2017, 03:03:19 UTC","dname":"kalimac","ctime_ts":1488250963,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25776297#t25776297","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25776297#t25776297","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25776297#t25776297","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25776297,"talkid":100688,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523177.html?thread=25776297#t25776297","above":25775785,"upictitle":"George R.R.

If a character were to have a power that could explore different worlds in different times - say, ancient peoples, \"medieval\" settings, myths and folklore - I'd never get enough of it. That said, from what I've read, it certainly deserves being nominated a hundred times over. It seems to be George's favourite baby, and I can't blame him! Good luck, Mr. Martin.

TWOT is effectively my foundation or anchor into SF&F fandom.  TWOT was so popular among fans that Usenet basically had to split off the fandom for Robert Jordan into a new newsgroup because the volume of topics regarding TWOT was overwhelming the rec.arts.sf.written group.  They have sold 80+ million books worldwide.  The comparable for the discussion about Jon Snow's parents is \"Who Killed Asmodean?\" from TWOT, which perplexed fans for over a decade of crazy theories.  Despite all of this, none of the individual books were ever in the finals for a Best Novel Hugo.  Even last year if you took off the puppy picks the Companion book would not have even qualified for related work.<br /><br />In 2014 TWOT was nominated as a series in the Best Novel category.  It lost to every non-puppy nominee.  In fact, it got the highest percentage of \"No Award\" votes of a non-puppy book in the last 5 years:<br /><br />2014 - 4th place - TWOT<br />Award - 1632 (%65)<br />No Award - 860 (%35)<br /><br />2013 - 5th Place - Blackout<br />Award - 948 (%81)<br />No Award - 224 (%19)<br /><br />2012 - 5th Place - A Dance with Dragons<br />Award - 1014 (%84)<br />No Award - 194 (%16)<br /><br />2011 - 5th Place - The Dervish House<br />Award - 1098 (%90)<br />No Award - 117 (%10)<br /><br />2010 - 5th Place - Palimpest<br />Award - 464 (%81)<br />No Award - 108 (%19)<br /> <br />I am hopeful that something like a Series award will give a place for works like this to be awarded and look forward to what happens this year.
