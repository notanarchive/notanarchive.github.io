Which I will not be able to attend, alas.  I'd hoped to... the last WFC in Saratoga was great fun, and I loved the city, and the train ride up the Hudson from NYC... but the press of work, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the full ballot, go here:  http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/258883/258883_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/259327/259327_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n(I would be surprised if ROGUES actually won.  It's up against some strong competition, including an anthology by my dear friend Ellen Datlow, and \"Never get between Ellen Datlow and a World Fantasy Award\" is right up their with \"Never get in a land war in Asia\" and \"Never play poker with a man named Doc\" where life's truisms are concerned.

The competition, \"The JOM (Journal of Metals) Top Ten Greatest Works of Material Fiction Revealed,\" was voted on by the top Metallurgists and material scientists throughout the world.  As you have several excellent metallurgical references and the fact that \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" is the best fiction around, IMHO, A Game of Thrones made the cut.
