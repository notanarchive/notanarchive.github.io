I was not happy about the results of the midterm, needless to say... and I am even less happy, if possible, about this \"compromise\" that Obama has made with the GOP on taxes.  From where I sit, it smells more like capitulation than compromise.  Give a lot, get almost nothing.\r\n\r\nObama is the most intelligent president we've had since Jimmy Carter... and, sad to say, he is looking more and more like Jimmy every day.  A good man, but not a good leader.  At least not so far.  He doesn't seem to have the stomach for a fight.  We need another FDR, another JFK, another LBJ.  NOT Jimmy II.  (And, yes, I know, Obama has accomplished some important stuff.  But so did Jimmy.

pic#0","article":"The compromise was the smartest thing Obama has done since he was in office.<br /><br />There is a fixed amount of money out there, if you're in favor of higher taxes you inherently must believe that that money would do more good in the hands of the government rather than in the hands of private individuals and businesses. If you really believe government spends money efficiently I have a $10,000 toilet seat to show you. Even if you believe Obama's own math his stimulus bill spent hundreds of thousands of dollars PER job it created or saved. That is if you believe his math.<br /><br />Furthermore, when these tax cuts were first enacted the federal government actually had an INCREASE in tax receipts, they made more money, despite lower rates, because the lower tax rates spurred economic growth.<br /><br />The 700 billion cost of this package, as such, is static accounting. It assumes that the money will go out and be stuffed under a mattress and not used in the economy. We know that won't happen, and in the end these extensions (don't call them cuts, they're not) will probably pay for themselves through higher economic growth. <br /><br />If you don't want to help out millionaires and billionaires, well. I die a little inside everytime Obama says that. My taxes would have gone up, I am not a millionaire. I have a 10 year old chevy, and my wife drives a 5 year old saturn. Our house is 2200 square feet. We do have both HBO and Showtime, and an HD TV, are we that luxurious? That kind of talk, \"billionaires and millionaires\" is pure hyperbole.<br /><br />The fact is, the top 5% of earners in this country pay 80% of the federal tax burden. So, if that isn't \"fair\" enough for you, what is the fair share? 100%? <br /><br />The bottom 40% of people pay 0 net income taxes. Did you know that? I worry about what happens if that gets to 50%, what if 50% of people in a country do not pay to support the government? (yes, they would still pay sales and property taxes to support local and state governments). If you pay no money to support the federal budget, why would you bother electing a politician who controls spending? I worry about that trend.<br /><br />If you just don't like the inequalities that our meritocracy has produced, you can't tax the rich into pauperhood or somehow help the poor by harassing business owners. The metaphor would be beating someone with a stick while screaming \"Hire someone, expand your business, buy equipment.\" You can't force equality in our system of government or in a free economy. If you want forced equality, it exists in some pretty bad places I'm sure you're glad you don't live in.<br /><br /><br /><br />One thing not mentioned often is the dividend and capital gains tax rates. Had a deal not been reached it would have literally crashed the stock market, which affects everyone with a pension, a retirement account, as well as most nonprofit foundations, school endowments, etc. The image of a stock market investor as only the rich is old fashioned.<br /><br />If the taxes would have been allowed to rise everyone who had a gain in a stock or any other asset would basically get a 10% bonus for selling it in the next couple weeks. All that selling pressure would have tanked things pretty hard. <br /><br />Additionally, you know in your heart of hearts that when you tax something you get less of it. Thats why liberals like gas taxes and carbon taxes and fatty food taxes even now. So what happens when you tax investment? You get less of it. <br /><br />Do we really want less investment in our economy? Will that create jobs? <br /><br />IMO the only bad thing is the unemployment benefit extension. 3 years is not a temporary measure. It is welfare masquerading as a job program, the system is abused and gamed every day. Even Paul Krugman, the nobel prize winning economist (and liberal) of the New York Times has written that such long unemployment benefits create a disincentive for people to find work. <br /><br />Sorry I wrote a book, I'm tired of my non-millionaire self being demagoged for thinking lower taxes will boost the economy (note, even Obama says they will).<br /><br />I will agree with you on one thing. Sarah Palin is poison, I hope she sticks to TV and stays out of washington. <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"December 15 2010, 23:49:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Actually","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dalimar2.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dalimar2","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dalimar2","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dalimar2.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dalimar2","ctime_ts":1292456994,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/113360400/6068569","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188615.html?thread=11509191#t11509191","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188615.html?thread=11509191#t11509191","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188615.html?thread=11509191#t11509191","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188615.html?thread=11509191#t11509191","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"malegrim","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://malegrim.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11509191,"talkid":44957,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188615.html?thread=11509191#t11509191","above":11506631,"upictitle":"Dausuul: pic#113360400","article":"\"Furthermore, when these tax cuts were first enacted the federal government actually had an INCREASE in tax receipts, they made more money, despite lower rates, because the lower tax rates spurred economic growth.\"<br /><br />In what bizarre reality are you living?
