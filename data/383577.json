Giant men, hard as rocks, stamina and strength like no others.  Our gladiators.  They should be confident and chivalrous.  But instead I see abuse of the tiny woman.  The NFL made a terrible mistake trying to hide this.  Giving Ray Rice a 2 game suspension was the last straw for me.  Then they lied about seeing the video.  This is terrible.  My ex-husband was an wife-abuser who loved football.  Write an open letter to the NFL.  Tell them how stupid it is to hide abuse.  Tell them you will boycott for one season.
