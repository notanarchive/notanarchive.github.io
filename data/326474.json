And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting.  So I suspect that he will turn out to be a wonderful Red Viper.<br /><br />I do know that David and Dan and HBO do favor having a racially and ethnically diverse cast on the series.  It is true that we've lost several black characters who appear in the novels (Chataya and Alayaya, Jalabhar Xho, Strong Belwas), but to balance that, characters like Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, both white in the books, have been played by black actors.  Missandei as well, though in the books the Naathi are golden-skinned, not white.<br /><br />As for the Dornishmen, well, though by and large I reject one to one analogies, I've always pictured the \"salty Dornish\" as being more Mediterranean than African in appearance; Greek, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, etc.  Dark hair and eyes, olive skin.  Pedro Pascal is Chilean.  (Check out Amok's version of the Red Viper, that's how I saw him.  Or Magali Villenueve's beautiful and sexy portrait of Princess Arianne).  <br /><br />When and if the show introduces Prince Oberyn's daughters, the Sand Snakes, I expect we will see the same diversity as in the books, ranging from Tyene (blond and blue-eyed) to Sarella (light brown skin, as her mother was a Summer Islander).  And I expect that the crew of the CINNAMON WIND will all be cast with black actors... assuming, of course, that Sam's voyage remains in the story.

That, plus I'm basically locked into an ever-growing All Things Ice & Fire collection (the books in hard and soft covers, the miniatures, the comics/GN's, the Dunk & Egg stories & GN's...)  Pretty much anything that isn't as expensive as the Valyarian Steel replicas, really.  Or the stuff in the HBO store, which sadly doesn't seem to be available in Canada.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"July 2 2013, 16:30:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1372782634,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121368148/65265939","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326474.html?thread=17861962#t17861962","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326474.html?thread=17861962#t17861962","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326474.html?thread=17861962#t17861962","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326474.html?thread=17861962#t17861962","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2048887","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/colin.mc.142","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17861962,"talkid":69773,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326474.html?thread=17861962#t17861962","upictitle":"Colin Mc: pic#121368148","article":"Hey I just wanted to say that I love your books and personally I think that when it comes to creating characters you are unparalleled. I bring this up to show my appreciation for the hours of joy you have given me, and because theres another group doing work that hit me just as hard as did that thing in A dance with dragons. You know the one. The Walking Dead by telltale games is on of the finest examples of storytelling I have ever seen, and I am begging you to ask telltale to make a game of thrones game. I would reccomend you play the games, as they are short, but you are most likely incredbily busy. I know this all seems somewhat pandering but screw it, if theres a chance you check out the walking dead because of this then I feel we will have one of the best storytelling experiences in any media and I say that without restraint.
