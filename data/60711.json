{"itemid":237,"subject":"One and One","event":"I figured the Giants were going to have a tough game today against the Redskins.  Divisional games are always intense, the Skins have a hard-hitting defense, the G-Men were coming off this huge Plax-shoots-himself distraction, and Washington figured to be sky high off the Sean Taylor anniversary and his induction into their Ring of Honor.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I figured the Jets would win easily.  They were at home, the weather figured to help their running game and hamper the Bronco aerial attack, Denver hasn't been able to stop the run all season, and the Jets had just defeated two much tougher teams in New England and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nShow what I know.\r\n\r\nOr, as Chris Berman likes to say, \"that's why they play the games.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one and one alright, but just the reverse of the way I had it.  Total domination by the Giants, but the Jets got embarassed on both sides of the ball.  The only good moment in the Jets game was the amazing Thomas Jones roll-over-a-defender-bounce-up-again-and-score touchdown, which had to be seen to be believed.","ditemid":60711,"eventtime":"2008-11-30 19:26:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":196,"current_moodid":6,"commentalter":1228603446,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-12-01 02:35:37","anum":39,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/60711.html","event_timestamp":1228073160,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/60711.html?replyto=4754471","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/60711.html?thread=4754471#t4754471","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/60711.html?thread=4754471#t4754471","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/60711.html?thread=4754471#t4754471","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"proudbronco","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://proudbronco.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4754471,"talkid":18572,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/60711.html?thread=4754471#t4754471","article":"This is easily the most schizophrenic Broncos team I've ever seen.

As good as Hixon has been he'll need to prove to be even better if teams are going to game plan for him. Pierce did not sound or look his normal confident self in post game Q & A. He and Bradshaw are going to have a difficult week or two. I'm extremely concerned about the Eagles... and the Cowboys. As for Plax... possible three year mandatory incarceration if convicted. Seeing that it was a 4th degree possession, he may get less (not sure). While he has hired the same lawyer who got Diddy off, the situation is quite different as there is no other fall guy, the gun is his and has been confiscated.<br /><br />The Jets... paul maguire... Oh, say it ain't so. The play would have been truly memorable had they won. I seem to remember other plays like it in the past. I could be wrong.
