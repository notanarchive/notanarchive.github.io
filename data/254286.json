We're itching to get back to it again, but this time we'll try to play when we're awake and more alert. :-)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"December 18 2011, 16:53:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"infinite_hiatus","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"infinite_hiatus","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"infinite_hiatus","ctime_ts":1324227219,"tracked":0}]}
