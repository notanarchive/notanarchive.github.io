{"itemid":1706,"subject":"One More Day","event":"Last day at home.  Tomorrow Parris and I fly east for the wedding, and some time in NYC with my agents and editors, and the baseball game on Staten Island (Go Direwolves!).  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the last, I am told tickets are almost sold out, so if you want to come, snag some now.  The first 2500 fans at the stadium will get Direwolf hats.  The first 400 in line will be able to get an autograph.  Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary will be there as well, with one of their \"envoy\" wolves, and there will be a fund-raising raffle for the player jerseys.\r\n\r\nWhile I love travel, I hate getting ready to travel.  The last day at home is always stressful.  Too much to do.\r\n\r\nI won't be blogging much, or reading email, while on the road, so I expect this space will go silent for a week or so.  Don't worry, that doesn't mean the Puppies got me.\r\n\r\nOh, and to be sure, time is running short for that Hugo vote as well.  Balloting closes on July 31.  Once again, to vote get your PIN and go to:\r\n\r\n            http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/voting/\r\n\r\nRemember, he who hesitates is lost.\r\n\r\nOh, before I forget... for those of you still in New Mexico, be sure and swing by the Jean Cocteau Cinema on Monday, August 3 for one of our famous (infamous) author events.  Wild Cards stalwart VICTOR MILAN (creator of Cap'n Trips) will be on hand to read and sign copies of DINOSAUR LORDS, the first volume of his new epic fantasy series.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/265675/265675_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nHey, knights riding dinosaurs, what could be cooler than that?\r\n\r\nCome join Vic and the gang, grab your copy of DINOSAUR LORDS... another great TOR book... and make him sign some Wild Cards books as well.
