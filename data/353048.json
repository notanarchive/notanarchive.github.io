{"itemid":1379,"subject":"The Wolves Are Coming","event":"Arya Stark may have been parted from her direwolf Nymeria, but come Monday in Santa Fe she&#39;ll be meeting two new wolves.\r\n\r\nMaisie Williams won&#39;t be the only guest at Monday&#39;s GAME OF THRONES marathon session at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.&nbsp; Our friends from the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary down in Candy Kitchen will be on hand as well, and they&#39;ll be bringing two of their &quot;wolf ambassadors&quot; to meet Maisie and the fans.\r\n\r\nParris and I have long been supporters of the Sanctuary, dedicated to the rescue of abandoned and abused wolves and wolf-dog hybrids.&nbsp; They do great work.&nbsp; You can find out more about them at http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors will not be members of the new &#39;Westeros Pack,&#39; since those wolves are still a bit too wild and unsocialized to mingle with the public in an uncontrolled environment.&nbsp; They won&#39;t be direwolves either, alas, for the direwolves are all gone (for now).&nbsp; But I think they are bringing Flurry, and he&#39;s almost direwolf sized, and a real charmer to boot.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re expecting a huge turnout for Monday&#39;s marathon session.&nbsp; The show starts at 7:00 pm, and the doors open at 6:00, but people will be lining up by early morning, if the past two weeks are any indication.&nbsp; The Cocteau has only 125 seats, so not everyone will be able to get in... but Maisie and the wolves should both be arriving early, to meet some of the fans in the line.&nbsp; So even if you are not one of the lucky 125 to get into the theatre, you may be able to say hi to Arya and a couple of members of her pack.\r\n\r\nOh, and this week we&#39;re screening episodes six, seven, and eight from season one -- &quot;A Golden Crown,&quot; &quot;You Win And You Die,&quot; and &quot;The Pointy End.&quot;\r\n\r\nSee you at the cinema.","ditemid":353048,"eventtime":"2014-01-16 23:29:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1391123237,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1390939627},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-01-17 06:29:27","anum":24,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html","event_timestamp":1389914940,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/44415920/10021576","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18616344#t18616344","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18616344#t18616344","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18616344#t18616344","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"abomvubuso","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://abomvubuso.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18616344,"talkid":72720,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18616344#t18616344","article":"Can't wait for the pics of Flurry and the rest of the direwolfling pack! :)","upictitle":"Kol: Over the Edge","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"3 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"January 17 2014, 07:36:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://abomvubuso.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"abomvubuso","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"abomvubuso","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://abomvubuso.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"abomvubuso","ctime_ts":1389944168,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124413538/62349884","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18617112#t18617112","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18617112#t18617112","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18617112#t18617112","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"clarctos","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://clarctos.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18617112,"talkid":72723,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353048.html?thread=18617112#t18617112","upictitle":"clarctos: monterey","article":"So freaking fantastic to hear the magnificent line-up for Monday night!
