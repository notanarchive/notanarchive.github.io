{"itemid":169,"subject":"Cough Cough Cough","event":"Sorry I haven't posted lately.  Haven't done much of anything this past week except (1) cough, (2) watch the NFL draft, (3) hack up phlegm, (4) cough some more.\r\n\r\nJust saw my doc.  Looks like I have bronchitis.  Got an RX for some antibiotics that should take care of it.  But I probably won't be blogging much in the next week or so.  What little energy I do have will be used for work.\r\n\r\nLater, guys.","ditemid":43487,"eventtime":"2008-04-29 11:08:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":79,"opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":82,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-04-29 17:18:53","anum":223,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43487.html","event_timestamp":1209467280,"reply_count":0}
