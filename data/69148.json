{"itemid":270,"subject":"Wow","event":"Great Superbowl.  I had no strong rooting interest this year, but this game was still a treat for any fan of the NFL brand of football.  As exciting as last year's game, if not as well played, with several incredible plays that will live in Superbowl lore.  Both teams played valiantly, and those last few minutes no doubt stopped a few hearts.\r\n\r\nI did think the officiating was lacking.  The NFL really needs to do a better job than this.  Far too many penalties, many of them with major impact on the game, and some of them bogus (on both teams).  I wish the refs would learn to keep their flags in their pockets unless they are SURE.  Close calls should not draw flags.\r\n\r\nEven so... a terrific game, one for the ages.  Congratulations to the Pittsburgh Steelers and their fans.  (And to the Pottsville Maroons and THEIR fans.  Rest easy, guys, your curse is still intact).  \r\n\r\nBest half-time show in Superbowl history as well.  BRUUUUUUUCE!  For a moment there I thought he was going to play for three hours, and screw the time limits.  Superbowl halftimes have gotten a lot better of late.  Last year we got Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  Before that it was the famous wardrobe malfunction... but hey, even that was better than Up With People, as in decades of yore.  And I'm so old I remember the marching bands that performed at halftime at SuperBowl I.\r\n\r\n(And being old, I got a little annoyed during the trophy presentation, when Dan Patrick said that the Steeler's sixth Superbowl win made them \"the winningest franchise in NFL history.\"  Uh, no, not even close.  Sorry, Dan, but NFL history goes back half a century before the first Superbowl, and those championships count too.  The Steelers have six, and that's great for them, but I believe the Chicago Bears still have the most NFL championships total, and the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants are up there too).\r\n\r\nAnd so another NFL season comes to a close.\r\n\r\nBut the NFL never really ends.\r\n\r\nThe Detroit Lions are now on the clock.","ditemid":69148,"eventtime":"2009-02-01
