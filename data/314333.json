{"itemid":1227,"subject":"DVDs Set Sales Records","event":"Here I am talking about GAME OF THRONES in the Hugos, and I realize that I have forgotten to mention that season two has just been released on DVD and Blu-Ray.\r\n\r\nWell, yes, it has.  It went on sale Tuesday.  There was even a Monday midnight madness event in NYC, at the Best Buy at Union Square (which I almost dropped in on, as I was on my way from Boston to DC at the time, but Certain People would not let me off the Acela).  They had a direwolf ice sculpture and everything.\r\n\r\nAnd the sets are selling sales records too, I am told.  Says so here:\r\n\r\nhttp://insidetv.ew.com/2013/02/22/game-of-thrones-dvd-sales-breaking-hbo-records/\r\n\r\nHBO has done its usual bang-up job on these.  Besides the episodes themselves, there's all kinds of extra goodies: audio commentaries, histories, interviews, round tables, deleted scenes, dragon's eggs.  Also, several of the big retailers are offering special sets with exclusive content.  The Best Buy sets have heraldic packaging and content no one else has, the Target boxes have stuff exclusive to Target, I think maybe there's some exclusive Amazon stuff too, not sure.  (Yes, I can hear the obsessive completists groaning.  I feel your pain, guys).\r\n\r\nSo if you haven't gotten your Blu-Rays yet, go ye forth and haul ye arse.","ditemid":314333,"eventtime":"2013-02-24 17:16:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1362145189,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1362291738},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-02-25 00:16:09","anum":221,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/314333.html","event_timestamp":1361726160,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/48365295/584816","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/314333.html?thread=17299421#t17299421","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/314333.html?thread=17299421#t17299421","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/314333.html?thread=17299421#t17299421","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"justjohn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://justjohn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17299421,"talkid":67575,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/314333.html?thread=17299421#t17299421","etime_ts":"1361766664","article":"... and watched it in two nights.
