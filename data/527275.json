{"itemid":2059,"subject":"Stagecoach Rolls Out","event":"Now it can be told.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday everybody who is anybody in the Santa Fe film community gathered up the hill at the former headquarters of the Daylight Chemical Information Systems for the official rollout of the Stagecoach Foundation, dedicated to bring more film and television production to the City Different and the Land of Enchantment.  We're very excited.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/438731/438731_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/439971/439971_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nStagecoach will be a non-profit foundation.  Our dream is to bring more jobs to the people of Santa Fe, and to help train the young people of the city for careers in the entertainment industry, through internships, mentoring, and education.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, before airplanes, before railroads, it was the stagecoachs that brought people to Santa Fe.   Our hope is that Stagecoach will do the same.\r\n\r\nAnd none of this would be possible without the generosity and visions of the late David Weininger, who passed away in November... but whose legacy will live on.","ditemid":527275,"eventtime":"2017-03-16 15:31:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"charity, santa fe, television and

you draw upon or reference Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power in the plot construction, especially in the development of my favorite villain of all time, Lord Petyr Baelish? I recently read The 48 Laws and saw so many uncanny parallels with the workings of power in the books, esp. with Littlefinger.<br /><br />Relatedly: Please give us at least one Baelish point-of-view chapter before the end.
