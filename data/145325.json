So I would have asked something along the lines of his involvement with Cyanide, what sorts of things were they looking at incorporating, what about Cyanide appealed to him, etc.  Or how about, \"What would you like to see in the game\" or anything like that.<br /><br />Even if GRRM knows nothing of the game itself, no contact with Cyanide, etc., there are still questions you can ask... What he thinks will come of it, what he'd like to see, if he'd like to maybe do a voice in the game, who's voice would he want to be, or if he'd like to have an NPC that looks like him, if he anticipates any Dunk and Egg content, etc.  All sorts of questions regarding the game should have been asked.  I would have had a hard time narrowing down the number of questions.  But no, nothing.  It just seems really odd to me that a gaming site would not ask anything about the game currently being made.  They simply must not have known, and that's a shame.<br /><br />But yeah, the insight on creating characters was indeed interesting.  NPCs can be very much like characters you read in a book, so it was certainly relevant.  However, take it a step further and ask if Cyanide had mentioned any ideas on what characters they were most interested in for the I&F game, if he was going to have any say so in the NPC characters' dialogue, etc.  It's just mind boggling to me I guess.<br /><br />I play video games off and on, off right now, and if I had a site dedicated to games, and had the opportunity to interview GRRM, if I didn't already know about the game, then I would have found out when doing some basic research.  I think Wikipedia has something about the game.<br /><br />It's like... a potential scoop, or some insight, that was totally missed.  I don't think anything has been mentioned about the game since it was announced that Cyanide obtained a license.  That was about a year ago.  Next time GRRM decides to give an interview to a gaming entity, I hope he says something along the lines of, \"By the way, there is an I&F video game being made\" which should get their dogs barking. :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 6 2010, 20:00:19 UTC","parent":9592237,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://the12judge.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"the12judge","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"the12judge","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://the12judge.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"the12judge","ctime_ts":1270584019,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/99652859/8141487","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145325.html?replyto=9599149","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145325.html?thread=9599149#t9599149","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145325.html?thread=9599149#t9599149","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145325.html?thread=9599149#t9599149","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"terrestrialboy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://terrestrialboy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9599149,"talkid":37496,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/145325.html?thread=9599149#t9599149","above":9596077,"upictitle":"terrestrialboy: gaming rpg superhero comics canada","article":"Well, to be clear, our show is mainly about tabletop gaming, such as card games, board games, and role-playing games, not video games.  Now, given, we do talk about video games on occasion, but 99% of our material is all about the pen-and-paper, tabletop hobby.<br /><br />In the limited amount of time I had to speak with Mr. Martin, I wanted to focus on topics close to the tabletop worls, and his creative process in general.  I figured that any information about the video game (which, other than the content of GRRM's post about is in June of 2009, amounts to two sentences on Wikipedia.  I felt it wasn't important enough to touch on, as video game development takes a long time, and considering Cyanide obtained the license less than a year ago.<br /><br />But, hey, to each their own.<br /><br />Oh, and we have three dogs and two cats.
