In the next couple of months I will be hitting the San Diego Comicon, the World SF Convention in Reno, Nevada, and Bubonicon in Albuquerque.  There will be ample opportunity to have me sign stuff at all three events.  And a lot more time to hang around and talk at any of 'em.  Bubonicon is especially good for that, since it's very small and friendly.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Albuquerque...

Lots of good reads are available from so many of the WILD CARDS writers this post would be a list of dozens of titles if I didn't control myself. If you haven't tried Melinda Snodgrass' \"EDGE' series, or Daniel's quartet, THE LONG PRICE or his newest novel THE DRAGON'S PATH, you'll find a lot of damn fine stories to enjoy by other members of the WC consortium. Oh! Did I mention that the collaborative novel by Daniel and Ty Franck, written under the name 'James S A Corey', LEVIATHAN WAKES will be out this summer as well? No? Well, let me urge you to give it a try - it's 'SF space opera' at its finest.<br /><br />So bring your WILD CARDS books collection and if you haven't already bought them, pick up some of the new titles in the series in the Dealers room to get signed to add to your collection by several of the writers who are now part of the longest-running shared world in SF/F.<br /><br />I must advise you that it's likely that there will be limit on how many books you can get signed by George at his autographing session in Reno, as there will be on his official ADwD tour. But you can bring a friend or two to stand in line with you to spread the books out to more reasonable amounts per person. And if there's time, you can always go to the back of the line and come 'round again with more books to get signed. That's totally fair. It's when people turn up with two boxes of books and magazines that they want George to sign all in one go that make the autographing sessions seem endless while there's a hundred people waiting patiently to get just three or four books signed behind a 'collector' who may or may not be intending to keep George's signed books for themselves or intend to put them up on eBay as soon as they get through the autographing session. (Really, I've seen it happen - George signs something at an appearance and 2 hours later it's up on eBay. It's more like a scalper selling great seats for a major rock act at inflated prices than a GRRM fan who wants signed copies for themselves, or someone who wants to get a signed copy to give to a friend).<br /><br />Living in Reno will make it easier to deal with transporting your books you bring from home or buy at the convention. You don't have to worry about if you can fit them all in the luggage, coming and going!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 22 2011, 17:57:03 UTC","parent":13640702,"massactions":0,"subject":"George will be doing a autographing session at Reno","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"May 22 2011, 17:58:52 UTC","dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1306087023,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/217342.html?replyto=13645566","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/217342.html?thread=13645566#t13645566","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/217342.html?thread=13645566#t13645566","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/217342.html?thread=13645566#t13645566","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sir_zaibach","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sir-zaibach.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13645566,"talkid":53302,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/217342.html?thread=13645566#t13645566","upictitle":"sir_zaibach: pic#0","article":"Awesome.
