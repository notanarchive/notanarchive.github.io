{"itemid":1952,"subject":"Come Visit Westworld...","event":"... at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\n HBO's big new drama series WESTWORLD debuts on Sunday, October 2... but we'll be showing it a day early at the Jean Cocteau.   \r\n \r\n That's right.  We have a special Santa Fe PREMIERE scheduled for Saturday, October 1, with three showings of the first episode.  A morning showing in Spanish, an afternoon screening in English, both open to the general public on a first come, first seated basis, and a special invitation-only (sorry) VIP screening in the evening.\r\n\r\n All showings will be completely <span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\"><i><b>FREE. </b></i></span>\r\n\r\n WESTWORLD is based on the classic 1973 film of the same name, written and directed by Michael Crichton and starring Yul Brynner, Richard Benjamin, and James Brolin.   It's a science fiction thriller in Western clothes, about a futuristic theme park where patrons can live out their six-gun fantasies, gunning down robot outlaws and frolicking with robot dance hall girls... until something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n HBO's version has been completely reimagined and redeveloped by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, however (hey, it's not 1973 any more), and stars Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, and Evan Rachel Wood.   Everything I've heard about it sounds terrific; I can't wait to see it.   \r\n\r\n Here's a taste.\r\n\r\n <lj-embed id=\"833\"/>\r\n\r\n We're planning to have some gunslingers and dance hall girls of our own on site to help with the festivities.   Whether they will be robots ot not... well, you'll need to puzzle that one out on your own.

A friend of mine linked me a YouTube clip of the Bush-Clinton-Perot debate from 1992, in which three adults with differing political views engaged in a relatively civil argument over how best to manage the government, and suggested I view it after watching Trump 'debate' by interrupting constantly and call things 'terrible' and 'the worst ever.' It makes for a depressing comparison, especially when you realize many people think he <em>won</em> by doing this.<br /><br />For the first time in my life, I'm genuinely terrified by an election. Because even if Trump loses, the willful blindness, the lack of interest in substance, the approval of overt bullying tactics, the willingness to embrace a 'strong man' figure more befitting a banana republic than a first world democracy...all of the things his candidacy represents will still be there in the modern American electorate.<br /><br />God help us.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 months ago","ctime":"September 29 2016, 18:53:24
