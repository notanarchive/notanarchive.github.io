{"itemid":1693,"subject":"Home Alone","event":"Well, not really alone.  Parris is here, and my minions, and the Cocteau staff, and the cats... but I am not in San Diego at Comicon, and I have to admit, that feels strange.\r\n\r\nStaying home was the right decision.  I just got back from Chicago and the Dead shows, and before that it was Europe, and it is hardly as if HBO needed me in San Diego to represent... not with so much of our cast on hand.  I have so much work to do, I am way behind on everything, and I have a wedding to attend in Jersey in a few weeks, and worldcon after that... and if truth be told, San Diego has gotten overwhelming in recent years.  There are always good times catching up with friends, and hanging with the cast, but it's not as if I can walk the floor anymore and look for old comic books, the way I once did.\r\n\r\nEven so... even so... it does make me a little sad, not being there.\r\n\r\nAnyway, those of you who are there, be sure and catch THE EXPANSE premiere.  I wish I could.  Everything I've seen suggests that it will be a terrific show.  The books were certainly great.  Say hi to Daniel and Ty for me.\r\n\r\nYou might also visit the Random House booth to buy a calendar, and drop by the Tor/ Macmillan booth to buy a stack of books and show your support.","ditemid":433476,"eventtime":"2015-07-10 18:53:00","props":{"current_mood":"melancholy","current_location":"home","taglist":"conventions, comicon, game of thrones","current_moodid":39,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1437330017,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Home Alone http://goo.gl/N1nTYy","picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.692423985338537]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1436576054}","revtime":1437441398},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-11 00:53:27","anum":68,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html","event_timestamp":1436554380,"reply_count":83,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125207189/76434006","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html?thread=21975876#t21975876","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html?thread=21975876#t21975876","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html?thread=21975876#t21975876","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html?thread=21975876#t21975876","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3222516","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/sgadams0224","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21975876,"talkid":85843,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html?thread=21975876#t21975876","upictitle":"Shane Adams: pic#125207189","article":"That's bad mojo.
