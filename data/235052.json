{"itemid":918,"subject":"Worldcon Looms","event":"Tomorrow morning it's off to Reno for worldcon.\r\n\r\nWorldcon is my favorite con, and Reno promises to be an especially good one.  They have a very experienced committee and, by all reports, a great facility.  If the fannish ghods are good (and I sure hope they are), we will not be vexed by any of the hotel problems that troubled the recent worldcons in Melbourne and Montreal.  \r\n\r\nAll that being said... I sure wish Renovation was being held on Labor Day weekend.\r\n\r\nTwo reasons:\r\n       (1) Labor Day weekend is the perfect worldcon weekend, hallowed by decades of tradition (yes, I know the con originally started on July 4th weekend, but that was before I was born, and not relevant), and worldcon (and worldcon alone) belongs on that weekend,\r\n       (2) it would give me more time to rest.  It seems as though I just got back from San Diego Comicon and my nine-city book tour (maybe because I DID) and now I'm on the road again.  It's too damn soon.  San Diego has become an increasingly important part of the annual con circuit for any professional writer; worldcon needs more distance from it, to give us poor pros a chance to catch our breath, unpack our suitcases, maybe do a laundry.\r\n\r\nBut Renovation is when it is, and I'm not about to miss it.  \r\n\r\nSo off I go, weary or no.  See you there.\r\n\r\nThe road goes ever on and on...","ditemid":235052,"eventtime":"2011-08-14 20:46:00","props":{"taglist":"conventions","current_moodid":31,"commentalter":1314922711,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"torcon","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":5,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1314922796},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-08-15 02:46:08","anum":44,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/235052.html","event_timestamp":1313354760,"reply_count":50,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/94314405/7664017","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/235052.html?thread=14548780#t14548780","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/235052.html?thread=14548780#t14548780","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/235052.html?thread=14548780#t14548780","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mirrankei","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mirrankei.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14548780,"talkid":56831,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/235052.html?thread=14548780#t14548780","upictitle":"Mirrankei: Wolfpuppy","article":"<p>I'm looking forward to it too!
