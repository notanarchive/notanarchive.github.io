{"itemid":1687,"subject":"Buy Tor Now","event":"While I have been travelling, talking, touring, reading, writing, editing, and listening to great music these past few weeks, Puppygate has continued to fester, growing ever uglier.\r\n\r\nIn one of the more recent developments, the Rabid Puppies and some of their allies and fellow travellers have declared a boycott of Tor Books.  I say \"Rabid\" here because Beale is backing the boycott, while Larry Correia says the Sad Puppies are not boycotting anyone... though Correia and some of the other Sads certainly seem deeply sympathetic to the boycott.\r\n\r\nI am not, needless to say.  Neither is most of fandom.  \r\n\r\nWhich makes this a perfect time to BUY SOME TOR BOOKS!!\r\n\r\nYou can do that at your local bookstore, of course, or from your favorite online bookseller.  There is an incredible range of great SF and fantasy to choose from in the Tor catalogue.  Tor won the \"best publisher\" award in the recent LOCUS poll, for like the twentieth year in a row; there's really no other publisher in a field with a backlist to compare, whether you are looking for epic fantasy, space opera, military SF, literary SF, Hugo winners, Hugo losers, or what have you.\r\n\r\nAnd, hey, you can even buy some AUTOGRAPHED Tor books by me.  My Wild Cards series is published by Tor, as it happens, and we have signed copies of INSIDE STRAIGHT, BUSTED FLUSH, SUICIDE KINGS, FORT FREAK, and LOWBALL available through the Jean Cocteau... along with hardcovers of our award-winning anthology, DANGEROUS WOMEN, also published by Tor.  You can find them all at the cinema bookshop, here:  http://www.jeancocteaubooks.com/\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/256241/256241_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/256373/256373_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nSo if you would like to strike a blow for free speech and decency, and support all the good people at Tor, go ye forth and buy a book today... from the Cocteau, or Amazon, or anywhere... and let your voice be heard.  You'll get some damned good reading out of it too.","ditemid":431905,"eventtime":"2015-07-07 12:30:00","props":{"current_mood":"nostalgic","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"travels, life and death, music","current_moodid":60,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1436895582,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Buy Tor Now http://goo.gl/4e286G","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.683627374792737]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1436293846}","revtime":1436896021},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-07 18:30:26","anum":33,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431905.html","event_timestamp":1436272200,"reply_count":95,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125326985/75443278","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431905.html?thread=21910817#t21910817","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431905.html?thread=21910817#t21910817","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431905.html?thread=21910817#t21910817","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"storm59","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://storm59.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21910817,"talkid":85589,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431905.html?thread=21910817#t21910817","upictitle":"storm59: pic#125326985","article":"Slightly off topic but I love the Suicide Kings cover.

Since your original Hugo posts, I've followed both sides closely and visited all their sites and you are absolutely correct.<br /><br />The outrage against Tor is ridiculous. Two apologies have been given. Where are any of their apologies? Isn't Wright technically an employee of Tor as one of their paid authors? He constantly horribly rails against homosexuals, liberals, atheists all while screaming \"libel\" any time someone dares mention his name. Isn't he also guilty of insulting Tor's customers? Hypocrisy is all it is. They demand retribution in the name of some perceived slight against their honor, yet gleefully rail against anyone who is different. Men who aren't \"alphas\", non-Christians, feminists, liberals, homosexuals, you name it, with some of the most sickening insults ever and we are supposed to be surprised that someone like Gallo snapped and called them out. Unprofessional, sure, but no worse than anything said by them. Vox is calling George a rapist on a weekly basis. She apologized and, as many predicted, it wasn't enough. If she were to be fired, they would go for something else. <br /><br />Don't kid yourself - the rabids at least don't want more voices in the Hugos - they want only their own.<br /><br />I'm glad you were able to enjoy some time away.

The people leading the Sads and the Rabids insist that this is all to do with US politics; the fact that fans outside the U.S. don't give a toss about US politics really doesn't seem to register with them. <br /><br />I live in London, England; the site of Worldcon last year. It was the membership of Loncon which Brad falsely accused of fraudulently conspiring to award the novel Hugo to 'Ancilliary Justice' last year. That was an outright lie, and both fraud and conspiracy are criminal offences here in England. So, Brad, not content with accusing the membership of criminal offences, continues to reiterate that lie over and over. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Rabid in Chief, Theodore Beale, otherwise known as VD, has his own lies to tell, the most recent being that all English people dislike our Jewish communities. Of course, he has to lie because the reality is that we don't. A good recent example involves a small number of Neo-Nazis, who wanted to march through a London suburb where 40% of the community are Jewish, to attempt to intimidate those people in their own homes. This is a democratic country, and the police therefore provided a site for a static demonstration, in Whitehall which is the heart of government; they also provided a large police presence to defend that democratic right, because the anti-Nazi demonstrators vastly outnumbered the Neo-Nazis. <br /><br />There was a grand total of 20 Neo-Nazis, out of the population of England which is just under 54,000,000.  VD hasn't apologised for that lie either. On the one hand people scream about Tor's employee who apologised, whilst the man demanding that she be sacked asserts that the entire population of England dislike our Jewish fellow citizens; in other words that we are all Neo-Nazis.
