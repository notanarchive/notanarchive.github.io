{"itemid":797,"subject":"Win a Trip to Westeros!","event":"... or at least to Northern Ireland, which is about the closest we can come in the real world.\r\n\r\nSky Television has just announced a contest to help promote the April 18 debut of GAME OF THRONES in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe grand prize winners gets a week in Northern Ireland, with accomodation  at the Killyleagh Castle Towers as well as a trip to Castle Ward and Tollymore Forest Park, major locations while filming the show. \"Rumour has it that it contains magical woodland and mysterious medieval ruins!\" sayeth Sky.  (And maybe you can wheedle a visit to Castle Black as well, though that doesn't seem to be on the itinerary).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f71cy/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f71cy/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nFive runners up will win a tie in edition of Game of Thrones book and a set of all four titles in the Song of Fire and Ice series.\r\n\r\nTo sign up for the contest, go to:\r\n\r\nhttps://rewards.sky.com/skyloyalty/home/competitions/game-of-thrones-competition/?DCMP=snt-Games_of_Thrones_Sky_Twitter_Mar11\r\n\r\nI suspect the contest is only open to SKY subscribers resident in the UK or the Republic of Ireland, but I haven't looked closely at the rules, so maybe someone who has can confirm that.\r\n\r\nI have never stayed at Killyleagh Castle Towers myself, but Parris and I both loved Belfast.  Where they once built the TITANIC... and, as all the Belfast cabbies will tell you, a lot of ships that didn't sink.","ditemid":204234,"eventtime":"2011-03-25 12:31:00","props":{"taglist":"sky, television, game of thrones","current_moodid":44,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1358531626,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-03-25 18:35:45","anum":202,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html","event_timestamp":1301056260,"reply_count":24,"comments":[{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"wolfsilveroak","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wolfsilveroak.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12676298,"talkid":49516,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12676298#t12676298","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wolfsilveroak.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wolfsilveroak","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wolfsilveroak","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wolfsilveroak.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wolfsilveroak","ctime_ts":1301078548,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/52133768/4813537","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?replyto=12677578","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12677578#t12677578","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12677578#t12677578","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12677578#t12677578","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mopsie2002","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mopsie2002.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12677578,"talkid":49521,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12677578#t12677578","above":12676298,"upictitle":"Miranda: not enough time to read","article":"Yeah ditto...and even if you go to the \"verify your Sky iD\" (just in case), it only lists United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland as options.  *sigh*","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 25 2011, 19:14:55 UTC","parent":12676298,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mopsie2002.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mopsie2002","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mopsie2002","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mopsie2002.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mopsie2002","ctime_ts":1301080495,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?replyto=12676554","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12676554#t12676554","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12676554#t12676554","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12676554#t12676554","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rdmaughan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rdmaughan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12676554,"talkid":49517,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12676554#t12676554","upictitle":"rdmaughan: pic#0","article":"It is only open to Sky subscribers.

Have you ever considered putting yourself up for auction? Winner gets George RR Martin to hang out with for a couple hours. Kinda like what they did in Groundhog Day, and Full House, with Uncle Jessie. Proceeds could go to some charity, blah blah, whatever. Or you could just pocket the cash, which is what I'd do, because you'd have to put up with some eccentric, zealous fan like myself for two hours :)<br /><br />I'd so make a bid. I have some awesome antique chess sets, some insane Persian miniatures of middle eastern heroes bequeathed to me which were originally bought at market in Isfahan, Iran before the shaw was toppled. Plus I also have tons of Wild Cards stuff, most of which I'm sure you have and are probably tired of. I also recently bought some garage space in the artist warehouse district which I'll either convert into my own mead hall or a lifesize chessboard.<br /><br />A fan can only dream... sadly I have to pass on this contest because I don't have Sky and I don't live in Europe.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 26 2011, 01:13:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ruylopezdefns","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ruylopezdefns","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_353241","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=32753956&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ruylopezdefns","ctime_ts":1301102002,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109232262/36318516","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?replyto=12683466","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12683466#t12683466","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12683466#t12683466","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12683466#t12683466","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_469393","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/heath.beaver","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12683466,"talkid":49544,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204234.html?thread=12683466#t12683466","upictitle":"Heath Beaver: pic#109232262","article":"Ooooh.
