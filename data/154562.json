The tension comes as the crew's patience is tested by the captain's postponement of the next shark-hunting expedition. Needless to say, the crew is upset, but they linger on knowing that the biggest fish of them all is, eventually, their next target...but I won't give away the climax! :)<br /><br />Anyway, despite a nice premise, the book never really took off (although my second ex-wife enjoyed it), and I was sitting in a lot of empty book signings just like Mr. Hall!

I was late arriving, since the con had moved my slot to an earlier session, and not told me.  Next to me were two well-known writers (names withheld).  There was a line stretching from my end of the table down the aisle.  I told the first person in line not to stand on ceremony, and to please go on ahead to the person they wanted to meet.  \"That would be you\", I was told.  Turned out the entire line was waiting for me.  They were all people who knew me from sff.net, and they'd grouped together to give me a warm welcome at my first signing.  I signed dozens of books, posed for pictures, received hugs and gifts.  The other two writers were surprised, at best.  I out-drew both of them by a good margin.<br /><br />My next, and last, signing was at a local con six months later, where I sat for an hour, signed nothing, and no one even stopped to chat with me.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"May 24 2010, 15:49:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://delkytlar.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"delkytlar","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"delkytlar","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://delkytlar.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"delkytlar","ctime_ts":1274716197,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/26751261/697558","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/154562.html?replyto=10135234","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/154562.html?thread=10135234#t10135234","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/154562.html?thread=10135234#t10135234","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/154562.html?thread=10135234#t10135234","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/154562.html?thread=10135234#t10135234","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"scott_lynch","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://scott-lynch.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10135234,"talkid":39590,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/154562.html?thread=10135234#t10135234","upictitle":"Scott: Cocky Jedi","article":"Heh.
