Smith: pic#107568285","article":"though I do have a couple of criticisms, mainly focused on the way it might have done better in bringing new viewers along to the LARGE cast of characters and plot threads:<br /><br />1) The opening sequence.  It's really fun to watch, but I think a more effective sequence would have been one that highlighted the most important season characters and their groups(<br />King - Robert<br />Lannisters - Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion, Joffrey<br />Stark - Ned, Catelyn, Jon, Robb, Sansa, Arya<br />Other Kings Landing - Littlefinger, Varys<br />Across the sea: Dany, Viserys, Khal Drogo<br />).<br /><br />2) The focus on Aerys.  While it's interesting to get backstory on him, it's ultimately not an extremely important season 1 plot thread.  It might have been more effective for Ned to build in something to the effect of \"He was evil, Jaime betrayed and murdered him, and Jaime is a bad/untrustworthy person because of it\" during his conversation with Arya.<br /><br />While the conversation between Ned and Jaime felt dramatic, it also muddied the waters and put focus on a plot thread (including the details of the bad things Aerys did) that really isn't central to the season 1 plot.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"May 6 2011, 21:16:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I&#39;ve enjoyed the series quite a bit","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/mhsmith0","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Matthew Smith","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_394220","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=33674296&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Matthew Smith","ctime_ts":1304716560,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213536.html?replyto=13387040","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213536.html?thread=13387040#t13387040","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213536.html?thread=13387040#t13387040","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213536.html?thread=13387040#t13387040","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213536.html?thread=13387040#t13387040","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"writer_jena","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://writer-jena.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13387040,"talkid":52293,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213536.html?thread=13387040#t13387040","above":13381152,"upictitle":"writer_jena: pic#0","article":"I disagree. See, while they're spending a while focusing on it now, I feel that it serves as a reminder to the audience of the connection between Dany across the sea and the world here. Also, a lot of the comments mentioned towards mad king -are- in the book - but they're in subtext. They're in the comments made in the character's heads, not out loud, which does bull hucky for a visual medium. While there's a lot of focus on it at the moment, I definitely sense the focus shifting now that they've cleared that up. After all, dialogue is pretty much the only way that this new audience will understand the rich back story and subplots and subtext involved in Martin's novels - in which case, new dialogue and new scenes focusing on the unseen is important. <br /><br />But of course, this is just my opinion, and I could be wrong, but as a writer myself, I like to think of the difference being like this: In novels, if you craft it write, you can tell the whole story without your characters saying much at all. Whereas in the visual media, especially with all the plots involved in Game of thrones, dialogue  is essential. Though your take on it is interesting, and one worth noting.
