{"itemid":658,"subject":"You Guys Are Scary Good","event":"muttermuttermuttermutter\r\n\r\nI cannot BELIEVE how fast you guys unravel even my most obscure and difficult clues.  The CIA should be looking to hire you all to break cyphers.\r\n\r\n(I'm going to \"Adult Content\" this post, which I've never done before, because... well it will be pretty self-explanatory).\r\n\r\nAnyway, yes, you nailed the first one in three blinks and a winks.  The role of Dany's handmaiden Doreah will be played by ROXANNE MCKEE.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000c2wed/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000c2wed/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"221\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nDoreah was one of three slave girls given to Dany as a wedding present by her brother Viserys (big brother's gift), though of course Viserys got the girls from Magister Illyrio Mopatis, which is why I misremembered them as the fat man's gift.  Irri and Jhiqui are Dothraki, but Doreah came from the pillow houses of Lys.  \r\n\r\nRoxanne McKee was born in Canada (the great white north), but moved to England, where she appeared in the soap opera HOLLYOAKS (the land of oaks and hollies).  She has thrice been nominated for \"Sexiest Female\" in the British Soap Awards, winning twice (she was the sexiest female twice, NOT the sexiest female once).  Her most recent role was in a film called F .  She has also appeared on LILY ALLEN & FRIENDS, and Lily of course is the sister of our Theon, Alfie Allen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000c354y/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000c354y/s320x240\" width=\"205\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nDoreah is given to Dany to instruct her in the erotic arts.  Viserys himself vouches for her skills.  We had a lot of beautiful young women reading for the role, so this one was a tough call.  Congratulations to Roxanne on winning the part,","ditemid":168457,"eventtime":"2010-07-28 19:10:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":116,"commentalter":1280520887,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":263,"picture_keyword":"hiya hiya hiya","opt_screening":"F","adult_content":"explicit","personifi_tags":"2:5,28:8,18:8,33:2,10:5,42:5,3:26,25:23,26:14,20:2,9:29,21:11,nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1280614433},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-07-29 01:10:11","anum":9,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html","event_timestamp":1280344200,"reply_count":10,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98198739/7319215","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10765065#t10765065","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10765065#t10765065","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10765065#t10765065","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"stegoking","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://stegoking.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10765065,"talkid":42051,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10765065#t10765065","upictitle":"William: He-Man Legs","article":"I'll bet she has an amazing personality.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 29 2010, 01:18:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://stegoking.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"stegoking","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"stegoking","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://stegoking.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"stegoking","ctime_ts":1280366302,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/1290105/169732","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10766857#t10766857","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10766857#t10766857","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10766857#t10766857","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"arya","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://arya.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10766857,"talkid":42058,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10766857#t10766857","above":10765065,"upictitle":"Mikaeri Bijin: domo-kun wtf?","article":"^^ Stego, you just made me guffaw out loud so hard it hurt my healing throat (recent tonsillectomy!).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","below":10767625,"ctime":"July 29 2010, 01:38:51 UTC","parent":10765065,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://arya.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"arya","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"arya","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://arya.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"arya","ctime_ts":1280367531,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10767625#t10767625","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10767625#t10767625","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10767625#t10767625","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"scottgoblue314","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://scottgoblue314.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10767625,"talkid":42061,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/168457.html?thread=10767625#t10767625","above":10766857,"upictitle":"scottgoblue314: pic#0","article":"Yeah, she has great personalities.
