{"itemid":1009,"subject":"Life is STILL Magical...","event":"... this week, at least.  \r\n\r\nA great weekend of playoff football.  The Saturday games... well, there was certainly a lot of scoring.  A little frustrating for those old school guys like me who like a bit of defense from time to time, but I can't deny it was exciting.  The Saints look especially scary.  They killed the G-Men when we went down and played them in Nawlins during the season, and I have a feeling they will kill anyone who has to play them in the Superdome.  But the rest of their games are likely to be on the road, so you never know.\r\n\r\nGood win for the Texans too.  I have no particular rooting interest in either Houston or Cincinnati, so I didn't much care how that game came out... but it occurs to me that somewhere in Dallas, Jerry Jones is probably making the pissy face at the thought of another Texas team being in the playoffs while his Cowboys are home.  So that's good.\r\n\r\nThe Steeler/ Bronco game was pretty wild.  Really thought that Denver had blown it there, but that overtime was a dagger in the heart.  Tebow... what can I possibly say about Tebow that half a million talking heads on ESPN haven't said already?  Three hundred yards passing on ten completions... it beggars understanding... but there you are.  Somehow I suspect that Evil Little Bill had a role in this... I'm sure he'd much rather face Tebow than the Steelers D, as wounded as Pittsburgh was.\r\n\r\nOf course, my favorite game was the big Giants win over Atlanta.  They are weeping in the Vale, but rejoicing on the Wall.  And hey, those were the REAL Giants, the ones who have been missing all season.  Great swarming D and a smashmouth two-headed running game, that's what I've been waiting for.  A shaky beginning, right up to the Atlanta safety, but after that it was complete NYG domination.  Another great game by Eli.  The Falcons clamped down on my man Victor Cruz pretty hard, but that was okay, Hakeem Nicks and Mario Manningham stepped up to take his place.  Had to love that last play of the game too, when Osi sacked not only Matt Ryan but also the Atlanta left tackle, driving him back into his QB and tackling both of them.\r\n\r\nWhich means another trip to the Frozen Tundra next week.  Shades of 2007.  I hope it's forty below zero again, just like it was back then.  Should be epic.\r\n\r\n((Far be from me to complain, but the officiating sucked all weekend.  The Broncos got robbed on that lateral.  The Giants were the victim of at least three terrible calls.  And the Lions were also screwed by the zebras.  I suspect the results of all three games would have been the same in either case, but really, the refs should watch those premature whistles)).","ditemid":258323,"eventtime":"2012-01-08 22:48:00","props":{"current_location":"santa fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1326629922,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1327083882},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-01-09 05:52:52","anum":19,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html","event_timestamp":1326062880,"reply_count":47,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117100358/42758868","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15228947#t15228947","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15228947#t15228947","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15228947#t15228947","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"torome86","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://torome86.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15228947,"talkid":59488,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15228947#t15228947","article":"It was aobut time the zebras had their revenge upon the lions for all the kin they lost...","upictitle":"torome86: pic#117100358","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"5 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"January 9 2012, 05:58:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Lions screwed by Zebras","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://torome86.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"torome86","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"torome86","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://torome86.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"torome86","ctime_ts":1326088725,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121313083/9947615","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15229203#t15229203","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15229203#t15229203","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15229203#t15229203","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"douglascohen","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://douglascohen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15229203,"talkid":59489,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15229203#t15229203","upictitle":"Douglas Cohen: pic#121313083","article":"The refs should be ashamed of themselves, but at least all the teams that deserved to win did.

Thankfully we have guy with his fair share of magic and a bit more.<br /><br />The Giants played a hell of game. Mostly defensively. I can't remember the Giants playing that dominantly even against bad teams since the days of LT. <br /><br />Like I always say, Gilbride, Fewell and Coughlin are great! Seriously, Gilbride called a good game. Fewell simplified his system and has a fuller complement of players. It looks like everyone is pulling for Tom.<br /><br />Next week's games should be very interesting. Tebow vs Brady. The Saints outdoors. Those other two teams and the Giants at the Packers.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I want the weather to be like it was in 2007. The cold beat down an old Brett Favre. The Giants are considerably healthier than they were the first time the two teams met this season, but they are still the walking wounded. Severely cold weather may exacerbate those issues. But, who knows? It may also help them focus and play with intensity and a sense of destiny.<br /><br />I think that barring critical injuries and bad calls the Giants will win. On defense, having a healthier Osi (that was an LT-escue sack) and Tuck along with JPP means that Canty, Joseph and Bernard can get penetration. The Giants are still weak at LB but with the addition of Blackburn and the return of Boley have made them better. \"At the end of the day\" as Rolle mentioned and Tuck repeated yesterday, the defense is playing as a unit. They are trusting the guy next to them to do their jobs and not trying to cheat or overplay.<br /><br />Hopefully the horrible calls that gave GB a TD and took one away from the Giants the last time will even out this time around. And I also hope that the officials will make at least one call when a defender mugs Nicks. The Giants can beat these guys by ten points. At the end of the day.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"January 9 2012, 17:05:30 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1326128730,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/9963724/439663","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15233811#t15233811","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15233811#t15233811","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15233811#t15233811","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"yagathai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15233811,"talkid":59507,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/258323.html?thread=15233811#t15233811","upictitle":"Names Is For Tombstones, Baby: Rocketeer","article":"300 yards on 10 passes, sure, but he attempted 21 passes.

As an avid british viewer of america's game , can I just say how strange i find it that anyone that supports a team can also root for their nearest rivals, as in the jets/giants scenario. In england it is virtually unheard of to support two teams , and far more common for their nearest rivals to be the object of loathing ,derision and in most cases a kind of tribal hatred, as exists between the two main london teams , my beloved mighty spurs, and the greyscale-ridden scum from flea bottom, arsenal. I understand the two conference system dictates the two rarely meet,so maybe the rivalry is not fueled by important victories or devastating loses.Other than that , I am at a loss.Could anyone explain it to me please?
