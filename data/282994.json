{"itemid":1105,"subject":"Weeklong Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary Charity Drive","event":"ENDING SOON!!!\r\n\r\nOur supply of DANCE WITH DRAGONS is sold out, but there are still copies of the CAPTAIN OF GUARDS chapbook available for a $10 donation to the wolves.\r\n\r\n==================================================================\r\n\r\nI've always been fond of wolves... direwolves in Westeros, and real wolves in the real world.  \r\n\r\nWolves have faced a tough road for the last century or so.  US wolf populations hit critical lows during the twentieth century, and finding a way for humans to co-exist with this majestic creatures is an important part of the conservation movement.  Here in my home state of New Mexico, we have the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary (http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/index.php) doing important work in protecting the animals and in educating their two legged neighbors on how to get along.  It's work I strongly support, with both my words and my checkbook.\r\n\r\nI invite you to join me over the next week.  In conjunction with Wild Spirit, I'm sponsoring a charity drive to raise funds for the shelter.  For the next week, we'll be offering a pair of items from my personal library to people making donations.  You can find the books being offered and the donation amounts here: http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/georgemartin_bookfund.php\r\n\r\nFor a donation of $100 to the Wild Spirit Sanctuary, I will send you a first edition hardcover of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, autographed... autographed and personally inscribed (upon request).  For the most part I have been forced to stop doing personal inscriptions at my bookstore signings, con appearances, and the like... the crowds have simply gotten too large... so this is a rare chance for those who'd like to have a book personalizations.  But the offer is limited to forty (40) copies, first come, first served.  So if you want one, click on the link and make that donation NOW.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/images/DWD_Book.jpg\" alt=\"Dance with Dragons\" />\r\n\r\nFor those who can't afford a hundred bucks, or arrive at the party too late after the forty copies are gone, we have another offering -- a special promotional chapbook featuring the \"Captain of the Guards\" chapter from A FEAST FOR CROWS.  This was prepared by Bantam as a promotional item for the BEA (Book Expo America) and was given away to attendees at that event, but copies were never sold in any bookstore, so it's a pretty cool collectible for the fans who have everything, and a $10 donation to the sanctuary will snag you a copy.  I will be glad to sign these items as well -- but, alas, only a straight signature, no personalization or inscription.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/images/FFC_Chap.jpg\" alt=\"Captain of the Guards\" />\r\n\r\nSo $10 will get you a signed CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and $100 will get you a signed and inscribed DANCE WITH DRAGONS.  But don't do it for the books.  Do it because the world would be a much worse place without this face in it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/images/animals/ally/Ally_Profile.jpg\" alt=\"Ally the happy wolf\" />\r\n\r\nTHIS DRIVE WILL END ON SATURDAY AT MIDNIGHT.  So if you would like to make a donation and give some wolves a hand, act now.  Do it for House Stark.  If we raise enough money, maybe I'll let some Starks live a little longer...","ditemid":282994,"eventtime":"2012-06-29 22:55:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"charity, dance with dragons, signed books","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1341810157,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":5,"interface":"web","revtime":1341990189},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-06-25 04:55:49","anum":114,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html","event_timestamp":1341010500,"reply_count":46,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/108256824/34780068","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16148082#t16148082","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16148082#t16148082","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16148082#t16148082","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"anne3624","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://anne3624.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16148082,"talkid":63078,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16148082#t16148082","upictitle":"anne3624: pic#108256824","article":"For House Stark!

It is a very rare person who has the training, the ability, even the type of property to live on with a wolf-hybrid. There are restrictions in many counties that ban or heavily restrict the ownership of wolf-hybrids. Even people who are successful living and caring for their animals, outside circumstances, such as the loss of a job and property where they live with their animal, a divorce or serious illness can mean that they can no longer care for their wolf-hybrids. WSWS has taken in some of the animals that otherwise be abandoned, or even put to death.<br /><br />WSWS also has a small pack of the rare and endangered New Guinea SInging Dogs, rescued from an animal hoarder. Sadly, they cannot be used to protect the breed because they had been inter-bred by the hoarder. But they are wonderful creatures, and are thriving at WSWS. Go look at the pictures and read about them at the WSWS web site!<br /><br />People even drop off dogs that need a new home, and WSWS cares for them and finds them new homes. Like many rural counties, there aren't a lot of options for lost, abandoned animals.<br /><br />There are other wolf/wolf-hybrid sanctuaries in the US, there might be one near you. Even a small donation of cash, or a gift card for the sanctuary is meaningful to the organization, so if you can, please do make a donation or offer to help in whatever way you can.<br /><br />I became a 'wolf-mother' many years ago when the Brotherhood Without Banners gave me a sponsorship of a wolf-hybrid named Sasquatch as a Yule present. Sasquatch passed over the Rainbow Bridge a long time ago, but I remained a supporter of WSWS. WSWS offers books about wolves, and the personal memoirs of people who worked and lived with wolves/hybrids. They have many wonderful gifts that support their work, so if you have a friend or loved one who likes wolves, please think of giving them a gift from WSWS for their next birthday or mid-Winter holiday present.<br /><br />thanks to all, and one big happy howl of joy!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"June 26 2012, 14:27:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"thanks to everyone who is donating to WSWS","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1340720859,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117829068/50694019","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16174706#t16174706","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16174706#t16174706","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16174706#t16174706","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16174706#t16174706","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1276189","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/george.stapleton.96","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16174706,"talkid":63182,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282994.html?thread=16174706#t16174706","above":16167282,"upictitle":"George Stapleton: pic#117829068","article":"Parris;<br /><br />Thank you so much for your recognition of the work we do!!

The amazing turnout of George's fans for our cause is so heart warming, I am carried away on a tide of emotion just thinking about it. I went and sat with ALL of our Wolves, Wolfdogs, & Singers today and told them what was happening in our Human world, and you know what? I believe that they understood me, all of them, each and every one did something to make me feel that they understood. I do not spend much time with people, and when you spend time with the Animals here like that, you develop a sense of \"picture\" communication with them.
