{"itemid":1251,"subject":"Email Woes","event":"My e-mail is down again.  Happened last week for most a day, then somehow fixed itself.  Now it's happening again, and does not seem inclined to get better.\r\n\r\nI get my email through Mozilla Thunderbird.  When I log onto Thunderbird, I can see that I have lots and lots of new mails, but whenever I try to open one... or scroll down, or do anything else... Thunderbird freezes and goes non-responsive.  It has happened over and over again.  Nor will the damn thing unfreeze unless I turn off the computer and reboot.  A real pain.  I've rebooted a dozen times, run half a different virus checks, and nothing.  Tried booting up Thunderbird in safe mode, no help.  \r\n\r\nAnd of course this happens when Ty if off.  Ty is my in-house computer guru.  The computer always breaks down when he's away, never when he's here.  And he won't be here again till Monday.\r\n\r\nSo if you've sent me an email, don't hold your breath waiting for an answer.  You won't get one.  Not till Monday, best guess.  Unless a miracle occurs.\r\n\r\nI hate this damn machine.  And Windows.  And Thunderbird.\r\n\r\nIf only I could send email with DOS.  DOS never fails me.\r\n\r\nFIXED.  For now, at least.  Thanks to Stephen, the Gandalf of Computer Wizards, from Oz.","ditemid":320343,"eventtime":"2013-04-17 18:06:00","props":{"taglist":"everyday life, computer woes","current_moodid":47,"commentalter":1366250468,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"angry","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1366250333},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-04-18 00:05:56","anum":87,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html","event_timestamp":1366221960,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/87739461/8066895","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17575767#t17575767","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17575767#t17575767","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17575767#t17575767","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kuri_chan_17","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kuri-chan-17.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17575767,"talkid":68655,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17575767#t17575767","upictitle":"Ghoulia Child: pic#87739461","article":"I sent Parris an email earlier this week regarding an upcoming con you're both attending in May.

I have an IT background and although I cannot fix your problem from across the ether can perhaps offer some commentary which might be relevant.<br /><br />I am guessing you have an enormous volume of email? Perhaps thousands, or even 10s of thousands? In my experience very few email clients can reliably handle this and frequent crashes, corrupt data or at best slow performance is the order of the day. Check with Ty, but once your email database is getting close to a gigabyte I would not expect reliable operation from Windows Mail, Thunderbird or any similar consumer level email client. Microsoft Outlook is *better* but can still be problematic when your mail file is over 2 gig.<br /><br />If your mail storage is large and is the cause of the problem there are a few options:<br /><br />-online email client. These will operate to pretty much any size, are often free and give you the advantage of looking at exactly the same mailbox no matter what computer you check the email from. Downside, you have to trust Google or Microsoft (these are only two services I would bother with) not to spy/release details etc Realistically though, all email is already intercepted and recorded by various govt. agencies anyway<br />-change your email client to something more robust. Realistically this means Microsoft Outlook<br />-Ty might be able to perform some voodoo magic and archive/split up your email. This will make searching old emails more difficult, and the process will have to be done on a regular basis but should make Thunderbird more responsive and not crash<br /><br />My advice (me being a total stranger whom you should implicitly trust of course) is to migrate to cloud email storage. Your existing email can be forwarded to a new address seamlessly and you wont lose anything if your computer melts into slag one day. Both the Microsoft and gmail services also offer two-factor authentication which means internet trolls cant get your email even if they correctly guess your password. No doubt Ty can explain in more detail if this option interests you.<br /><br />A good second choice is MS Outlook but whatever you do I strongly suggest moving away from Thunderbird. I used to install it for clients nearly 10 years ago as it was a bit safer than Outlook Express at the time (virus email attachments were the rage back then) but it is just as prone to corrupting the mail store for large mailboxes (large being more then 1 gig).<br /><br />Good luck with whatever you do, but remember this is 2013 and there is no excuse for a computer (windows or otherwise) to not handle whatever amount of email you throw at it, and to do it fast and reliably. If you are having repeated troubles then there is either something physically wrong with your computer or the way it has been setup.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />EDIT: Rereading your post about running different virus scans, hopefully you don't have multiple virus scanners installed. That is the quickest way to make any computer slow and painful to use. Anti-virus programs are also mostly reduntant these days, but that is another long winded post - short option: IMO just install MS Security Essentials and use chrome or firefox as your web browser. Done.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 18 2013, 00:45:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The curse of email","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/mrblenny","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mrblenny","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1761464","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=63035230&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"April 18 2013, 00:53:55 UTC","dname":"mrblenny","ctime_ts":1366245937,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/101252367/578090","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17577303#t17577303","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17577303#t17577303","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17577303#t17577303","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bungeebot","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17577303,"talkid":68661,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320343.html?thread=17577303#t17577303","upictitle":"Zack: knytt stories bird","article":"Really sorry to hear about this.

I wouldn't begin to presume what your email is like, but I thought I'd pass it along at least in case that was the problem.
