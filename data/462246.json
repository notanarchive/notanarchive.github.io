I know Orys Baratheon \"took the heraldry of the Storm Kings\", and House Durrandon's heraldry was a crowned stag because they were kings.<br /><br />I assumed that the Baratheons *removed* the crown from the stag, however, given that they were *not* kings, and that the crown was only added back after Robert's Rebellion.  However, Elio said this was just a fan assumption, so now I'm not sure.  Officially, was the Baratheon sigil always a crowned stag, even since Orys's day?<br /><br />I ask because I previously wrote a rather long note on the Heraldry article over on Game of Thrones Wiki declaring \"any potential live-action flashback to the Dunk & Egg era shouldn't use a crowned stag\" - and, by gumbo, I may have screwed the pooch on this one.  If you give an official statement we can cite it in the Westeros.org wiki.<br /><br />In Season 1 of the TV show, when Maester Luwin is quizzing Bran Stark on heraldry, Bran distinctly says \"it's a crowned stag *now that Robert is king*\" - which was one of the sources of my confusion.  Should this be considered a dialogue error?<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, the numerical values of prices seem to be consistently about three times higher in the Dunk & Egg era, i.e. a knight's horse is worth 750 silver stags = about 3 and a half gold dragons or so, but in the main novels Jaime says that ONE gold dragon is a good price for a horse.  Was this intentionally thought out, to illustrate inflation and such?  The theory is that similar to the real life Black Death, the die-off in winter right before the Hedge Knight made the price of labor go up, but goods more expensive, resulting in deflation (in contrast, the main novels take place at the *end* of a long summer, with both labor and goods cheap).  <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 28 2015, 16:24:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Dunk and Egg era Baratheon sigil?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ADragonDemands","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2902334","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73354478&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ADragonDemands","ctime_ts":1451319858,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/462246.html?thread=23352230#t23352230","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/462246.html?thread=23352230#t23352230","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/462246.html?thread=23352230#t23352230","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23352230,"talkid":91219,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/462246.html?thread=23352230#t23352230","above":23348390,"upictitle":"George R.R.
