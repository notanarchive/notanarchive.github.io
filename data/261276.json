{"itemid":1020,"subject":"Super G-Men!!!!","event":"Life is magical and full of joy!\r\n\r\nTHE GIANTS ARE GOING TO THE SUPERBOWL!!\r\n\r\nWhat a game.  What a bloody great game.  THIS is what football is supposed to be like.  Real smashmouth kickass old-fashioned duel to the death.  DAMN but that 49ers defense played great.  I don't think I have ever seen Eli take such a hammering, but he kept getting up and fighting on.  And my man Cruz was magnificant as well... though the Niners obviously made adjustments at the half to clamp down on him, or else the win would have been much more lopsided.\r\n\r\nThe Giants D played great as well.  They did not get nearly as many sacks on Alex Smith as I had expected/ hoped for, but they kept him under constant pressure, held Gore in check for the most part, and stifled the 49er receivers... well, except for those two times when Vernon Davis got loose.  \r\n\r\nBut it was turnovers that won the game.  Turnovers, and Big Blue's special teams.  I never could have called that.  Our special teams have been a weakness all years.  Weatherford's a decent punter but not a great one.  Ditto the Scottish Kicker (bad luck to say his name).  And we get NOTHING on kickoff returns or punt returns.  But it was the coverage teams, and the turnovers we got on those two punts, that made the difference in the end... and once again the Scottish Kicker came through!  (My heart did stutter a little when we got that stupid delay-of-game penalty just before the FG attempt, adding five yards to the distance).\r\n\r\nWho would ever have thought it?  Not me, I admit.  Not after that four game losing streak in mid-season and that dreadful December defeat by the Redskins.  But then something funny happened.  The Real Giants showed up.  \r\n\r\nSo now we're off to Indy, and a rematch of SuperBowl XLII with the Patriots and Evil Little Bill.  Why, it's like an epic fantasy... the heroes from NYC against the Dark Lord and his minions.  \r\n\r\nBut that's two weeks away.  Right now, I'll just enjoy the win.  And hats off to the 49ers too.  They had a great season, and Jim Harbaugh deserves all the credit in the world for turning that team around.  I think they will be contenders for years to come.","ditemid":261276,"eventtime":"2012-01-22 21:31:00","props":{"current_location":"flying high","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":98,"commentalter":1328030464,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1328031754},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-01-23 04:30:58","anum":156,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html","event_timestamp":1327267860,"reply_count":56,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115574360/45684485","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15294108#t15294108","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15294108#t15294108","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15294108#t15294108","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15294108#t15294108","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1000909","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://my.mail.ru/mail/abarrett/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15294108,"talkid":59742,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15294108#t15294108","upictitle":"Arthur Barrett: pic#115574360","article":"I love your books, Mr Martin, but I sincerely hope my Patriots give your Giants a good thrashing.

Mostly everyone here in Louisiana loves the Mannings and roots for their teams when the Saints are out. We let Archie down, I think, and it's great watching Eli play to his potential as we've seen Peyton do in the past and hopefully the future. (unless they're playing the Saints!)<br /><br />To see the Giants in the Superbowl again is great, and I'll be wholeheartedly rooting for them. I admit a grudging respect for BB and Brady, who've dominated so much this past decade, but I believe in the uplifting spirit of the underdog before I believe in the resentful spirit of revenge.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"January 23 2012, 08:02:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dreamsofdawn.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dreamsofdawn","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dreamsofdawn","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dreamsofdawn.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dreamsofdawn","ctime_ts":1327305756,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/7392609/1313758","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298460#t15298460","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298460#t15298460","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298460#t15298460","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"virtual_munkee","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://virtual-munkee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15298460,"talkid":59759,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298460#t15298460","upictitle":"Da Wild One: portrait","article":"cool you are a 49ers fan! watching from australia, great to hear we are through!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"January 23 2012, 08:24:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://virtual-munkee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"virtual_munkee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"virtual_munkee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://virtual-munkee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"virtual_munkee","ctime_ts":1327307083,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115576930/45688229","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298716#t15298716","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298716#t15298716","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298716#t15298716","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1001180","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=500879392","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15298716,"talkid":59760,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/261276.html?thread=15298716#t15298716","upictitle":"Jay Anderson: pic#115576930","article":"Wow, what a game.
