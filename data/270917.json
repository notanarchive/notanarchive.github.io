{"itemid":1058,"subject":"March Madness","event":"Somehow it has become March already.  Where did January and February go?\r\n\r\nTwo months of the year are gone, and already I feel as if I'm two months behind.\r\n\r\nAnd things only get crazier from here.  \r\n\r\nCANADIANS, take note!  I am heading up to Toronto in less than two weeks.  I'll be speaking and reading at the Toronto International Film Festival (sorry, they tell me the event is already sold out), and the signing at Indigo Books.  Dates, times, and other details available on my website, so go check there for links.  \r\n\r\nBack home after that, and back at work, but then at month's end I am off again, this time to the UK, where I will be Guest of Honor at Eastercon, this year at Heathrow.  I will also be doing a couple of signings, one in Bath and one in London.  From the UK, I head to Portugal, and events in Lisbon and Porto.  Back home again just in time for the NFL Draft (didn't think I'd miss THAT, didja?).\r\n\r\nIn between all this, I have, hmmmmm, lemme see, one two three four FIVE projects that I am currently working on, four of which were due months ago... but it's the fifth that has all my attention now, that I absolutely must finish and deliver before the trip to the UK.\r\n\r\n(Oh, and somewhere in there me and my assistants and my accountant must find time to prepare my taxes, so I can write the IRS the biggest check that I have written in my life.  I am going to be much, much poorer by month's end)\r\n\r\nBusy, busy, busy.\r\n\r\nI love the work, actually.  I just hate the deadlines.","ditemid":270917,"eventtime":"2012-03-01 12:17:00","props":{"current_location":"home... for now","taglist":"travels, writing, conventions","current_moodid":106,"commentalter":1330887977,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"writing","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1331830714},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-03-01 19:20:20","anum":69,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270917.html","event_timestamp":1330604220,"reply_count":20,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116131088/45519721","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270917.html?thread=15573061#t15573061","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270917.html?thread=15573061#t15573061","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270917.html?thread=15573061#t15573061","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"superscienceser","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://superscienceser.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15573061,"talkid":60832,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270917.html?thread=15573061#t15573061","article":"Quebec, oh, I wish you were coming there, I'd be so excited.

What bothers me is simply the fact that you’ve heard this so many times that the words almost lose meaning. However, I still want to say that reading your books have given me one of the most satisfactory experiences of a lifetime. Your books allow me to immerse myself in the imaginary world of Westeros and actually feel like I’m living with those characters. Being a Cinema student I comprehend the process of  “escapism” and with your books I find myself a “victim” of such – I must say you have accomplished the ability to “juggle” our emotions when devouring the adventures of our most beloved characters. For that I deeply thank you.<br /><br />I’m also sorry for not finding the proper words to express myself towards your Work as I much desired.<br /> <br />My reasons for writing this comment rely on your trip to Portugal. I’ve been anxiously waiting to find out the exact whereabouts of your tour in Lisbon. I doubt you’ll know where your “conference” will take place but in case you do I would appreciate if you could share that information.<br /> <br />I sincerely wish all the best and once again thank you for your marvelous and astonishing writing.
