Check out the full list of nominees here:\r\n\r\nhttp://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/06/critics-choice-television-awards/\r\n\r\nIt's an impressive list of nominees.  Congratulations to David and Dan and the cast and crew and support staff at HBO, all the great folks who worked so hard to make the show the success it seems to be.  Great work, guys!\r\n\r\n((And yes, I do wish some of our cast had gotten nominated as well.  We have some amazing actors on GAME OF THRONES.  Traditionally, though, fantasy and SF have always been overlooked in the acting categories.  But maybe we'll do better in the Emmys and Golden Globes))\r\n\r\nOn other fronts... Sunday's episode, \"The Pointy End,\" got the highest ratings of the season.  The show is building.   I suspect that this record will endure until... well, Sunday.","ditemid":220156,"eventtime":"2011-06-07 19:57:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1307748586,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1307807928},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-06-08 01:57:13","anum":252,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html","event_timestamp":1307476620,"reply_count":41,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/107465690/21641987","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778428#t13778428","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778428#t13778428","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778428#t13778428","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trfhms","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trfhms.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13778428,"talkid":53821,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778428#t13778428","upictitle":"trfhms: mii","article":"love it!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 8 2011, 02:08:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"WOO HOO!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://trfhms.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"trfhms","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"trfhms","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://trfhms.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"trfhms","ctime_ts":1307498912,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98567651/25231307","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778684#t13778684","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778684#t13778684","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778684#t13778684","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"prof_nrvna","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://prof-nrvna.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13778684,"talkid":53822,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778684#t13778684","upictitle":"prof_nrvna: pic#98567651","article":"Sunday, bloody Sunday.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 8 2011, 02:13:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://prof-nrvna.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"prof_nrvna","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"prof_nrvna","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://prof-nrvna.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"prof_nrvna","ctime_ts":1307499188,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103219428/632460","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778940#t13778940","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778940#t13778940","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778940#t13778940","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"musedmoose","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://musedmoose.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13778940,"talkid":53823,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13778940#t13778940","upictitle":"Moose: mooseava","article":"Congratulations on that, Mr. Martin; the show deserves every honor it receives.  ^_^  I was discussing the 8th episode with a co-worker who enjoys the series but hasn't read the books, and she said that it didn't seem like as much happened as compared to the 7th episode.

Secondly, shame on you George R. R. Martin for writing your “can’t-put-it-down” medieval-fantasy saga. As soon as I started watching the HBO series, I immediately purchased all four books of “A Song of Ice and Fire” saga.<br /><br />My original plan was to follow each HBO episode by reading the corresponding chapters in “A Game of Thrones.” Needless to say, that only lasted through two episodes, as once I picked up the first book, I could not put it down.<br /><br />I am now half-way through the fourth book. Over the past two months, your novels have been all-consuming. I have abandoned two other novels that remain partially read on my bedside table; my husband has gone without clean clothes (he hates going commando); my Pergo floors now appear to be carpeted due to dog hair and lack of vacuuming; writing assignments are piling up; dinner is always late; and night-after-night I keep my husband awake into the wee hours of the morning, with pages turning and my Itty Bitty book light blazing.<br /><br />As much as I try to drag myself away from your medieval soap opera, the story and characters keep pulling me back. I’m uncertain if I should thank you or curse you. One thing I do know is that my life has been enriched through your imaginative tale.<br /><br />I’m looking forward to the next novel in your series and watching HBO breath life into your “A Song of Ice and Fire” saga.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Dee Marie<br />Author of the “Sons of Avalon” saga<br />www.sonsofavalon.com","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 8 2011, 13:34:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"My Song of Ice and Fire","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Dee_Marie_SOA","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Dee_Marie_SOA","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_652716","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=38655986&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Dee_Marie_SOA","ctime_ts":1307540090,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119999208/28767563","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13784572#t13784572","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13784572#t13784572","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13784572#t13784572","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"metally_mean","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://metally-mean.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13784572,"talkid":53845,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/220156.html?thread=13784572#t13784572","upictitle":"Mariana: vampire queen","article":"congratulations on the nominations. i hope GoT will win!
