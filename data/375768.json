{"itemid":1467,"subject":"Father's Day Finale","event":"Tonight the Season 4 finale of GAME OF THRONES on HBO.\r\n\r\nLongest episode of the season.&nbsp; One of the things I love about HBO is that you can take as long as you need to tell your story, you&#39;re not locked into the rigid 46-minutes-and-change-to-the-second of the broadcast networks.&nbsp; This one will go 1:16, it says.&nbsp; Cool.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/206649/206649_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Arya 4-10.jpg\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/206649/206649_600.jpg\" title=\"Arya 4-10.jpg\" /></a>\r\ncredit: Helen Sloan/ HBO\r\n\r\nStrongest episode of the season?&nbsp; Might be.&nbsp; Clearly David and Dan think so, since they&#39;ve chosen &quot;The Children&quot; to represent GAME OF THRONES in the writing category of the Emmy Awards.&nbsp; We&#39;ve had a LOT of powerful episodes this season, so that says something.&nbsp; I have not seen the episode myself yet, but I am looking forward to it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/206995/206995_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Dany 4-10\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/206995/206995_600.jpg\" title=\"Dany 4-10\" /></a>\r\ncredit: Macall D.
