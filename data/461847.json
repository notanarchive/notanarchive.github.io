{"itemid":1804,"subject":"Evil Foiled!  Good Triumphant!  Jets Win, Jets Win, Jets Win!!!","event":"Hey, the Jets won!  Life is magical and full of joy!\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, it was not the SuperBowl or anything, just a regular season game.  But it was against the New England Patriots, the Horror Out of Boston, the Blue-and-White Walkers from Beyond the Wall, led by Evil Little Bill himself.  The Jets always lose to the Patriots, usually in an especially painful fashion.  Like they did earlier this season, in Foxboro.  But this time they <i><b>WON!</b></i>\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, they are not in the playoffs yet.  New England still wins the division  (They always win the division, it is so bloody BORING).  Gang Green does not even a wild card slot... though now at least they control their own destiny.  If they can defeat Rex and his Buffalo Bills next week, they'll be in the dance.\r\n\r\nI will worry about that next week, however.  Tonight I savor.  (Yes, I know, the Giants play later.  AGainst the Vikings.  Don't remind me.  I am savoring).\r\n\r\nAs for this morning's game... kudos to Fitz, who played a terrific game aside from that fumble.  Kudos to Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker, our terrific one-two punch.  Kudos to the running backs, especially Bilal Powell, who played his best game as a Jets.  Kudos to the D, who kept Tom Brady on his heels for much of the game.  Kudos to our coaching staff... and, especially, kudos to our terrific new GM, who assembled all these pieces.\r\n\r\nAll these kudos aside, though, Gang Green did almost lose this one.  After dominating for most of the first three quarters, they let the Pats get back into it and tie in up in the fourth.  A Fitz fumble run back for a TD started the bad stuff, but three bad offensive series in the last quarter compounded the difficulties.  No first downs, no time run off the clock... you can't give Brady that kind of opening.  So of course he made not one but TWO crucial fourth down conversions, and of course he threw the tying TD with two minutes left.  I could feel the victory slipping away as we went to overtime, and the stake was poised above my heart... they tossed the coin, and the Pats won, and the darkness was closing in around me as it has so many times before... \r\n\r\nOnly then the Pats chose to kick off.  Instead of receiving, and putting the hands of Tom Brady, the most dangerous mutha in football, Evil Little Bill decided that Fitz and the Jets should have it.  Hee hee.  Hoo ha.  Oh, sweet.  Thanks, Bill.  What a lovely Christmas present.\r\n\r\nFitz took the ball and drove Gang Green right down the field for the winning TD.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all she wrote.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"657\"/>","ditemid":461847,"eventtime":"2015-12-27 16:52:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Dec 27 23:52:28 2015]R [Sun Dec 27 23:52:30 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/681261401650761728 ","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1451683417,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/681261401650761728","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.742083410561658]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451260396}","revtime":1451693528},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-27 23:52:24","anum":23,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461847.html","event_timestamp":1451235120,"reply_count":26,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110978466/9476808","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461847.html?thread=23341079#t23341079","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461847.html?thread=23341079#t23341079","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461847.html?thread=23341079#t23341079","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ectypes","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ectypes.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23341079,"talkid":91176,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461847.html?thread=23341079#t23341079","upictitle":"i hear you made-out with a goblin oh my gawwwwd: SANSA MY LUB","article":"See you at the Ralph, George.
