{"itemid":13,"subject":"an honor just to be nominated...","event":"The Hugo ballot is out, and A FEAST FOR CROWS is one of the finalists in the \"Best Novel\" category.  Thanks, to everyone who nominated me... and to those who didn't as well, so long as you nominated someone.  We need more people to take part the nominating process.  Win or lose, it IS an honor just to be on the ballot.\r\n\r\nI was also thrilled to see that Howard Waldrop is up in Novelette.  Howard has few peers as a short fiction writer, and is long overdue for a Hugo.  Maybe this year...\r\n\r\nElsewise, though, the ballot does not thrill me.  I was disappointed that the SOUTH PARK's \"Trapped in the Closet\" did not make the list in Short Form/ Drama, particularly in light of current efforts to make certain the episode is never shown again.  And how Alan Lee and John Howe can continue to be overlooked in the Best Artist category, year after year after year after year, never ceases to astonish me.  \r\n\r\nHere's the full list of nominees, courtesy of the good folks at LACon IV:\r\n\r\nBest Novel \r\n(430 ballots cast) \r\nLearning the World, Ken MacLeod (Orbit; Tor) \r\nA Feast for Crows, George R.R.
