I guess this is either Storms End or Seaguard? Maybe Storms End because it looks like it has great defences. Maybe Seaguard cause it looks like a boy (Rickon?) in the boat and Rickon goes there after the fall of Winterfell.<br /><br />2) At 20 seconds into the trailer it shows a man in a hood tied to a rack. I'm guessing that this is Reek. To not reveal any spoilers I'll simply say that his name sounds like Peek and this means we will probably see another Bastard this Season (Yay!).<br /><br />3) Quick shot of Thoros duelling Sandor Clegane at 32 seconds into the trailer. (Took me over 10 viewings to spot it) :D<br /><br />Verdict on the trailer is that it rules and has a great song. Darker feel than alot of the Season 2 trailers. Would like the next trailer to have some shots or Riverrun, Tully's, Tyrells and also a bit longer. 1 minute trailers are good but 2 minute trailer are like TWICE as good.   <br /><br /><br /><br />4) ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"February 24 2013, 02:22:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Questions ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/MarxistCore","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"MarxistCore","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1667549","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=60711278&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"MarxistCore","ctime_ts":1361672523,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/101985364/13664907","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313318.html?thread=17292518#t17292518","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313318.html?thread=17292518#t17292518","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313318.html?thread=17292518#t17292518","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"brijeana","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://brijeana.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17292518,"talkid":67548,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313318.html?thread=17292518#t17292518","upictitle":"brijeana: Indiaarie - Happy","article":"Thank you.
