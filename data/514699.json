{"itemid":2010,"subject":"Bad Presidents ","event":"Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.\r\n \r\n But sometimes fiction can take truth and turn it up to eleven.\r\n\r\n We all know how the recent presidential election turned out in the real world.  Hilary Clinton won by three million votes, but Donald Trump is going to take office in a week and a half, thanks to the electoral college, James Comey, and some Russian hackers.   I've seen a lot of Trump voters saying, yes, Trump was bad, but they thought Clinton was worse, so... lesser of two evils and all that.  (FWIW, I don't think Hilary was evil, but even if we accept that premise, no way she was the lesser when up against the Pussygrabber-in-Chief).\r\n\r\n I don't want to talk real world politics here, however.  We've done a lot of that this past year, and we have four more years of it ahead of us.   \r\n\r\n Instead I want to expand the \"choice of evils\" template with a little thought experiment, and weigh Trump against some fictional presidents and presidential candidates.  \r\n\r\n So... if the recent presidential election had pitted Donald Trump against Francis Underwood (HOUSE OF CARDS) and Gregg Hartmann (WILD CARDS), who would <i><b>you</b></i> have voted for?  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/408228/408228_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/408494/408494_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/408675/408675_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n And if you don't know who Gregg Hartmann is... well, go check out our new Wild Cards website at http://www.wildcardsworld.com/ .  Our plan is to keep the site fresh with blog posts every couple of weeks, and the first of those just went up: a rumination by Stephen Leigh on the long and storied career of Gregg Hartmann, aka Puppetman, whose saga lasted from the first volume of WILD CARDS all the way through volume fifteen.\r\n\r\n Read it and enjoy, and post your choices here: Trump, Underwood, or Hartmann.   With reasons.\r\n\r\n NO off topic comments, please.\r\n\r\n FWIW, Hartmann never did manage to achieve the White House in the Wild Cards universe.   But Leo Barnett did, so I am not sure that's a total win...","ditemid":514699,"eventtime":"2017-01-07 17:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, politics","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Jan  8 00:36:17 2017]R [Sun Jan  8 00:36:18 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/817892651064291328 ","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1484004390,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/817892651064291328","reading_time":4,"ratingbot_comment":"[cyr:-|ua:-|noncyr:15|by:-|ru:-|rureg:-]","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.643594058321561]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1483835803}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2010?v=1484036274","revtime":1483990275},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-08 00:36:16","anum":139,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html","event_timestamp":1483810560,"reply_count":68,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122955553/69417476","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25502603#t25502603","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25502603#t25502603","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25502603#t25502603","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2481276","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/MatthiasSchipp","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25502603,"talkid":99619,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25502603#t25502603","upictitle":"Matthias Schipper: pic#122955553","article":"Underwood.

A few rules of thumb, for me: <br /><br />1) Intelligent evil is better than stupid evil, in most circumstances. An intelligent evil leader will hurt people and screw people over, but might be foresighted enough to still do things that keep the country running well, as doing so is in his/her best interests. It's easier to stay in power if the country hasn't been reduced to rubble under your administration.<br /><br />By contrast, a stupid and/or irrational evil leader is likely to crash the country into the ground without even understanding that this is what they're doing. They'll make bad decision after bad decision, simultaneously harming the country and harming the people around them, all the while blaming everyone but themselves until all that's left is smoking wreckage.<br /><br />In short, a Tywin or a Littlefinger is preferable to a Joffrey or a Cersei, and so Francis Underwood is preferable to Trump. I don't have enough exposure to Gregg Hartmann's history to say one way or the other about him, and the article you linked didn't go into enough detail to lead me one way or the other, but if most of his villainy is confined to personal acts of torture and murder he's still preferable to someone who ruins millions of lives through sheer ineptitude.<br /><br />On that note:<br /><br />2) Small scale evil/ineptitude is preferable to large scale evil/ineptitude. I don't want a serial killer or a wife beater or a pedophile for President, but I'd take one over an otherwise moral and decent man who consistently acts impulsively and without regard for long term consequences, above all if such impulsive acts could reach up to the level of 'ends human civilization via nuclear war because he was in a bad mood.' Scale matters. So yeah, if Gregg Hartmann goes around torturing individual people but doesn't let his 'hobby' intrude on his governance (Roose over Ramsey), he's still a better choice than a man who openly says things like 'why do we have nuclear weapons if we can't use them.'<br /><br />3) I'll take selfishness and cynicism over ideological fanaticism. This is Trump's one saving grace: he is, at bottom, a selfish narcissist who very doubtfully believes a large portion of the things he says. A man who lines his pockets at the public expense is bad, but endurable. It's the Hitlers and the Maos and the Stalins, the fanatical believers in causes which necessitated the mass deaths of millions of people, who are the most frightening.<br /><br />Of course, this is broad strokes stuff. A stupid evil leader might make such enormous mistakes so quickly that they bury themselves in short order, in which case such a leader would be preferable to the scumbag who can hide his malevolence for years. Still, on the whole, I'd take either of these fictional characters over Trump, though with the reminder that I know very little about Hartmann and could change my mind.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 8 2017, 02:29:56 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sdschaffer.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sdschaffer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sdschaffer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sdschaffer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sdschaffer","ctime_ts":1483842596,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25508747#t25508747","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25508747#t25508747","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25508747#t25508747","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3963539","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/110177097002671206307","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25508747,"talkid":99643,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514699.html?thread=25508747#t25508747","upictitle":"Zack Needham: pic#0","article":"Trump.<br /><br />Underwood is cold, and I don't know much about Hartmann.
