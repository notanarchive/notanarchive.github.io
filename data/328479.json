It is not Dunk & Egg <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%234\">#4</a> (which will come out somewheres between The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring), but it is called 'The Princess and the Queen'.<br /><br />From the ASOIAF wiki:<br /><br />\"The Princess and the Queen is a novella consisting of material written by George R.R. Martin for The World of Ice and Fire but cut when it ran drastically over-length. Rather than lose the material, Martin decided to publish it in his anthology Dangerous Women. It replaces the fourth Dunk and Egg short story, The She-Wolves, which will instead be published later in a different venue. <br />The Dance of Dragons began in 129 AL, one hundred and sixty-nine years before the events of A Game of Thrones. It was the conflict that saw most of the lesser branches of House Targaryen and almost all of its dragons destroyed. <br />The Princess and the Queen is a narrative history, taking place at the outbreak of the Dance of Dragons.\" <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"July 25 2013, 16:30:02 UTC","parent":18003487,"massactions":0,"subject":"Dangerous Women GRRM FAQ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"insurrbution","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"insurrbution","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"insurrbution","ctime_ts":1374769802,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/328479.html?thread=18006559#t18006559","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/328479.html?thread=18006559#t18006559","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/328479.html?thread=18006559#t18006559","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wcbryan80","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wcbryan80.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18006559,"talkid":70338,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/328479.html?thread=18006559#t18006559","upictitle":"wcbryan80: pic#0","article":"Can't wait, I am simply an anthology junkie and yours and Gardner's are always at the top of my to read list.
