{"itemid":1679,"subject":"Podcast from Greywater","event":"A million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the earth and I looked more or less like the guy in the picture there, (1972, actually), I took a train down from Chicago, where I was living and working at the time, to Kansas City.  There, at the very first KC science fiction convention, MidAmericaCon (not to be confused with the later worldcon, MidAmericon), I met Howard Waldrop.  H'ard and I had been corresponding for almost a decade, since the fall of 1963, when I bought a copy of BRAVE AND BOLD #28 from him for a quarter.  But he lived in Texas, and I lived in New Jersey, and never the twain had met.\r\n\r\nTill KC.\r\n\r\nWe were both fledgling sf writers at the time, each of us with a few short story sales under our belt.  When we met, we did what fledgling writers often did in those days: we decided to write a story together.  We actually left the Playboy Club atop the con hotel to begin it.  (Probably just as well.  Beers were real expensive up there, I recall -- a whole quarter).\r\n\r\nWe only wrote a few pages at the con, but we kept at it afterwards, sending the manuscript back and forth, until it was done.  \"Men of Greywater Station,\" we called it.  Pretty much everybody in the field rejected it until it finally got to the lowest paying magazine, where it was purchased and, finally, published.  The readers seemed to like it well enough.\r\n\r\nHoward and I remain close friends to this day, but we never collaborated again.  Our styles were just too different.  But it was fun doing it once.\r\n\r\nAnd now, all these years later, it's been done as a podcast by Starship Sofa:\r\n\r\n http://www.starshipsofa.com/blog/2015/06/03/starshipsofa-no-389-george-r-r-martin/ \r\n\r\nCheck it out for yourself.  It's free, and I thought they did a nice job.","ditemid":429952,"eventtime":"2015-06-10 23:53:00","props":{"current_mood":"nostalgic","current_location":"the moors of memory","taglist":"short stories, old times, audiobooks","current_moodid":60,"commentalter":1434429940,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Podcast from Greywater http://goo.gl/I58Smu","picture_keyword":"torcon","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.652012524467538]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1434002036}","revtime":1434474549},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-06-11 05:53:12","anum":128,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429952.html","event_timestamp":1433980380,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429952.html?thread=21764480#t21764480","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429952.html?thread=21764480#t21764480","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429952.html?thread=21764480#t21764480","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3185148","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/117745118469835791326","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21764480,"talkid":85017,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429952.html?thread=21764480#t21764480","article":"Greywater Station.

I also wanted to thank you for sharing the interesting tidbit about the writing of your story \"Men of Greywater Station\" with Howard Waldrop.  Reading that name and the good memories it triggered for me is what lead me to register and write this lil' internet post to you.  <br /><br />Seeing the name Howard Waldrop........lead me to instantly think the phrase \"A helluva writer, a helluva friend, and a fevered dreamer if ever there was one.\"  Ok, well, I cheated a little and used my old, yellowed paperback version of Fevre Dream to confirm the EXACT wording, but I knew instantaneously that this was the person to whom you dedicated Fevre Dream.  The good memories that name and remembered phrasing brought me has lead me here to thank you for it all. <br /><br />I had peeked in to look for word of ASOIAF, TWOW, and anything of interest, and instead......the name Howard Waldrop reminded me of my teens and my youth, of a fevered, all night read of a novel, and of my gratitude to you for my LOVE OF BYRON, not Bryon.  For all those memories, and for all the books, and for the fevred dreaming, I truly thank you.<br /><br />As you wrestle with Young Kong and the internet, surrounded by puppies, just remember, there are many out there who are appreciative for both the work and for all it makes us feel.<br /><br />Good Luck and Don't let the internet crazies get to you.  <br />Thanks again and enjoy.  <br /><br />Edited to correct the name Byron, George Gordon, Lord Byron.

For example, in your co-authored novel \"Windhaven\", Wikipedia (what a source!) implies Lisa Tuttle mostly wrote the book, but the characterisations, descriptions, and dialogue sound, to me, as though you mostly wrote it, based on everything else I've read of yours (which is pretty much everything you've published). Plus, there are place names in the book used later in ASOIAF, such as the Iron Islands and the Eyrie, which I associate entirely with 'you'... and if Tuttle did help you come up with these, she today gets absolutely no credit at all for the names! I write [obviously unpublished] fiction of my own, and I can't imagine sharing any of it with another writer, not even one single line. And so I can't see a writing collaboration as being anything more than an experiment, something to *do* at a specific time, rather than something a writer might invest a part of their soul in... I imagine exchanging manuscripts, like you say, and then when my turn comes up, there I am, cringing at a turn the story has taken, and maybe even losing the desire to continue writing... Then again, I'm incredibly picky.
