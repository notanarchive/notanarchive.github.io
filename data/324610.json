I'll just get to it then...He mentioned that he believes the life of the show is likely to be 7 seasons (I'm sure adding a season isn't off the table) which makes sense as far as carrying an audience goes.  <br /><br /><br />That being said, I'm sure you know where this is headed.  The concern being that we (the readers) end up seeing the nuts and bolts finale on HBO before getting a chance to read it.  I'm not one of those people who gets angry when you watch football, or talk about something other than ASOIF.  Nor am I one who wants to rush your work at all, and I think you understand that your readers would be devistated if the ending is shown on TV before A Dream of Spring is released.<br /><br />It is very much public knowledge that there were timeline/plot issues with the last 2 installments and thus the writing was arduous process for you.  Therefore, among other reasons you are very hesitant to give any predictions as far as a release date for Winds of Winter goes.  That is perfectly understandable, but for your loyal readers sanity could you maybe throw us a little info as far as progress is concerned.  Maybe like a quarterly or semi-annual update?  <br /><br />I have no doubt that you are doing everything in your power to make sure the last 2 books are out before HBO gives us the conclusion.  The real concern for most of us that have been reading your books since the mid to late 90's isn't that it takes too long between books, its that our being on the bandwagon since the beginning will end up being for not.  I can't think of a less satisfying way to find out who sits the iron throne than scrolling through my FaceBook feed and seeing it there.  Or reading it in Entertainment Weekly that my wife gets.<br /><br />I have little faith that this will get to you, as I'm sure this will message will be flagged as some sort of disgruntled fanmail.  But, if you do read this I just wanted you to know most of us (I've talked to an usual amount of other readers about this topic) are not angry over the length of time between books, although I admit there are those that are, we are just concerned readers that our loyalty/faith will lose out to the TV show watchers that came on board 2 years ago.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"May 23 2013, 23:54:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Producers Comments","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://profiles.google.com/113864229570379637397","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ext_1772478","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1772478","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=63230337&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ext_1772478","ctime_ts":1369353278,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17771778#t17771778","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17771778#t17771778","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17771778#t17771778","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17771778,"talkid":69421,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17771778#t17771778","above":17751042,"upictitle":"George R.R.

As William Goldmann once famously observed, nobody knows anything.<br /><br />The books are the books, the show is the show.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"June 2 2013, 18:39:40 UTC","parent":17751042,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Producers Comments","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1370198380,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116131088/45519721","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17751298#t17751298","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17751298#t17751298","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17751298#t17751298","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"superscienceser","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://superscienceser.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17751298,"talkid":69341,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/324610.html?thread=17751298#t17751298","upictitle":"superscienceser: pic#116131088","article":"Would love to see you come to a con in the Queen city, aka Charlotte.
