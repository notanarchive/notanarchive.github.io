Sometimes I just want to make a big fire and burn everything I wrote so the idea of being a writer gets out of my head, because maybe it's not my destiny.  <br />But then I read your books and the books of many other authors that I also admire and I tell myself that this is excatly what I want to be. <br />For many years I have been trying to publish one of my first novels and I've decided that if this year no one is interested in it I'll cross that Wall and try abroad, although I still don't know any editors that could be interested in the genre. <br />I'm now rewriting something I wrote when I was 12, because I really like the idea although my style has changed within the years and I know I can do it better. This story in particular happens in a fictional world and I've started creating its geography on a clearer way and thinking about that world's history, regardless from the characters actions. <br />Do you think I'm starting things right or do you recomend me to start with something else first? What did you start with when you created the land of Westeros, without going insane?<br />If you could give me your advice I will be obliged. And even if you find the time to reply me or not, well, I wanted to write you at least once.  <br />Sorry for my bad english, it's been a while since I have practiced it. <br /><br />Kind regards, <br /><br />Clara Gillman","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"June 13 2014, 16:37:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Dear George ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/lestrom","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Claire Hirondelle Gillman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2630742","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=71251188&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"June 14 2014, 15:44:22 UTC","dname":"Claire Hirondelle Gillman","ctime_ts":1402677459,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375353.html?thread=19274041#t19274041","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375353.html?thread=19274041#t19274041","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375353.html?thread=19274041#t19274041","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19274041,"talkid":75289,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375353.html?thread=19274041#t19274041","above":19271481,"upictitle":"George R.R.
