North Korea claims themselves \"Socialists\" yet they have absolutely nothing in common with Socialism or Communism, if they truly were a socialist state they would be in a much better situation than they are in now. <br /><br />They also claim they are a \"self-dependent state\"... if that's true tell me why are they kissing the arses of the United States, Russia, China, and yes even South Korea for food aid? North Korea pretends as a badass that scares other nations of their \"great power\" yet they never show the side of when they are complete ass lickers. The United States - the country North Korea wants to nuke so badly - has provided countless humanitarian aid effort to North Korea, especially during the 1990s when the country faced severe flooding and devastation of crops.<br /><br />Why would anyone in there right mind be afraid of North Korea is beyond me...Instead of fearing this sorry state people should be pitying them...Then again we have cowards like Sony that are to afraid to release a movie because the big bad fat boy may get his feelings hurt and will retaliate by sending his cyber army to destroy anyone caught watching The Interview. <br /><br />Last I checked Saddam Hussein and his Iraq also had weapons of mass destruction and an image of fear throughout the world. Didn't take too long for him to get eradicated did it? And his military wasn't made up of 4\"9 foot soldiers suffering from starvation.  <br /><br />North Korea needs to wake up and get a hold of itself immediately...They have no allies to speak of, yes China hates them as well, their environment is in devastation with barely any fertile land to produce agriculture, the North Korean people are starving to death, and their nuclear program is dependent on other countries such as Russia, Pakistan, and Iran. <br /><br />They are in no situation to be bullying anyone. I will do anything and everything in my power to make sure The Interview is released worldwide playing in every single cinema or theatre.<br /><br />And to you Mr. Martin I will buy a drink.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 23 2014, 19:17:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Who is North Korea for God&#39;s sake?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nelson-rathbone.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nelson_rathbone","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nelson_rathbone","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nelson-rathbone.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nelson_rathbone","ctime_ts":1419362257,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124388667/73669178","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398258.html?thread=19975858#t19975858","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398258.html?thread=19975858#t19975858","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398258.html?thread=19975858#t19975858","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2934379","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/nick.jensen.5895","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19975858,"talkid":78030,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398258.html?thread=19975858#t19975858","upictitle":"Nick Jensen: pic#124388667","article":"well, that is a small win for free speech...
