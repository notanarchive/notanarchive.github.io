{"itemid":1013,"subject":"Golden Globes","event":"It's awards season in Hollywood, and I'm out in Los Angeles in the thick of it.\r\n\r\nOn Friday I attended the American Film Institute luncheon with David (Benioff), Dan (weiss), Emilia (Clarke), Jason (Momoa) and other stalwarts from HBO, where GAME OF THRONES was honored as one of the ten outstanding television shows of 2011.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon it's the Golden Globes, given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.  The AFI luncheon was a relaxed affair, since we already knew that we were getting the award before turning up.  The Globes are an altogether different proposition; like the Emmys (and the Hugos), they're nail biters, where all the nominees sweat it out until the envelope  is torn open.  (And the bigger celebrities also need to worry about what host Ricky Gervais might say about them).  GAME OF THRONES is up for best drama against some pretty tough competition.  BOARDWALK EMPIRE and HOMELAND are the two favorites going in... but GOT is very popular overseas, so maybe we have a shot at an upset.  Peter Dinklage is also nominated, for supporting actor... he's a strong contender, I think.\r\n\r\nSo... tune in tonight, and keep your fingers (and toes) crossed.\r\n\r\n((And yeah, the Giants are playing the Packers at the same time.  Very annoying of them to schedule it like that.  Go G-Men!!  Go Eli!  Cruz, Cruz, Cruuuuz!))","ditemid":259524,"eventtime":"2012-01-15 13:01:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl, awards, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":134,"commentalter":1326927389,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"iron throne","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1327260320},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-01-15 20:01:44","anum":196,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/259524.html","event_timestamp":1326632460,"reply_count":42,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109915172/10560429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/259524.html?thread=15258308#t15258308","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/259524.html?thread=15258308#t15258308","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/259524.html?thread=15258308#t15258308","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nycfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15258308,"talkid":59602,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/259524.html?thread=15258308#t15258308","upictitle":"nycfalcon: pic#109915172","article":"It's Hollywood.
