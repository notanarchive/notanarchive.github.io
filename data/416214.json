I'm a huge fan of ASOIAF and rap music.  In early March, Kid Cudi, some rapper you've never heard of, released a song called \"love\".  I have no reason to believe that Kid Cudi intentionally made this song about Rhaegar but every time I listen to the song Rhaegar is all I can think about.  If you want to give it a listen I posted a link to its audio file and its lyrics.  Hope you enjoy and share my same fascination with the parallels between Rhaegar Targaryen, my favorite ASOIAF character, and the song's main character.  <br /><br /><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Q1xJyVze0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Q1xJy<wbr />Vze0</a>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 4 2015, 00:08:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Rhaegar&#39;s Theme Song?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://aurazell.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"aurazell","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"aurazell","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://aurazell.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"aurazell","ctime_ts":1428106106,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/416214.html?thread=20591830#t20591830","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/416214.html?thread=20591830#t20591830","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/416214.html?thread=20591830#t20591830","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20591830,"talkid":80436,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/416214.html?thread=20591830#t20591830","above":20568278,"upictitle":"George R.R.
