{"itemid":893,"subject":"Have Gel Pen, Will Travel (Part Two)","event":"Had a great birthday party for Parris yesterday (thanks to Melinda for lending us her house).  Today I try to catch up a bit on my email.  Tomorrow morning I am back on the road again.  First stop is the San Diego Comicon.  I will post some more about SDCC a bit later.  After that, it's the second half of my DANCE WITH DRAGONS book tour.\r\n\r\nThe schedule:\r\n\r\nSAN DIEGO\r\nJuly 24, 4:00 p.m.            Mysterious Galaxy, 7051 Clairemont Mesa Blvd\r\n\r\nLOS ANGELES\r\nJuly 26, 7:00 p.m.            LOS ANGELES - Barnes & Noble, 189 The Grove Drive, Los Angeles\r\n\r\nBAY AREA\r\nJuly 27, 7:00 p.m.            REDWOOD CITY - Fox Theatre, 2215 Broadway Street, Redwood City\r\n                                       event hosted by Kepler's\r\n\r\nSEATTLE\r\nJuly 29, 7:30 p.m.            SEATTLE - Town Hall, 1119 8th Ave, Seattle\r\n                                      event hosted by University Bookstore\r\n\r\nDENVER\r\nJuly 31, 2:00 pm              DENVER - Tattered Cover LoDo, 1628 16th Street, Denver\r\n\r\nLEXINGTON\r\nAugust 2, 7:00 p.m.           LEXINGTON - Joseph-Beth Booksellers, 161 Lexington Green Circle\r\n\r\nFor more information on these signings -- including rules and procedures -- check out the story on Suvudu at http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/06/on-tour-george-r-r-martin.html?ref=twt_Suvudu_stream or contact the individual bookstores.\r\n\r\nAs for all those places I am NOT visiting (sorry, sorry, but I can't tour forever, can't go everywhere)... there are still ways you can get an autographed book.  Try contacting some of the bookstores on the tour.  Most of them would be glad to take your mailorder, I'm sure.  \r\n\r\nYou can also try the Signed Page at http://signedpage.com/  They specialize in selling signed books via mailorder, and I will be swinging by their cavernous warehouse on my tour, to scrawl illegibly in all of their pre-orders.\r\n\r\n(Sorry again, but no personalizations this tour, just signatures).\r\n\r\nSee you... somewhere or other, I hope.  And if I look a little dazed and don't seem to know what city I am in, well, do forgive...","ditemid":228770,"eventtime":"2011-07-19 10:59:00","props":{"current_location":"home again","taglist":"a dance with dragons, signings","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1312483173,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1312578915},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-19 16:59:50","anum":162,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/228770.html","event_timestamp":1311073140,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/228770.html?thread=14328226#t14328226","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/228770.html?thread=14328226#t14328226","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/228770.html?thread=14328226#t14328226","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dlesh77","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dlesh77.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14328226,"talkid":55969,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/228770.html?thread=14328226#t14328226","upictitle":"dlesh77: pic#0","article":"FYI for those who want to go to the Mysterious Galaxy signing and dont have a ticket.
