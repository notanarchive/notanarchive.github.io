That said, I'm a fan of (what vulture lists) :<br /><br />- Mad Men<br />- Neil Gaiman (haven't read much of his stuff...read and liked Stardust, also want to read American Gods and Anansi Boys)<br />- Bruce is pretty good, especially 'Born to to Run' and 'The Promise'<br />- Star Trek (just the tech, mythos and universe is far better than Star Wars)<br />- Community. Definitely a hit. Angie's a total cutie.<br />- Joss Whedon (for Buffy and Serenity/firefly)<br />- Hunger Games (only read the books though)<br />- Lord of the Rings (and some other Tolkien stuff...did you know Tolkien wanted LotR (as one volume) and The Silmarillion published together as a duology called 'The Saga of the Jewels and the Rings'?)<br />- Harry Potter (both films and books)<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"October 17 2012, 22:54:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"insurrbution","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"insurrbution","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"insurrbution","ctime_ts":1350514491,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119082952/53431853","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294684.html?thread=16736796#t16736796","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294684.html?thread=16736796#t16736796","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294684.html?thread=16736796#t16736796","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1451214","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/justin.voss.31","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16736796,"talkid":65378,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294684.html?thread=16736796#t16736796","upictitle":"Justin Voss: pic#119082952","article":"Then maybe you could reward us with a fresh sample chapter!
