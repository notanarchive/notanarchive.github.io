{"itemid":133,"subject":"Page One Signing","event":"What with all the thrills and chills on SuperBowl Sunday, I never got around to posting about the previous day's excitement, the big INSIDE STRAIGHT launch party and autographing at Page One Bookstore in Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nThe signing was a huge success.  Seven of the nine contributors to INSIDE STRAIGHT were on hand to autograph copies of the book; Caroline Spector flew in from Texas and Carrie Vaughn drove down from Colorado, and Melinda Snodgrass, John Jos. Miller, Daniel Abraham, Ian Tregillis, and I were there representing for New Mexico.  A number of other Wild Cards writers also turned up to cheer us on, and join us for a reception afterward, so sharp-eyed collectors could also snag signatures from Victor Milan, Walter Jon Williams, Gail Gerstner Miller, Sage Walker, and Laura J. Mixon.\r\n\r\nAnd the fans turned out in droves.  They filled up all the seats pretty quickly, and after that it was standing room only.  The autograph line went on and on, winding back through the cafe and into the stacks.  I think it was the biggest signing I've ever had in New Mexico, even larger than the turnout we got for A FEAST FOR CROWS.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who were not able to attend the event, we did sign some stock for Page One, and while that stock lasts you should still be able to get a copy signed by me and six of my writers by ordering via the Page One website at http://www.page1book.com/\r\n\r\nOur thanks to the good folks at Page One, to our editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden and our ace agent Kay McCauley, and to all the readers who turned out to make the event such a success. \r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00002drs/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00002drs/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"194\" border='0'/></a>","ditemid":34114,"eventtime":"2008-02-06 12:39:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":289,"commentalter":1202420455,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","verticals_list":"culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-06 19:55:18","anum":66,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html","event_timestamp":1202301540,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67778651/4852452","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?replyto=3401794","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3401794#t3401794","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3401794#t3401794","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3401794#t3401794","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"webmonkeyjr","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://webmonkeyjr.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3401794,"talkid":13288,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3401794#t3401794","upictitle":"Just Another Mike: Webmonkeyjr","article":"Do you have plans to come to Maryland or DC any time soon?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 6 2008, 20:11:25 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://webmonkeyjr.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"webmonkeyjr","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"webmonkeyjr","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://webmonkeyjr.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"webmonkeyjr","ctime_ts":1202328685,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?replyto=3403330","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3403330#t3403330","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3403330#t3403330","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3403330#t3403330","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3403330,"talkid":13294,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/34114.html?thread=3403330#t3403330","above":3401794,"upictitle":"George R.R.
