{"itemid":888,"subject":"Three Days...","event":"... and counting.\r\n\r\nTomorrow I set off on the first leg of my signing tour.  My first stop will be... well, I shouldn't say, since I won't be doing any public appearances there, just swinging by the Random House warehouse on Monday and signing as many copies of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS as I can manage to sign before catching the Acela to Boston that afternoon.   Those copies will go out all over the country, to bookstores that are not on the tour, but have placed substantial orders.\r\n\r\nThe first public signing is in Boston.  Well, Burlington, actually.  Look for me at the Barnes & Noble, 98 Middlesex Turnpike, starting at 7pm and going to... well, to when they close the store presumably.  I'll say a few words, take a few questions, and then deface your books.\r\n\r\nAfter Boston, I'll be at the Union Square B&N in New York City, and then the Carmel B&N in Indianapolis.  (Full details on the Appearances page of my website).  Then it's home for a brief respite before I depart for San Diego Comicon and the second leg of the tour.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ed35c/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ed35c/s640x480\" width=\"315\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the post my publisher put up on Suvudu:\r\nhttp://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/06/on-tour-george-r-r-martin.html?ref=twt_Suvudu_stream\r\n\r\nI don't want to disappoint anyone, so let me stress again that, because of the size of the crowds that we're anticipating, I cannot do personalizations or inscriptions at these events.  Just straight autographs.  I wish that wasn't so, but it is.  And I won't be able to pose for photographs either, though you're certainly free to have your friend take a snapshot when I'm signing your book.\r\n\r\nThe number of items I can sign at each event will depend on the store, the crowd, and other variables.\r\n\r\nBe aware, if you head out to one of these, that (1) you may need to wait in line for a very long time, and (2) when you finally reach the front of that line, we'll only have a few second together, at best.  ((The BEST place to actually meet me, or any of your favorite SF or fantasy writers, is not at a booksigning, but at a con.  But booksignings are good places to meet other fans.  You'll definitely meet the people in line with you.  You'll be spending hours with 'em, so be friendly.  Romances have been known to start waiting in line at booksignings.))\r\n\r\nAnd if all that hasn't scared you off... see you in Boston!","ditemid":227484,"eventtime":"2011-07-09 20:44:00","props":{"current_location":"home... for now","taglist":"a dance with dragons, signings","current_moodid":120,"commentalter":1311693656,"give_features":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-10 02:44:00","anum":156,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html","event_timestamp":1310244240,"reply_count":106,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117094227/2289645","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?replyto=14212252","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14212252#t14212252","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14212252#t14212252","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14212252#t14212252","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jere7my","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14212252,"talkid":55516,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14212252#t14212252","upictitle":"jere7my: Glasses","article":"I would bike up to Burlington for an autograph, but I'll be dancing my feet off on Cape Cod instead.

Queen of Thorns","article":"but next year, 2012, we will be going to Semana Negra. Semana Negra is always a good time and an excellent event to meet many writers, artists and journalists from all over the world. As an added bonus, there's a huge carnival with rides and foods and all sorts of good fun, wrapped around the 'literary' convention! The convention also draws many publishers, recording companies and other arts and interests, with many booths selling their goods. (I came home with a dozen cds of Asturian folk music featuring many bands that included the Asturian version of bag pipes). The 2012 Semana Negra celebrates 25 years of a unique event. Many former guests are planning on attending, so there will be more chances to meet many creative people who have attended Semana Negra in the past.<br /><br />Since you are a Spanish fan, you might want to visit the Spanish fan groups web site if you haven't already - it's called Asshai, and there's a link on George's website or you can search for it online.<br /><br />The Asshai people were wonderful hosts when we visited in 2007. We had a feast that included the first public performance of \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" sung by 60+ people! They ran a one day convention in Gijon where many people wore wonderful costumes and all had a memorable evening in an old Austurian sidra hall.<br /><br />Yes, we had a lot of fun, and would love for you to join us in Gijon next year. Although, I must warn you, at this time Gigamesh has no plans to sponsor a separate book tour. That may change, depending on how fast Cristina MacÃ­a, who has translated many of George's novels and has done excellent work on on every one, can complete the translation and Gigamesh can schedule the publication. The place to look for the information on the release of the Spanish edition is:<br /><br /><a href='http://www.gigamesh.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.gigamesh.com/</a><br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 10 2011, 18:01:13 UTC","parent":14219676,"massactions":0,"subject":"no Spain this year.....","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1310320873,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14237852#t14237852","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14237852#t14237852","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14237852#t14237852","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"oxalispescaprae","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://oxalispescaprae.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14237852,"talkid":55616,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227484.html?thread=14237852#t14237852","above":14223516,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","parent":14223516,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: no Spain this year.....","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://oxalispescaprae.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"oxalispescaprae","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"oxalispescaprae","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://oxalispescaprae.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"oxalispescaprae","ctime_ts":1310478845,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0}]}
