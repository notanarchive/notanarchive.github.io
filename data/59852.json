It might be that as a kid we had all these visions of computers and space stations as this great new universe to explore, but now we've seen them, we get pummelled by them by ads, and we know they don't bring the adventure we crave.

A few things - <br /><br />First, I liked your point about \"The Road\" - this is all the rage right now in academic literary circles (this coming from one embroiled in the English Degree steeplechase), yet it is certainly science fiction in so many senses... yet the book does not bear the \"genre\" identification.    <br /><br />In so many senses fiction is simply fiction... certainly there has been a deep proclivity of the so-called \"literary fiction\" genre of late to take on a narrowing bandwidth of topics (confessions of the young, promiscuous, bi-curious, suburban mini-philosophers!), but I don't think this is a permanent state of things.<br /><br />Still... we've gotten to this place of the \"sci-fi\" section at the bookstore somehow, and I think, really, it has so much to do with the Science Fiction publishers ensuring that their work finds the eager hands of the limited public... after all, in periods of low readership, having that consistent base is useful, and in so many ways the separation model, ie \"we are different because we read science fiction,\" works so well... and this commentary regarding the \"literature of ideas\" is, as you have pointed out, a play to that ideal.  How sad that \"genre writers\" are seen as intrinsically second-class in their quality (Ms. Le Guin's point, and one I've certainly heard espoused by a number of writers working within the frameworks that most people would label F&SF), and that this style of writing is so discouraged in literary MFA programs at the moment (at least I've heard it is).  I think Card said (for what it is worth) something about the \"genre pit\" (that may not have been his exact term) - ie this idea that once someone is labelled as being a genre writer, their destiny will forever be dominated by that label, etc.  If that is so, its a terrible commentary on the compartmentalization of the publishing industry as a whole.<br /><br />I was thinking recently... there is a battle worth fighting at the moment regarding these labels, and it is not, in my mind, so very necessary to convince literature-interested folks to give a science fiction book a chance - they actually seem rather willing to flit around between the stacks... so much as it is to persuade some of the more hardcore sci-fi-only-thanks guys to give Faulkner a chance, or Pynchon, or Heller, or Saunders... something in that scary, unguided and unlabeled \"Literature\" section.  Perhaps then the links between all of the different sorts of literature will be a little more apparent to folks like Clive Thompson.  <br /><br />Food for thought, though maybe like potato-chips grade food.

I know I like fantasy better than sci-fi, but to me, sci-fi covers a wider range of topics.  I like to read about places that don't exist except in the writer's mind, but I also like to read stories that don't tax my mind too much trying to sound out the odd names that usually come alone with sci-fi.  Two things turn me off when I open a book and scan the pages to see if i might want to read it - first, if I am in a fantasy mood, if I see any word that names something I know, like New York or England I immediately close the book.  Second - the character names - if it takes me longer to sound out the names of the characters because they are just a jumble of consanants with a few vowels thrown in for good measure, I also close the book.  I hold a BA in English and like to think I am a fairly intelligent person, but if at the end of the book I am still unsure that I am pronouncing the characters' names correctly, then the aforementioned sentiment applies and I probably will not read another by the same author.  <br /><br />To me, true fantasy should come fully from the author's imagination with no connection to the real world other than the ideas that make the plot flow, whether political or religious.  (Sort of like Ice and Fire!  Love it! Love it!) And yes, fantasy is all about ideas!<br /><br />As for Ursula K Le Guin - harrumph!  She said something once about another author - I won't name names - that really ticked me off, so I don't spend my hard-earned dough on her writing!  <br /><br />I have read almost fifty books so far this year and ninety percent of them have been pure fantasy.  I might be alone in this, but I do like fantasy better than sci-fi.  (Shrugs!)
