Calm down.\r\n\r\nThis is why I hate to do updates.\r\n\r\nI say I have good day, and immediately I have a hundred people deciding this means that DANCE is finished.\r\n\r\nI'm not the oracle at Delphi.  Whatever casual comments I make on this Not A Blog are just that, and should not be subjected to analysis, interpertation, or decoding.\r\n\r\nWhen I finish DANCE, you'll know it.  I will write something like this: \"I have finished A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.\"  You won't need to parse any hints.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I have not finished A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.  I just had a particularly good day yesterday.  I hope to have another one today.","ditemid":130504,"eventtime":"2010-01-30 11:04:00","props":{"opt_nocomments":1,"taglist":"a dance with dragons","current_moodid":1,"picture_keyword":"angry","personifi_word_count":117,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"28:4,45:17,10:17,11:13,42:17,32:4,3:34,25:17,20:4,9:26,21:17","interface":"flat"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-01-30 18:04:33","anum":200,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/130504.html","event_timestamp":1264849440,"reply_count":0}
