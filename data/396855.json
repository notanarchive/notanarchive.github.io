{"itemid":1550,"subject":"Corporate Cowardice","event":"&nbsp;This one is surreal.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;In a stunning display of corporate cowardice, Regal, AMC, and&nbsp; every other major theatre chain in the United States have cancelled their plans to show the new Seth Rogen/ James Franco comedy THE INTERVIEW, because of -- yes, seriously, this is not a SOUTH PARK sketch (though I expect it soon will be) --&nbsp; threats from North Korea.\r\n\r\nNot familiar with THE INTERVIEW?&nbsp; Here&#39;s the trailer:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"526\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;I mean, really?&nbsp; REALLY??&nbsp; These gigantic corporations, most of which could buy North Korea with pocket change, are declining to show a film because Kim Jong-Un objects to being mocked?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;The level of corporate cowardice here astonishes me.&nbsp; It&#39;s a good thing these guys weren&#39;t around when Charlie Chaplin made THE GREAT DICTATOR.&nbsp; If Kim Jong-Un scares them, Adolf Hitler would have had them shitting in their smallclothes.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;Even Sony, which made the movie, is going along.&nbsp; There are thousands of small independent theatres across the country, like my own, that would gladly screen THE INTERVIEW, regardless of the threats from North Korea, but instead of shifting the film to those venues, Sony has cancelled its scheduled Christmas rollout entirely.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;I haven&#39;t seen THE INTERVIEW.&nbsp; I have no idea how good or bad a film it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be hilarious.&nbsp; It might be stupid and offensive and outrageous. (Actually, I am pretty sure about the &#39;outrageous&#39; part).&nbsp; It might be all of the above.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s not the point, though.&nbsp; Whether it&#39;s the next CITIZEN KANE or the next PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, it astonishes me that a major Hollywood film could be killed before release by threats from a foreign power and anonymous hackers.\r\n\r\nFor what it&#39;s worth, the Jean Cocteau Cinema will be glad to screen THE INTERVIEW (assuming that Sony does eventually release the film for theatrical exhibition, rather than streaming it or dumping it as a direct-to-DVD release), should it be made available to us.&nbsp; Come to Santa Fe, Seth, we&#39;ll show your film for you.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT: DECEMBER 20\r\n\r\nNot content with pulling the film, Sony has now pulled the trailers as well, so the YouTube video I embedded above no longer works.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a replacement from YouTube that&#39;s dead on point:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"529\"/>","ditemid":396855,"eventtime":"2014-12-17 21:27:00","props":{"current_mood":"pissed off","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"movies, politics, movie theatre","current_moodid":24,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1419100020,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Corporate Cowardice http://j.mp/1AfElq4","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"thumbs down","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.694964117123629]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1419005785}","revtime":1419105295},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-12-18 04:26:23","anum":55,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396855.html","event_timestamp":1418851620,"reply_count":106,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/44125447/9425322","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396855.html?thread=19887415#t19887415","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396855.html?thread=19887415#t19887415","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396855.html?thread=19887415#t19887415","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396855.html?thread=19887415#t19887415","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nathaniel","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nathaniel.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19887415,"talkid":77685,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396855.html?thread=19887415#t19887415","upictitle":"Nathaniel: shadow","article":"Hm.

In my opinion, Sony does not believe that the threats are credible, but the information they have NOT yet released is what led to this decision. It must be something that will permanently ruin Sony's image. Here is my question. If that is the case, what is stopping them from releasing it now? They have already won.

They make money and, typically, a lot of it. Maybe the film is great, maybe middling, maybe even terrible, but there's little doubt in my mind it would have at least recouped its $44 million investment. For all the people with no interest in Hobbits and Dwarves, an R-rated comedy is a popular alternate choice, especially on a Christmas release. Besides, it's already bought and paid for and advertised -- there's no way that Sony is secretly high-fiving about pulling a high-profile movie a week in front of wide-release, no matter what they think internally about the film.<br />No, Sony had no intention of bowing out. Their hand was forced by about every major theater chain (thousands of screens) making that choice for them. And Sony is humbly going along with it. Is that the smart choice? Debatable. I, for one, find it somewhat sad that the theater chains are bending over backwards for threats with no substance behind them. Though I appreciate and understand the other side of the argument, I can't help but feel that these corporations are doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. But either way, we're in the day and age where if somebody creates something another entity doesn't like, it now gets pulled. It's a dangerous precedent, and it would have been great if at least one of the major chains had flipped a big FU to North Korea and screened the movie anyhow.
