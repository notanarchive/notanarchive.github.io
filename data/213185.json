{"itemid":832,"subject":"Last Day in NYC","event":"This has been an incredible visit.  So much cool stuff to report...\r\n\r\nLast post I mentioned signing some books at the HBO store.  After that went up, the store was overrun.  All the signed books sold and people were still coming in.  So HBO shipped me another big of books and I signed them too.  The HBO shop should have autographed copies again... for a little while, at least...\r\n\r\nAnd if that doesn't work, well, I also signed all the stock at the Barnes & Noble on 45th Street and 5th Avenue.  Went by to pick up my own signed book... by Rex Ryan!  Sadly, I did not get to meet the coach, but I did get his autograph on his new book.\r\n\r\nMuch more when I get home.  And yes, that was me at THE BOOK OF MORMON last night.  Fabulous show... and it turned out I had fans among the cast who invited me backstage after the performance... that was incredibly cool at well!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g22z5/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g22z5/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe show was a delight from start to finish, which is no more than I expected from the SOUTH PARK guys.  Getting to meet some of amazingly talented cast... and learning that they were fans of my books... was surreal and wonderful.","ditemid":213185,"eventtime":"2011-05-04 12:48:00","props":{"current_location":"nyc","taglist":"travels, signed books","current_moodid":72,"commentalter":1304749729,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1305324658},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-05-04 16:45:16","anum":193,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html","event_timestamp":1304513280,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/32024547/569896","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365697#t13365697","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365697#t13365697","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365697#t13365697","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rumata","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rumata.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13365697,"talkid":52209,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365697#t13365697","article":"Hold on, this is just the beginning) Gotta have more acclaim with that book of yours.","upictitle":"Олег &quot;Зеленый&quot; Данилов: drake","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"6 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"May 4 2011, 17:10:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rumata.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rumata","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rumata","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rumata.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rumata","ctime_ts":1304529002,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/8648365/1277853","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365953#t13365953","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365953#t13365953","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365953#t13365953","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"fixnwrtr","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://fixnwrtr.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13365953,"talkid":52210,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/213185.html?thread=13365953#t13365953","upictitle":"Looking for a good word: arcimboldo","article":"On the far left, that looks like Levar Burton.
