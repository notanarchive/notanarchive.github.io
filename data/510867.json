{"itemid":1995,"subject":"Wild Cards Take Chicago","event":"New York City has been the center of the Wild Cards universe since 1946, when Dr. Tod met Jetboy in the skies over Broadway, and the Takisian xerovirus was unleashed upon the world.  It's past time the Second City got its due.   So I am thrilled to report that I've just turned in the latest Wild Cards mosaic novel: LOW CHICAGO, set entirely in the city on the lake.\r\n\r\nThis is the second book in what we're calling our 'American Triad' (MISSISSIPPI ROLL was delivered in October, and we're still hard at work on TEXAS HOLD'EM), and the twenty-fifth volume of the overall series... but no, it's not necessary to have read the first twenty-four to enjoy this one. \r\n  \r\nAnd it's a helluva ride, I think.  The cast includes old fan favorites like Mr. Nobody, Double Helix, Abigail the Understudy, Golden Boy, Natya, John Fortune, John Nighthawk, Hardhat, and the Sleeper, but some exciting new characters will be on hand as well.  Wait till you meet Meathooks, Birdbrain, and Khan.  \r\n\r\nThe table of contents:\r\nJohn Jos. Miller \"A Long Night at the Palmer House\"\r\nKevin Andrew Murphy \"Down the Rabbit Hole\"\r\nChristopher Rowe \"The Motherfucking Apotheosis of Todd Motherfucking Taszycki\"\r\nPaul Cornell \"A Bit of a Dinosaur\"\r\nMarko Kloos \"Stripes\"\r\nMelinda M. Snodgrass \"The Sister in the Streets\"\r\nMary Anne Mohanraj \"A Beautiful Facade\"\r\nSaladin Ahmed \"Meathooks on Ice\"\r\n\r\nI had a great time editing this one.  Hope you'll all like it as much as I do.\r\n\r\nAnd if you've yet to try Wild Cards, the world's longest-running shared world anthology series (thirty years and counting!)... hey, what are you waiting for!\r\n\r\nNo publication date for LOW CHICAGO yet, but you'll know as soon as Tor tells me.","ditemid":510867,"eventtime":"2016-12-11 13:08:00","props":{"current_mood":"accomplished","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, anthologies, editing","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Dec 11 20:08:04 2016]R [Sun Dec 11 20:08:05 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/808040678336798720 ","current_moodid":90,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1481762382,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/808040678336798720","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.692733129813143]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1481486914}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1995?v=1481762418","revtime":1481762412},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-11 20:08:00","anum":147,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/510867.html","event_timestamp":1481461680,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126882510/79481456","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/510867.html?thread=25389203#t25389203","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/510867.html?thread=25389203#t25389203","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/510867.html?thread=25389203#t25389203","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"javstark","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://javstark.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25389203,"talkid":99176,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/510867.html?thread=25389203#t25389203","upictitle":"Ethan J Thompson: pic#126882510","article":"I know that this question is a bit off-topic but did you happen to catch last week's Westworld Season Finale?

You and I were at Fandom II talking about role playing games D&D. I was talking about my game which is very political and gritty. So we kind of hit it off well. You explained your novels in good detail. A sharing of art forms from two fantasy creative types, we got along well. I explained my \"Superpower\" to you. I explained that I greatly liked your story, that you had told me. I explained I wanted to help out a bit. So I suggested that you talk to HBO and only HBO to sell them your story. I explained that if they(HBO) could make the Sopranos which was ending soon at that time, then they may be open to your stories too. You asked if the world was ready for a full on Drama-Fantasy series. I confirmed that I believed it was. I explained that I had made and given away the idea for the show Myth Busters to my teacher in grade 9, and that I had changed Jamie Hyneman's life. \n\nWhen Kit Harington and the cast came to Ottawa I got to meet them at Parliament Hill. I explained this to Kit, and asked him to call you and ask for verification of my meeting you. You asked if I told anyone about a \"plot point\" that you and I had started our conversation with. Something I did in a D&D game that you were going to use for your novels. I explained that I was too loyal to you, to disclose such info openly. I still am loyal to this day.\n\nDoes this remind you now?
