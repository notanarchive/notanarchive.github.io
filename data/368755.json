With knowledge of the chapter, having read it, I am very glad I got to read it first. That is something that happens in the books, but occurs very differently in the show. The moment is still spoiled though in my opinion, since many of the same emotions are meant to be illicited.<br /><br />Honestly I wouldn't have started watching this season had I known it would have contained future book spoilers already. I wasn't planning on watching next season if TWOW wasn't out though because I knew they would start incorporateing it into that season towards the later episodes given the show's current pace.<br /><br />I sincerely regret watching the last episode, and I am not sure if I will watch the next one. It is a battle between the probability that it would get spoiled anyway (via friends or social media), which is obviously less desirable than having the TV series spoil something, and my unyielding desire to read it before I see it. Hell I had to plow through what I had remaining in The Wheel of Time and The Dark Tower series once I found out ASOIAF was being turned into a series so I could get through all the written material in time for the season 1 premiere. I only made it to ASOS in time, but I made sure I had everything read by the time season 2 started.

We don't know how accurate the information is, because we're looking in from the outside.  This is the first time something like this has really happened.  Given how you handle POV in your books, I can't imagine this information would be revealed the same way in prose, but if the information itself is accurate I would consider it very unfortunate to have learned what I did through HBO as opposed to the books, even if your execution is entirely different.<br /><br />If what is happening NEVER happens in these future books in any shape, form, or fashion, then it's really no harm done.  For example, Jon going over the Wall to deal with the renegades who have captured Bran never happened in the books, and your original story has already advanced well beyond this point.  So while it's different there is no *threat* of being spoiled, nor is there any questions of whether we *are* being spoiled.  That final scene with the Others is different though.<br /><br />A lot of this boils down to a person's tolerance for spoilers.  I love your books vehemently and have been reading them 1996.  I have a first edition hardcover inscribed by you, the letter you wrote to my eighteen-year old self tucked into the dust jacket after you kindly answered my scribbling.  I've read these books a number of times, etc.  It's my favorite story ever.  So for someone like me, your story is sacred.  HBO's series is great, but it's not canon.  I want to experience every little revelation from the source himself.<br /><br />So I'm sad to say that I'm now on high alert with every HBO episode going forward, because if something is revealed ahead of your books again I have to stop watching the series until your next book comes out.  It's not a threat or a complaint, just the honest truth. I'd rather wait for your words.  I don't even want to take the *chance* of being spoiled.  I love your story that much.<br /><br />I don't speak for all readers, because some won't care about this and others will love to know what happens next.  But there are some readers that feel as I do.  Readers like me have a very low threshold for this kind of stuff when it comes to your books.  Take it as a compliment! :)         ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","below":19060851,"ctime":"May 2 2014, 00:32:34 UTC","parent":19056755,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: no spoilers book readers?!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://douglascohen.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"douglascohen","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"douglascohen","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://douglascohen.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"douglascohen","ctime_ts":1398990754,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119660708/57295026","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368755.html?thread=19060851#t19060851","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368755.html?thread=19060851#t19060851","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368755.html?thread=19060851#t19060851","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1561894","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/pntrlqst","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19060851,"talkid":74456,"etime_ts":"1398997861","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368755.html?thread=19060851#t19060851","above":19059827,"upictitle":"Adam Minahan: pic#119660708","article":"Scarlett had three children in the book, one in the adaptation.
