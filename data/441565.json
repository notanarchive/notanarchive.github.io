{"itemid":1724,"subject":"Awards, Awards, and More Awards","event":"So, I've heard rumors that some of our Sad Puppy friends, unhappy about the way the Hugo voting turned out, are talking about starting their own awards.  Perhaps in conjunction with Dragoncon, the gigantic Atlanta media con, or perhaps at Libertycon, a smaller regional con held annually in Chattanooga.  \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth -- probably not much, since very few of the Pups seem to care what any non-Pups think -- I think this is a terrific idea.  (Which is why I suggested it back in May, when the Puppy Wars began).\r\n\r\nLook, everybody likes to get an award.  An attaboy, a tip of the hat, some recognition for their effort.  Scientists like to win Nobel Prizes, journalists like to win Pulitzers, and the guys who work at Pep Boys like to win Employee of the Month.  If you go back to the first Puppy posts, way back when, and scrape off all the stuff about SJWs and cliques and cabals, the bottom line complaint, the thing that triggered all the rage, is very simple and very human: \"hey, no one is giving US any awards.\"  The Pups and the writers and stories they liked were simply not being honored by the Hugos.  \r\n\r\nThe thing is -- and given the hundreds and thousands of words that have been written about Puppygate, it is easy to lose sight of this -- the Hugo may be the oldest and most prestigious award in our genre, but it is NOT the only one, and has not been since, hmmm, the mid 60s, at least.  That was when Damon Knight founded SFWA, and launched the Nebulas.\r\n\r\nIn an odd funhouse mirror sort of way, Damon Knight had the same issue with the Hugo Awards that the Puppies did.  He thought they were going to the wrong stories.  But Damon was coming from the other side; he wanted to make SF (not fantasy so much, he was never a fantasy fan, once said he's never read a book with a map in it) more literary.  To this end he founded Milford, founded Clarion, taught Clarion for half a century, edited ORBIT (by far the most literary of the original anthologies)... and began the Nebulas.  Damon felt that the Hugos, the fan award, too often went to popular works, whereas the Nebula would recognize more ambitious, experimental, and \"writerly\" books and stories.  (It has not always worked that way, but never mind).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/270454/270454_1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe Nebula was the first important rival to the Hugo, but it is by no means the only one.  These days, we have more awards than I can count... and many of them started with the express purpose of recognizing a genre, subgenre, group of writers, or point of view not sufficiently honored by the Hugos, according to their founders.\r\n\r\nCharles Brown started the LOCUS Award, and always insisted that it was more significant than the Hugo, since it had a larger voter base (originally just LOCUS subscribers, later expanded to include anyone who wants to send in a ballot).  For a time Charlie presented the LOCUS Awards at Dragoncon, in fact... but no one at Dragoncon seemed to give two shits (the turnout was always much bigger for the Bettie Page Lookalike Contest), so he finally moved the presentation to Westercon.\r\n\r\nLin Carter felt that epic fantasy and sword & sorcery were being ignored by the Hugo voters, and founded the Gandalf Award.  His original intent was to create an entire parallel set of awards, duplicating all the Hugo categoriesfor fantasy instead of SF.  He was talked into scaling that down into one Life Achievement Gandalf, but that was given at worldcon for a number of years, until his death.\r\n\r\nSF and fantasy and horror aficionados in the film and television industry, feeling that SF and fantasy was too often ignored by the Oscars and Emmys, started the Saturn Awards, which continue to this day.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/272673/272673_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nWiscon, the feminist-oriented convention in Madison, Wisconsin, created the Tiptree Awards to recognize outstanding works of SF and fantasy that examine issues of gender.\r\n\r\nThe World Fantasy Con has the World Fantasy Awards, sometimes called the \"Howards\" or \"Howies\" for their iconic trophy, a wonderfully grotesque bust of H.P. Lovecraft by Gahan Wilson.  Both fantasy and horror (not not SF) are eligible for that one.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/273126/273126_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/273194/273194_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/273500/273500_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThat did not prevent the Horror Writers Association from starting their own award a few years later, partly because some of them felt that the Howard did not go to horror often enough.  Their Bram Stoker Award is not, as one might think, a bust of Bram Stoker, but rather a delightful gothic ceramic statue of a haunted house.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/273771/273771_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nA small Kansas convention started the Balrog Awards, for reasons that remain unclear.  Among writers, it was also known as \"the coveted Balrog.\"  The trophy was quite imposing, especially from the rear.  (I won one once, in its last year, but the trophy was smashed in an auto accident before it could be mailed and never replaced, and the organizer went to Oman).\r\n\r\nSome of the Puppies have complained the media tie-in books never win Hugos.  That's true, they don't (and shouldn't, in my opinion).  Some of the writers of media tie-ins felt the same way, however, and instead of bitching, they created their own awards, the Scribes.  Those are still going as well.  Here, see:  http://iamtw.org/the-scribe-awards/scribe-award-nominees/\r\n\r\nThe Scribes are presented at San Diego Comicon.  So are the Inkpots, comicon's own awards, which they've been giving for decades.  Also the Eisners, THE premiere award for comics and graphic novels.  (I have never been sure why the hell the Hugos needed a Graphic Story category, when the Eisners already existed).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/273928/273928_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe Hugos are not the only award presented at worldcon either.  Libertarian fans, wanted to recognize libertarian fiction, present the Prometheus Award at worldcon annually.  (And hey, I gave my Alfies at worldcon too, though I hope they don't need to become a tradition).  There are also the Hogus and Black Holes, though admittedly those are more satire than honor.\r\n\r\nBubonicon, our own local con in New Mexico, used to give the Green Slime Awards, a brainchild of Horrible Old Roy Tackett, for the worst SF of the year.  That stopped when Roy passed.\r\n\r\nBritish fans, not content with the awards that Americans were handing out, have their own British Fantasy Awards, and also the prestigious Arthur C. Clarke Award.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/271010/271010_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/271249/271249_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/271429/271429_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/271803/271803_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe Australians, Canadians, Czechs, Spanish, and Japanese all have their own SF awards as well.  And there are doubtless many more I am not aware of.  The artists, wanting to honor more of their own than were being recognized by the Best Professional Artist Hugo, founded ASFA and began presenting Chesleys annually at worldcon.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we have the John W. Campbell Memorial Award (not to be confused with the John W. Campbell Award), the Pilgrim, the Sturgeon, the Heinlein...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/272101/272101_1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n \r\nAlso, hey, we have Reddit, and their VERY cool new Stabby Award, an engraved dagger:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/272546/272546_1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nNo doubt I have left some out.  The point being, there are a LOT of awards.  \r\n\r\nBut there is always room for more.  A great many of the awards discussed above were started precisely because the people behind them felt someone was being overlooked by the Hugos and/ or other existing awards, and wanted to give an \"attaboy\" to work they cherished.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason the Sad Puppies should not do the same.  Give them at Dragoncon, give them at Libertycon... or, hell, give them at worldcon, if you want.  Most worldcons will give you a hall for the presentation, I'm sure, just as they do for the Prometheus Awards and the Seiuns.  Or you can rent your own venue off-site, as I did with the Alfies.  Have a party. No booing, just cheers.  Give handsome trophies to those you think deserve it.  Spread joy.  \r\n\r\nThat's what awards are supposed to be about, after all.  Giving some joy back to the writers and editors and artists who have given you so much joy with their work.  Celebration.\r\n\r\nSince RAH is already taken by the Heinlein Foundation for its own award, maybe you should call them the Jims, to honor Jim Baen, an editor and publisher that I know many of you admire.  If you launch a Kickstarter to have a bust of him sculpted for the trophy, I'll be glad to contribute.  (It may surprise you to know that while Jim Baen and I were very far apart politically, we shared many a meal together, and he published a half dozen of my books.  Liberals and conservatives CAN get along, and usually did, in fandom of yore).\r\n\r\nGo for it, and maybe those puppies that you're so concerned about will finally have a reason to smile.","ditemid":441565,"eventtime":"2015-09-05 18:09:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"awards","current_moodid":30,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1441942975,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Awards, Awards, and More Awards http://goo.gl/C4bcBL","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.699614839460593]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1441498150}","revtime":1441943175},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-09-06 00:08:21","anum":221,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html","event_timestamp":1441476540,"reply_count":127,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117796605/50627511","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22565597#t22565597","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22565597#t22565597","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22565597#t22565597","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1271338","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RaUL_AMDERLAINE","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22565597,"talkid":88146,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22565597#t22565597","upictitle":"RaUL AMDERLAINE: pic#117796605","article":"Fine, we're gonna make our own award!

(I'm pretty sure John C. Wright would approve, if that matters...) I've been kind of surprised there wasn't a Chesterson already, so... opportunity knocks?<br /><br />On the opposite end of the gravitas spectrum, how about calling them the Rovers? Statue could be akin to a Mars rover. You've got exploration, science, adventure, all right there. (Maybe it's being driven by a puppy. Or maybe a puppy in a spacesuit. XD ) But, you know, be light and friendly about it instead of horrible and demonising. Awards are supposed to be congratulatory and fun, not spiteful and awful.<br /><br />Oh wait, maybe... when they aren't talking horrible politics, they're talking about adventure and fun, right? And, let's say what it is, a good helping of nostalgia.<br /><br />So atop the Rover trophy is a child, right? A kid, let's say 12. With a dog, the iconic shaggy pet dog. And they're posed together in that happy jumping around together kind of pose, the dog jumping off hind legs, looking up at the toy the kid is holding up so high, that the kid is, in their imagination, <em>flying</em>, that toy which is, of course, a <em>spaceship</em> off deep into the furthest reaches of space and adventure - maybe it's a rocket, maybe another kind of ship, it could be something like the SpaceShipOne craft, it doesn't matter as long as it's recognisably a <em>spaceship</em>, and off to adventure.<br /><br />It's got all the pieces, right? It's not \"literary,\" in that sense they're so fond to disown; it's aspirational; it's talking about imagination; it carries with it science; it's got a puppy reference if they want it; it's <em>fun</em>, if you do it right. If you make the ship look a bit like SpaceShipOne it's even referencing a <em>private</em> space effort, which is thematically concordant with their politics.<br /><br />It's not exactly modern design - it is in fact the <em>opposite</em> of modern design - but somehow I don't think that will hurt anything either.<br /><br />Seriously, if any puppies are reading this and you want to develop any of these into real awards - go to.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"September 6 2015, 04:52:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://solarbird.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"solarbird","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"solarbird","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://solarbird.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"solarbird","ctime_ts":1441515152,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/74586384/10444726","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22576093#t22576093","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22576093#t22576093","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22576093#t22576093","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22576093#t22576093","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"leslielibrarian","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://leslielibrarian.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22576093,"talkid":88187,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/441565.html?thread=22576093#t22576093","above":22570973,"upictitle":"leslielibrarian: 1984 Leslie","article":"<br />Hi Solarbird:<br /><br />While I can easily imagine/visualize the award statue you describe, one would need a real wizard of a craftsperson to put it together.

While I am not a puppy myself (writing critically of this year's efforts at the superversivesf site) I have contact with people on the pro-puppy side and it sounds like a new award might emerge.  I had recommended that idea (privately) and was told it was already being considered. It sounded serious.<br /><br />I think that an award and the recommended reading list (if it does not include rankings) would be practical, useful, and--more importantly--fun ways to deal with many issues said to be behind their problems with the Hugos.<br /><br />Unfortunately the solution may not be as simple as this, though I hope it can be. There seems to be a heartfelt concern about an ongoing culture war, which I am not certain how to deflate.  At least not in a way that removes their concern over how other awards, and certain people behind them, (are perceived to) operate. Because from that vantage point it is more than just \"about an award\". <br /><br />This is something that I hope can be resolved in time through working and talking together, or at least the energy and animosity put into \"fighting it\" it diminished. There is a level of anger (to be fair on both sides, though not from you) that I have a hard time empathizing with, and about zero interest in extending.
