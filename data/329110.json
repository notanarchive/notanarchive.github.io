I spend a good portion of my days thinking about ASoIaF. Once, I recall, when recommending your series to a friend, I mentioned that I had spent the last four hours online reading about a possible conspiracy theory relating to the actions of some of the characters, as evidence of how absorbing the books can be. The books are so incredibly detailed that I often find myself getting lost in them. And like many others, I spend the rest of my time patiently waiting for The Winds of Winter.<br /><br />Anyway, regarding Indira's casting, didn't you recently say that the Martells (Dornish) were, essentially, white (Mediterranean)? Indira, as half Indian and half Swiss (I think?) is going to be perceived as a person of colour on Game of Thrones, unlike Pascal who some have said may be white-passing. I know that Ellaria is only half Dornish, but many have long suspected that the Dornish may have some Middle Eastern or South Asian equivalents in the real world (I think you once also mentioned that Janina Gavankar matched your view of Lady Nymeria (half Salty Dornish, half-Volantene)).<br /><br />I realize that you have, to some extent, already discussed this, but in light of Indira's casting and your comment about Gavankar (which I recently heard about since this whole Oberyn Martell debate began), I was hoping you would consider the matter once more. And again, thank you for making this series.
