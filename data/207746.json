Can they clothe like men? What about bastard? Can they (women) be merchant, singers or warriors...? And so on...More generally, in term of clothing and arts, i have always thought that  Dorne is more like the Italy in the beginning of the Renaissance (with a touch of Orient), than MÃ©dieval Europa ?
