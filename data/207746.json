So thanks a lot for all the pleasure you give to me and to a (uncreasing, i'm a proselyt ^^)number of my friends.

Can they clothe like men? What about bastard? Can they (women) be merchant, singers or warriors...? And so on...More generally, in term of clothing and arts, i have always thought that  Dorne is more like the Italy in the beginning of the Renaissance (with a touch of Orient), than Médieval Europa ?
