{"itemid":1831,"subject":"All Hail the Champions","event":"Thrity-two teams started the season, became twelve, became eight, became four.  After Sunday we are down to two.  Congratulations to the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers, who will meet in two weeks in Super Bowl L.\r\n\r\nI watched the championship games, of course.  Not much to say about them.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon game was a blowout.  Must have been very painful for Cardinals fans, and a romp in the park for Carolina fans.  Though I did wonder at halftime when the Panthers were only up by 17 points; the preceding week they'd enjoyed a 31-0 lead over Seattle, yet barely hung on to win.  But this week Carolina decided to show up for the second half as well.  I really thought Arizona would give them more of a fight.  Carson Palmer looked dreadful.\r\n\r\nThe morning game was exciting.  Too exciting for my taste; until that two-point pass fell incomplete, I really feared that Brady and the Pats would pull it out. Denver's pass rush was amazing.  I have never seen Brady smacked around so much, even in the two Super Bowls where the G-Men beat him.  Evil Little Bill made a blunder by not kicking that field goal late in the fourth when he had the chance; in hindsight, that would have been the difference.\r\n\r\nIt is always great to see the Patriots lose.  And I take some solace knowing that it was losing that game to the Jets that put the championship in Denver rather than New England.  It would be have been an entirely different game in Foxboro.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the Pats are going home, and the Broncos are going on.  It would be wonderful if Eli's Big Brother could end his career with another ring... but I fear that is not likely to happen.  The Panthers just look too tough.\r\n\r\nWe'll see.  That's why they play the games.","ditemid":468756,"eventtime":"2016-01-25 21:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"good","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Jan 26 04:59:06 2016]R [Tue Jan 26 04:59:08 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/691847816591884289 ","current_moodid":126,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1478580182,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/691847816591884289","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.711608796477047]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1453784374}","revtime":1454918046},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-26 04:59:00","anum":20,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html","event_timestamp":1453759140,"reply_count":50,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123057959/69751082","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23917844#t23917844","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23917844#t23917844","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23917844#t23917844","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2507276","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/steve.huntsinger","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23917844,"talkid":93429,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23917844#t23917844","upictitle":"Steven James: pic#123057959","article":"Broncos pass rush will make Cam make mistakes.

I'd say the Vikings are better suited for the Starks (in the frigid north; never win anything even though they're a respectable franchise), but you nailed the Lannisters. The bad guys who everyone hates, but who always win! Tom Brady is a perfect Jaime Lannister. Belicheck is an even more perfect Tywin. A ruthless pragmatist who cares about the success of the Patriots above all else, including the careers of his individual players. Gronk is Tyrion (Danny Woodhead would've been better. Too bad he's long gone). Can't think of who Cersei would be. Gisele? Brandon LaFell? Josh McDaniels? Josh McDaniels seems to fit the bill. He was a diva when he was the head coach of the Broncos, and he and Brady could certainly be having a love affair. Oh, boy. Who'd Brady push out the tower window? <br /><br />I'm thinking Cowboys for the Targaryens. The dynasty of yesterday struggling to get back to power. Jerry Jones is the Mad King, of course. Not only does he seem a little senile (\"Greg Hardy is a team leader\"), but he is responsible for the ending of his franchise's dynasty, like Aerys II. Tom Landry was Jaehaerys I. Had a LONG coaching dynasty, and by all accounts wise and benevolent. Romo is Daenerys. Naive and mistake-prone, and feels very entitled to the throne (has made a Namathesque Super Bowl guarantee twice in just the past year). He is but a young basketball player and knows little of the ways of football. <br /><br />The Night's Watch - I can't decide between the Browns and the Packers. On the one hand, Cleveland is where talent goes to die. On the other hand, Green Bay is even more frigid than Minneapolis. You've heard of the Ice Bowl. The windchill was MINUS FORTY-EIGHT! They played football in that weather. Sheesh. I can't see Aaron Rodgers, or anyone on the Packers or Browns roster, as Jon Snow, unfortunately. Rodgers could be Pyp or Dolorous Edd. He's a humorous fellow. He's also a Game of Thrones fan, if you didn't know. Got some flack on twitter when he spoiled the Red Wedding. <br /><br />Others - Raiders as Greyjoys, mayhaps. Tyrells as the Colts? Longstanding Southern power and all that, plus I hate the Colts like I hate the Tyrells. The Steelers could potentially be the Baratheons. The Rams are the Faceless Men. Not relevant to the competition themselves, but they can come out of nowhere and fell the mighty. Ask anyone in the NFC West if you don't believe me.<br /><br />As for non-Westeros football thoughts - I'm glad you're pulling for Peyton in the Super Bowl. I thought it would have been awfully tragic if his career had just faded to black like it seemed it was going to this season. He deserves to go out in a blaze of glory like Elway before him. <br /> ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 27 2016, 05:03:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://koultpython.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"koultpython","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"koultpython","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://koultpython.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"koultpython","ctime_ts":1453870987,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23929108#t23929108","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23929108#t23929108","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23929108#t23929108","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23929108,"talkid":93473,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468756.html?thread=23929108#t23929108","above":23927828,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Two 4th down conversions to get the TD had me sweating like an Ibbenese whore in the Dornish heat.  The wave of relief that swept over me when that 2pt pass was picked and then the defender went down is just indescribable.  <br /><br />I am of the same mind as you regarding Peyton.  Would LOVE to see him go out a champion, but Super Cam and the Panthers just look so unstoppable right now that I just don't see it happening.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 27 2016, 22:37:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Too Close","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/dan.mackreedeez","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Dan Mcreedeez","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2480238","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69406670&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Dan Mcreedeez","ctime_ts":1453934252,"tracked":0}]}
