{"itemid":2068,"subject":"Lovecraft in the Land of Enchantment","event":"We had a great time last week when H.P. Lovecraft returned from the grave to visit us here in the Land of <s>Yig</s> Enchantment.\r\n\r\nIf you missed it -- shame on you -- well, it turns out that HPL recorded a couple of segments of his \"Ask Lovecraft\" YouTube series while he was here in town.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"902\"/>\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"903\"/>\r\n\r\nSeeing HPL at Meow Wolf was especially fun, since there are a couple of... ahem... decidedly Lovecraftian touches to be found in the House of Eternal Return.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get a chance to see Leeman Kessler perform as HPL, do catch him.   It's the next best thing to a shuggoth on your doorstep.","ditemid":529430,"eventtime":"2017-03-21 00:47:00","props":{"current_mood":"giggly","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"comedy, santa fe. meow wolf, horror","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Mar 28 06:47:43 2017]R [Tue Mar 28 06:47:44 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/846614767431274496 ","current_moodid":72,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1490760388,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/846614767431274496","picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.631141636080232]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1490683670}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2068?v=1490910321","revtime":1490910321},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-03-28 06:47:43","anum":22,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html","event_timestamp":1490057220,"reply_count":5,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125878916/77259760","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25908502#t25908502","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25908502#t25908502","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25908502#t25908502","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"writing_mombie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25908502,"talkid":101205,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25908502#t25908502","article":"This is great, thank you for sharing!","upictitle":"Writing_Mombie: turtle","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"1 month ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"March 28 2017, 06:54:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I love it :D","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"writing_mombie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"writing_mombie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"writing_mombie","ctime_ts":1490684082,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/83642019/4058536","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25909014#t25909014","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25909014#t25909014","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25909014#t25909014","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"alfrecht","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://alfrecht.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25909014,"talkid":101207,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529430.html?thread=25909014#t25909014","upictitle":"Prof. Jeremy M.

I represent those forces and sentiments which lead to the subjugation and collapse of classical civilization under the fetters of Christian superstition, a herald of the long darkness of the Middle Ages and its centuries long decay into mawkish illusions of meekness and devotion. I am forever expelled from the ranks of the proud warriors and philosophers of the ancient world, or the bold and independent men of the Western Aryan type, who were assuredly all cat lovers.<br /><br />All of this is a long way of saying, next time you see Lovecraft, tell him 'same to you, buddy.'<br /><br />On the plus side, I learned some new words!
