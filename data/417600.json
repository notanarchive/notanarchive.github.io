{"itemid":1631,"subject":"Tone","event":"I used the Greyjoy icon on this one for a reason.\r\n\r\nWe reap what we sow.\r\n\r\nI will be returning to the key issues involving the Hugo Awards and the Sad Puppy slate soon.  Maybe later tonight.  Maybe tomorrow.  But first a small aside.  I want to talk about tone.\r\n\r\nThere's a thing out there on the internet called \"the Tone Argument.\"  Supposedly this is a bad, bad thing to do.  In online discussions, one must never use the Tone Argument.\r\n\r\nThe way I have seen it work, dozens of times now, is that a debate or discussion starts out as a reasonable exchange of ideas, but then grows heated.  Tempers fray, names are called, the posts get uglier and angrier... and someone, or maybe a bunch of someones, steps over the line and says something truly cruel or hurtful or just nasty.  And the target, or maybe a bystander, objects and says, \"no call for language like that\" or \"can't we all calm down\" or something along that line... whereupon a loud cry of \"Tone Argument, Tone Argument, Tone Argument\" goes up, and person who called for calm is shouted down or torn apart.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the trope seems to be that if you're on my side, you can say anything you like, no matter how vicious or unkind or inflammatory, and I will defend not only your argument but your \"right\" to be as nasty as you want.  If you're on the other side, of course, well, that's a whole different story.  Then you might get silenced or moderated or banned.\r\n\r\nThere's also a lot of rhetoric about kicking down and punching up and the like.\r\n\r\nI say it's spinach, and I say the hell with it.\r\n\r\nI am against punching and kicking.  Up, down, or sideways.  No punching here, please.  \r\n\r\nI applaud the Tone Argument.  The Tone Argument is valid.  Yay for the Tone Argument.\r\n\r\nWe can disagree with each other without attacking each other.  And no, I am not going to listen to you if you're screaming at me and calling me offensive names.  You shouldn't either, no matter who you are.  None of us should have to put up with that shit. \r\n\r\nIt really pisses me off, reading some of the threads and comments on both sides of Puppygate, that every time someone calls for a more reasoned discourse and an end to all the name-calling, we hear a chorus of, \"they started it\" and \"no, THEY started it\" and \"they called me X so I will call them Y\" and \"don't you dare silence me, I will say anything I like, I'm the one who speaks truth to power.\"  I don't care who started it.  I just want it to stop.\r\n\r\nAnd it will.  On my Not A Blog, at least.\r\n\r\nWe reap what we sow.  Enough.","ditemid":417600,"eventtime":"2015-04-08 20:23:00","props":{"current_mood":"determined","current_location":"Santa Fe... for now","taglist":"internet, hugo awards","current_moodid":45,"commentalter":1428898349,"crosspost_tw":" Tone http://j.mp/1anF5A3","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"greyjoy","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.633073923979731]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428546187}","revtime":1428810316},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-09 02:23:04","anum":64,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html","event_timestamp":1428524580,"reply_count":94,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116045056/46587627","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20601664#t20601664","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20601664#t20601664","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20601664#t20601664","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1056126","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/k3lit0","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20601664,"talkid":80475,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20601664#t20601664","upictitle":"Kells O&#39;Connor: pic#116045056","article":"As Wil Wheaton says, \"Don't be a dick.\"  Rule 1 of life.  <br /><br />Good for you, upholding it and trying to have a nice discussion without too much meanmode.

They spread it on social media of various sorts. It goes viral among that segment of society and they demand action. While there are voices that seem quite sane and capable of examining each side on its merits to decide where they stand, they end up being largely drowned out by the shrill and fanatical, for whom the other side is not merely mistaken but EVIL. Before long, you have doxxing (perfectly justified, since the other side is EVIL, remember), you have widespread accusations of racism, misogyny, misandry, fascism, communism, homophobia, transphobia, religious bashing...really, insert whatever fits the scenario and the political inclination. <br /><br />Above all, there is absolutely zero chance for any positive change through dialogue, because the dialogue primarily consists of demonizing and insults, with everyone determined to prove they're 100% right and other party 100% wrong. Whatever remnants of sanity are there are usually long gone by the end, as it's obviously a complete waste. <br /><br />Note: the group that starts it can be right-wing or left-wing. It doesn't matter. Before long, the representatives of the other side are likely to be acting much the same. <br /><br />Suffice to say, a familiar pattern long before 'Puppygate.'

It's just the way the award works, and it's the way it worked when Harry Potter took it from A Storm of Swords.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 9 2015, 06:14:04 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/lordevaco","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lordevaco","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2934744","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73672646&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"lordevaco","ctime_ts":1428560044,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20648256#t20648256","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20648256#t20648256","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20648256#t20648256","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20648256,"talkid":80657,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417600.html?thread=20648256#t20648256","above":20633664,"upictitle":"George R.R.

The Jo Walton novel had a lot of admirers, Jo is a gifted and eloquent wordsmith, and the protagonist of her book was, to all intents, an SF fan much like the voters, a character that many of them strongly identified with.  It was no surprise that she won.  <br /><br />(Also, for what it's worth, DANCE was not exactly edged out there.  It finished last.  Clearly some worldcon voters had problems with the book.  But hey, it was an honor just to be nominated, and TIME magazine named DANCE the best book of the year.  Not the best SF or fantasy, the best novel.  I take solace in that, even though it did not come with a rocket).<br /><br />You win some, you lose some.
