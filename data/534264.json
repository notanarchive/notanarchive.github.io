{"itemid":2086,"subject":"Vanishing Magicians","event":"Francis Menotti was at the Jean Cocteau over the weekend, and amazed us all.   This is the third time we've had Francis at the JCC, and he always does a great show.  He performed the trick that stumped Penn & Teller, of course, along with a lot of other tricks that stumped the rest of us, including me.   Always a fun time when Menotti is in time.\r\n\r\nAlas, alack, a couple of the other magic acts that we've been looking forward to -- the ones I blogged about here http://grrm.livejournal.com/528565.html -- have vanished from our schedule, at least temporarily.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing Misty Lee, one of our faves, was scheduled to return on June 9-10, but she's run into a scheduling conflict with a television appearance, so we're having to push her visit back until September.   And the Naked Magicians, scheduled for May 30, are gone as well.   We lost our venue and partner for that one, and the Aussies are too big for our tiny JCC stage and auditorium.  We still want to bring them to Santa Fe, but right now we cannot say when and where.  Watch this space.\r\n\r\nSo... there's a bit less magic on our schedule, for the none, but we still have some amzing special events coming up at the JCC.   TERRY BROOKS will be here for an author event on June 17, and RICHARD KADREY on July 13.  July 7 - 9 we have the GAME OF THRONES season 6 marathon.\r\n\r\nBut much soon, do not forget, Max Headroom will be coming for our M-M-M-MAXATHON!  That's May 13 - 20, with Michael Cassutt, Steve Roberts, and Matt Frewer... and my own, never before seen or heard, Max Headroom episodes.  Don't miss it.","ditemid":534264,"eventtime":"2017-04-24 15:14:00","props":{"current_mood":"moody","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, television","current_moodid":23,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1493213882,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.656548800982594]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1493068481}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2086?v=1493228612","revtime":1493228610},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-04-24 21:14:35","anum":248,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html","event_timestamp":1493046840,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26036728#t26036728","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26036728#t26036728","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26036728#t26036728","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_4104276","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/106270994374688529511","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26036728,"talkid":101705,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26036728#t26036728","upictitle":"Sadullah Goncu: pic#0","article":"Did you watched season 6 of GoT ? or are you staying away from it untill TWOW is complete ? <br /><br />By the way , I really enjoy the youtube channel of jean cocteau cinema.It is a great way for watching this events specially for your overseas fans like me .<br /><br />Best of Wishes from the Ancient Lands of Anatolia","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 weeks ago","ctime":"April 24 2017, 21:46:56 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/106270994374688529511","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Sadullah Goncu","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4104276","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81801748&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Sadullah Goncu","ctime_ts":1493070416,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124302622/73354478","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26037240#t26037240","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26037240#t26037240","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26037240#t26037240","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2902334","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26037240,"talkid":101707,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26037240#t26037240","upictitle":"The Dragon Demands: pic#124302622","article":"Bad news, your Grace:  turns out Wonder Man was going to be in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 played by Nathan Fillion, but they deleted all his scenes at the last minute.

BETTER CALL SAUL is, for me, calling attention to another distinction: writers who forget characters and writers who remember them.<br /><br />That is to say, there are writers who put a character in their story or show or whatever, the character does what they're supposed to do to advance the plot, and then the character vanishes, never to be seen or even mentioned again. And then there are writers who remember even the smallest of characters and look for opportunities to have those characters show up whenever they can. <br /><br />Pretty obvious by this point that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould fall in the latter category.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 weeks ago","ctime":"April 26 2017, 03:34:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sdschaffer.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sdschaffer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sdschaffer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sdschaffer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sdschaffer","ctime_ts":1493177671,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/127539564/81814306","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26040824#t26040824","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26040824#t26040824","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26040824#t26040824","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_4105637","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10106442451322808/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26040824,"talkid":101721,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534264.html?thread=26040824#t26040824","upictitle":"Brandon Karlsgodt: pic#127539564","article":"My sister, wife, and brother-in-law visited Santa Fe last weekend.
