It was excellent! I think it's awesome that you allow video games to be made based off the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. There's a lot of potential to be found in that field and I'm excited to see what the future holds in that regard. Video games have been pretty lackluster lately and it's nice to sit back and actually find yourself immersed with it these days. I know for a fact, if there were more games from ASoIaF I would be playing them quite frequently. An open world role playing game would be incredibly fun if it were designed correctly by a talented studio. Too many games are alike these days and that worries me that somebody might receive the power to create a game for your fans and then completely screw up on it. <br /><br />Anyways... Hope you're well and that you're enjoying the new year! Just bought The Hound's Helm from Valyrian Steel the other day and it doesn't leave my side. You rock, George!

Stories. <br /><br />This is a game. Not fiction.\"<br /><br />I disagree. As hinted at by their name, Telltale specializes in telling stories. Video games CAN be just games, but the medium has come a long way from the days when the story was always just a thin excuse for gameplay, and in the case of Telltale the game elements are drastically minimized next to the narrative elements. It's more like an episode of GoT that every once in awhile lets you decide what to say or how to act than anything else.<br /><br />That said, I don't see any contradiction in your stance on this. The game is officially licensed, based on the TV show rather than the books and was made with the help of someone you trust to get it right. To the extent that it portrays canon characters like Tyrion or Margaery, they've been portrayed faithfully, and in any case the majority of the story is centered on non-canon characters who have little to no effect on the story you're telling. There's a lot of things that separate this from simple fan fiction.
