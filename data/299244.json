He had a 74-yard burst that proved his speed is back, and he's still one of the toughest short-yardage runners in the game, scoring from 1 and 4 yards in the 30-20 loss at Seattle.<br /><br />Seriously, how do you snub either Peterson or Peyton Manning in the Comeback Player of the Year vote? They both deserve a trophy.\"<br /><br />Two Seattle wins. Two \"quick snaps\" that don't mention any players from Seattle, but talk about Name Brand players on the losing team, or the one bright point the losing team had.<br /><br />If Don Banks (based out of Chicago, and formerly based out of Madison WI) were writing for the New York Post, I could see that kind of reporting on the jets game.
