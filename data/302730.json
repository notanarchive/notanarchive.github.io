{"itemid":1182,"subject":"More on the App","event":"Since announcing the official Ice & Fire App (see below), we've gotten a lot of questions, most of them concerning when and if the app will be made available for Android, and when and if it will be offering for sale in countries other than the US and UK.\r\n\r\nI ran these questions past my people at Random House.\r\n\r\nThere are, alas, no plans at present to produce the app for Android.  That is Random House's call, not mine.  (I seldom use a cellphone myself, and don't know one from the other, so all such calls are made by folks more conversant with the issues involved).  It is possible that may change in the future if there is sufficient demand, but please email Random House, not me.  If an Android app is made available, you can get the update on www.suvudu.com\" \r\n\r\nAs for availability in other countries, Barnes and Noble only sells apps in the US and UK, so the Nook version is only available in the US and UK.  \r\n\r\nBelow is a list of the countries where the app is available for iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch). \r\n\r\n. United States\r\n. Canada\r\n. United Kingdom\r\n. Australia\r\n. Austria\r\n. Belgium\r\n. Bulgaria\r\n. Cyprus\r\n. Czech Republic\r\n. Denmark\r\n. Estonia\r\n. Finland\r\n. France\r\n. Germany\r\n. Greece\r\n. Hungary\r\n. Ireland\r\n. Italy\r\n. Japan\r\n. Latvia\r\n. Lithuania\r\n. Luxembourg\r\n. Malta\r\n. Netherlands\r\n. Poland\r\n. Portugal\r\n. Romania\r\n. Slovakia\r\n. Slovenia\r\n. Spain\r\n. Sweden\r\n. Switzerland\r\n\r\nThe Random House subrights team is currently looking into translation deals for non-English-speaking readers.  But there is nothing to announce yet on the translation front.
