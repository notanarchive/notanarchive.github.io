In between each season film shorts that show significant events in the characters' lives!  The perfect example I can think of would be a 15 minute short showing Davos smuggling Onions.  A little stagecraft shows we're working with events prior to Game of Thrones and the subsequent books, and we see *why* Davos is so important to Stannis and we get the \"Onion Knight\" reference without needing much else shown.  As a person who re-reads your novels every summer (I'm a high school teacher so my reading during the year is confined to teaching materials) I love dissecting your minor characters.<br /><br />Think of the potential for mini-sodes on Robert's rebellion! I know there's a lot of money and planning and that this might be a pipe dream, but I think it'd be a great way to handle the minor-characters-turn-major problem!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"April 2 2011, 00:14:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"An idea","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://shamrockjew.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"shamrockjew","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"shamrockjew","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://shamrockjew.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"shamrockjew","ctime_ts":1301703248,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12819280#t12819280","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12819280#t12819280","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12819280#t12819280","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"attilathepbnun","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://attilathepbnun.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12819280,"talkid":50075,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12819280#t12819280","upictitle":"attilathepbnun: pic#0","article":"Of course we won't underestimate your sinister powers!*bows*","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"April 2 2011, 00:28:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://attilathepbnun.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"attilathepbnun","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"attilathepbnun","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://attilathepbnun.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"attilathepbnun","ctime_ts":1301704132,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12821072#t12821072","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12821072#t12821072","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12821072#t12821072","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tstanton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tstanton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12821072,"talkid":50082,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/206672.html?thread=12821072#t12821072","upictitle":"tstanton: pic#0","article":"Over the last ten or so years, the same thing happened to me....four jobs that I had left ended up going out of business within a short period of time...usually no more than a year later.<br /><br />On the one hand, that's really nice payback, since I didn't much care for them.
