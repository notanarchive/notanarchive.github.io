I adore you. I have everything you've put out except The Armageddon Rag, and I'm sure I could order it but I love bookstores so much and none of them seem to carry it. I worship you as a creator, a linguist, a novelist, and just a fan in general.<br /><br />I don't want your autograph. What would it mean to me? That I got to be one of 10s of thousands of people? That I've contributed a fraction of a percentage to your eventual arthritis?<br /><br />I don't understand why anyone would want your autograph. I guess in your day it made sense; with shorter lines and more time to spend with your author, an autograph MEANT something. It was a memory, of something significant. Not so today. Now it's a memory of standing for hours while you cramp your hand into oblivion. I'm sure you do your best to remember every face, every comment, every smiling face. But c'mon, man. Unless you're superhuman, my guess is that it's become more of a tria than much else. I know you love and respect your fans with all your heart; that you wish you had hundreds if you to meet their every need. It's easy to see that in you. You spent half your life as one of us; a fan.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. If I had a genie and a wish I'd want to have a beer with you; talk fantasy, a little about your works, a LOT about me (let's not kid ourselves that's all we all want to talk about).<br />But a signature that proves little other that I wasted 6 hours so you could get carpal tunnel...<br /><br />I just don't get it.<br /><br />I love you; you're a saint and an all time favorite of mine,<br />But I promise I won't contribute to the fanfare that has become your life. It's a blessing and a curse. <br /><br />Blessing: look what you've done with the Cocteau and Wolf Sanctuary. Look what you've donee or your genre! <br /><br />Curse: watch the clock ticking away and fans trying to browbeat a novel out of you; a novel whose core came suddenly to you and whose world wrote itself more than you did. <br /><br />How much time do you get each year to let this world sweep you up onto its back and take you places you never knew you'd be (not to even mention the readers). Do you even still get that chance? I truly hope you do, and I respect the hell out of your \"true art has no deadline\" credo. <br />I hope that you still get enjoy it for the majority of the time!<br /> I get the feeling that you do, and love you all the more for it. Worldwide fame and relmown has it's price.<br /><br />Thank you, George. I look forward to whatever comes next, be it an interview, a blog post, a novella, an \"editing credit,\" or (dare I say?)
