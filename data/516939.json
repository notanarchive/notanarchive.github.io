{"itemid":2019,"subject":"Hugo Time","event":"It's that time again.  Another year has ended, another worldcon is on the horizon (The Finnish Convention, this August, in Helsinki), and nominations are once again open for the Hugo Awards for the best science fiction and fantasy of 2016.\r\n\r\nTo nominate, you need to be a member of at least one of these three worldcons:\r\n     -- MidAmericon II, last year's Kansas City worldcon,\r\n     -- the current year's worldcon, in Helsinki,\r\n     -- the 2018 worldcon, ConJose II, in San Jose, California.\r\n\r\nUnless you've got a time machine, it's too late to join MidAmericon II, but signing up for Helsinki and San Jose is easy enough... and the sooner you do it, the less you'll be spending, since the cost of membership rises as we get nearer to the con.  You do NOT have to attend to be able to nominate.  Supporting Memberships are also available, at a much lower rate.\r\n\r\nTo join the Helsinki con, go to:\r\nhttp://www.worldcon.fi/\r\n\r\nTo join for San Jose, the address is:\r\nhttp://www.worldcon76.org/\r\n\r\nJoin one, join the other, join both.  Come if you can, but nominate even if you can't.\r\n\r\nOnce you've signed up, you will be sent your own personalized link to the nominations page, which will allow you to nominate the books, stories, movies, television shows, artists, fans, and editors whose work most wowed you this past year.\r\n\r\nThe Hugo Awards were first given in 1953, and remain our field's most prestigious, important, and meaningful awards.  The list of Hugo winners is a Who's Who in science fiction and fantasy, and you can have a voice in determining which names are added to that distinguished roster besides those of Alfred Bester, Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Roger Zelazny, Ursula K. Le Guin, Jack Vance, Connie Willis, Samuel R. Delany, N.K. Jemisin, James Tiptree Jr, Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Gardner Dozois, Lois McMaster Bujold, Orson Scott Card, Poul Anderson, Frank Herbert, Anne Leckie, Anne McCaffery, and so many many more.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, come to worldcon if you can.  The best place to meet and hang with your favorite writers.  Including me...","ditemid":516939,"eventtime":"2017-01-17 15:55:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, awards","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Jan 20 22:55:30 2017]R [Fri Jan 20 22:55:31 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/822578328678924289 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1485296868,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/822578328678924289","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.612096785228557]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1484952959}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2019?v=1485651159","revtime":1485651154},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-20 22:55:29","anum":75,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html","event_timestamp":1484668500,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125436642/76369012","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25641547#t25641547","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25641547#t25641547","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25641547#t25641547","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cyniclclasicist","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cyniclclasicist.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25641547,"talkid":100162,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25641547#t25641547","upictitle":"cyniclclasicist: pic#125436642","article":"Lets not let Trump/Euron spoil the year.

And we've got lots of information about how to buy, borrow, or read the stories for free online. (Sometimes people hear about a story they'd like to read, but cannot find any way to get hold of it.)<br /><br />Besides short fiction, there's a really nice photo gallery for choosing Best Pro Artist, there's a list of Campbell-eligible authors and the short stories they wrote this year, plus tips on making nominations in other areas. (Best Editor, Short Form, is coming next week.)<br /><br />Like last year, it's all free. No fees, no ads, no affiliate codes on the links, and no begging for money.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"January 21 2017, 02:57:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Short Fiction Nomination Assistance","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/104047528081360678099","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gregory Hullender","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3235758","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76533502&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Gregory Hullender","ctime_ts":1484967473,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25644619#t25644619","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25644619#t25644619","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25644619#t25644619","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25644619,"talkid":100174,"etime_ts":"1484980084","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25644619#t25644619","above":25643851,"upictitle":"George R.R.

When I look for John Picacio, I look under P, not J.  Also, your list omits two of the artists I will be nominating myself -- Michael Komarck, who does our fantastic Wild Cards covers, and Didier Graffet, who painted the 2017 ICE & FIRE calendar, which debuted in July 2016.  Do you have some selection criteria with which I am unfamiliar?  <br /><br />In the Drama categories, you list only films in Long Form, as if only they were eligible.  But in fact television programs can also compete in Long Form, if the fans nominate the entire season instead of an individual episode.  In fact it was in Long Form that GAME OF THRONES won its first Hugo, at Chicago, for season one as a whole.  This year, I think one could make a strong case for nominating GOT season six as a whole, along with the first seasons of WESTWORLD and STRANGER THINGS.  All three had a dramatic unity that makes them, really, a single story rather than a string of episodes.<br /><br />Whether or not the fans chose to nominate whole seasons of these shows in Long Form, rather than episodes in Short Form, is of course entirely up to them, but they should be reminded that they do have that option.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"January 21 2017, 04:57:19 UTC","parent":25643851,"massactions":0,"subject":"RE: Short Fiction Nomination Assistance","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"January 21 2017, 06:28:04 UTC","dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1484974639,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/127019213/80650747","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25651019#t25651019","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25651019#t25651019","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25651019#t25651019","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sebifeix","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sebifeix.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25651019,"talkid":100199,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25651019#t25651019","above":25644619,"upictitle":"sebifeix: pic#127019213","article":"One didn't even know that one could nominate different forms, one must correct this at once ;)<br />Thanks for the clarification and your efforts.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"January 23 2017, 14:58:26 UTC","parent":25644619,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Short Fiction Nomination Assistance","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sebifeix.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sebifeix","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sebifeix","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sebifeix.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sebifeix","ctime_ts":1485183506,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/127013152/80602365","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25645131#t25645131","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25645131#t25645131","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25645131#t25645131","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3982117","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1335953056425647/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25645131,"talkid":100176,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516939.html?thread=25645131#t25645131","upictitle":"Aaron Hdez: pic#127013152","article":"I imagine you won't be nominated for this year either?
