{"itemid":1125,"subject":"Land o' the Flea, Home o' the Plague","event":"So... I have already posted my schedule for the worldcon in Chicago (see below), but I neglected to mention that the next con on my schedule is actually our hometown convention, Bubonicon, down the road in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  (Land o' the Flea and Home o' the Plague, as con mascot Perry Rodent will be glad to tell you).\r\n\r\nI will be at that one too.  My schedule:\r\n\r\nFRIDAY AUG 24\r\n\r\n8:30 pm   -  READING  (I will probably read from THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE)   Acoma\r\n10:30 pm  -  CHARITY AUCTION (will be donating various signed books and collectibles)\r\n\r\nSATURDAY AUG 25\r\n\r\n1:00 pm   -  HOLLYWOOD TALES panel w/ SNodgrass & Cassutt           Salon E\r\n5:30 pm   -  MASS SIGNING (all the writers at the con, defacing books)\r\n\r\nSUNDAY  AUG 26\r\n\r\n12:15 noon  -  SIGNING (me and Brandon Sanderson, defacing books)\r\n\r\nOf course, I will be hanging around the bar and cruising the parties as well.\r\n\r\nSame rules as worldcon:  always glad to meet you and converse, but I will sign stuff only at the designated signings on Saturday and Sunday.  Thanks for understanding.\r\n\r\nBubonicon only draws about a tenth as many people as worldcon, so if you're in driving distance of Albuquerque, there's no better place to hang with your favorite writers and fellow fen.  A link with all the necessary info can be found on my Appearances page.\r\n\r\nSee you there.","ditemid":288004,"eventtime":"2012-08-14 11:57:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"convention, signed books","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1345180031,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1346110012},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-08-14 17:57:02","anum":4,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288004.html","event_timestamp":1344945420,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124483323/36582828","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288004.html?thread=16462596#t16462596","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288004.html?thread=16462596#t16462596","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288004.html?thread=16462596#t16462596","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"insurrbution","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16462596,"talkid":64307,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288004.html?thread=16462596#t16462596","upictitle":"insurrbution: pic#124483323","article":"You AND Brandon Sanderson on the 26th?!
