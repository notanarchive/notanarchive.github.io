{"itemid":465,"subject":"Home Again","event":"I got home a little past midnight on Sunday night, after a long and gruelling trip from Casablanca.  Three flights, changes in NYC/ JFK and Minneapolis/St. Paul, close to twenty-four hours in transit since the wake-up call came through in my Casablance hotel.  I was pretty much a zombie by the time I stumbled off the last flight into Parris's loving arms, and a rotting zombie at that.  After being oh-so-careful in Morocco -- not drinking the water, brushing the teeth with bottle water, avoiding uncooked food, etc -- I made the grievous error of eating at the McDonald's in the Minneapolis airport during our layover there, and came down with an nice all-American case of food poisoning.  By the time I boarded my last flight my stomach felt as if I'd swallowed a lead bowling ball.  It was the first time I'd eaten at a Mickey D's in a decade, and I hope that it's the last.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, the last day and a half I've spent mostly in bed or in the john, but I'm feeling a little better now.  This is the first time I've felt strong enough to boot up my computer... where, of course, I found five hundred emails waiting.\r\n\r\nThe trip was great, and I hope to write more about it later, when I'm feeling stronger.\r\n\r\nI have to say, though, I am not sure how many of these overseas trips are left in me.  It's great when I get there, but air travel has just become SO exhausting and SO uncomfortable, especially when oceans are involved, that the mere thought of any more just now is daunting.\r\nWhere are the rocket planes that I was promised in the SF of my youth?","ditemid":119048,"eventtime":"2009-11-24 14:31:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":303,"taglist":"everyday life","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":82,"commentalter":1296105744,"interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"2:4,18:19,8:4,33:7,11:7,37:4,1:4,32:9,3:28,5:9,20:23,9:21,22:7,13:4,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-11-24 21:31:22","anum":8,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html","event_timestamp":1259073060,"reply_count":43,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/102694235/537418","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?replyto=8007176","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007176#t8007176","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007176#t8007176","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007176#t8007176","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"faerierhona","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://faerierhona.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8007176,"talkid":31278,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007176#t8007176","upictitle":"Sidhe who must be obeyed: pink purple dreads","article":"Thank you so much for coming to London, it was lovely to meet you1","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"November 24 2009, 21:37:16 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://faerierhona.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"faerierhona","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"faerierhona","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://faerierhona.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"faerierhona","ctime_ts":1259098636,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/66551920/3266187","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?replyto=8007432","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007432#t8007432","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007432#t8007432","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007432#t8007432","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"smofbabe","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8007432,"talkid":31279,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8007432#t8007432","upictitle":"Smofbabe: wellcard","article":"Sorry you got so sick, but better home than in a Morocco hotel!

Though my 'problem' differs from everyone elses', I admit - the fact that planes now have that extra four inches of leg room or whatever the useless bollocks means that I am absolutely unable to curl up comfortably in a plane seat now to try and sleep the trip through!  I end up right atop my poor lengthy little tailbone, and end up in stabbing misery for the entire ride. -__-<br /><br />As for McDonalds... as someone else said - if you don't eat it, you lose the 'immunity' to it.  I totally hope you get to feeling better, though, and manage other trips abroad to this lovely little island. :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"November 25 2009, 11:44:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://raeyn.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/userhead/557?v=1322058998","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"raeyn","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"raeyn","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://raeyn.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"raeyn","ctime_ts":1259149461,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/94456330/23605443","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?replyto=8017160","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8017160#t8017160","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8017160#t8017160","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8017160#t8017160","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"saxster","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://saxster.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8017160,"talkid":31317,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/119048.html?thread=8017160#t8017160","upictitle":"saxster: sax","article":"Well, George, I've had full-blown food-poisoning or allergic food reaction and I can tell you, what you experienced probably wasn't quite as severe, more than likely it was your body's natural reaction to the horridly high fat content in that food, the oils, and other poisons that are in most American processed foods, especially a fast-food chain.  I'm thankful you're OK!  This is just one more reason to never eat at a fast food restaurant again -- if they'd killed off my newest favorite author, I'd have to get in line to sue them!<br /><br />Before I forget, I've been playing this highly addictive, amazingly well-done new PC RPG from Bioware and it is most definitely inspired by your books.  It's called Dragon Age Origins, and if you turn on a TV set for more than an hour, you're probably going to see a commercial for it.  In my opinion it is Bioware that should do a full game version of your stories.  They are the best at what they do in the industry -- that's why LucasArts is working with them on the huge mass online RPG Star Wars The Old Republic with them -- and they do it right from offices here in Austin, TX, though the main Bioware offices for other productions are up in Edmonton.  Just thought I'd fill you in on my impressions.<br /><br />Have a wonderful holiday, and all I want for Christmas this year or next is another book from you!<br /><br />John","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"November 25 2009, 12:02:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Happy Thanksgiving!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://saxster.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"saxster","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"saxster","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://saxster.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"saxster","ctime_ts":1259150572,"tracked":0}]}
