{"itemid":853,"subject":"Casting?","event":"I may have been guilty of premature froggery in the \"Hiya, Kids\" post below.\r\n\r\nSecond season casting is in full swing, yes.  \r\n\r\nAnd we're close on a few roles.  Choices made, that is to say, but now we wait on HBO approval, and then of course we have to make a deal.  Not all deals close, much as you would like them to.  There's budget to consider, scheduling, all sorts of things.  \r\n\r\nOn other roles, well, we've seen a lot of readings, but we're not in love yet.  So the auditions continue.  In Ireland, in London, even in LA.\r\n\r\nBottom line: no one has been cast yet, so stop holding your breath.\r\n\r\nWhen we do sign some new cast, Froggy will give you the hints.  \r\n\r\n(Unless someone else breaks the news first).\r\n\r\n((Or unless it's after June 13.  That's the day I leave for Poland.  I'll be out of the loop while overseas, so after that date, the announcements are more like to come from elsewhere)).","ditemid":218461,"eventtime":"2011-05-29 14:57:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","commentalter":1306954427,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"hiya hiya hiya","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":2,"revtime":1306954509},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-05-29 20:57:15","anum":93,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html","event_timestamp":1306681020,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/65862744/1947702","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13712477#t13712477","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13712477#t13712477","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13712477#t13712477","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"puppetmaker40","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://puppetmaker40.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13712477,"talkid":53564,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13712477#t13712477","upictitle":"puppetmaker40: Peter David and Me","article":"George-<br />Peter and I wanted to tell you that we are enjoying the series totally and look forward to the second season as well.<br /><br />They did a good job filming the impossible.<br /><br />Kathleen David","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 29 2011, 21:00:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://puppetmaker40.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"puppetmaker40","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"puppetmaker40","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://puppetmaker40.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"puppetmaker40","ctime_ts":1306702834,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13713245#t13713245","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13713245#t13713245","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13713245#t13713245","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"xanthious","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://xanthious.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13713245,"talkid":53567,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218461.html?thread=13713245#t13713245","upictitle":"Eric: pic#0","article":"I sincerely hope you can find a spot for Roy Dotrice again.
