{"itemid":844,"subject":"Littlefinger and the Spider","event":"Judging by the comments I'm hearing, one of the favorite scenes in this week's episode of HBO's GAME OF THRONES was the throne room verbal sparring between Lord Varys and Lord Baelish.  (For which all credit goes to David Benioff and Dan Weiss.  The scene was not in the novel.  Which is not to say it could not have happened, but neither Petyr nor Varys is a viewpoint character, so I had no pov from which to present such a scene).\r\n\r\nSo for all you miniature collectors out there who would like to recreate such a scene in your own throne room diorama... here are the two latest releases from Dark Sword Miniature.  \r\n\r\nVARYS THE SPIDER\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g6hs4/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g6hs4/s640x480\" width=\"282\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLORD PETYR BAELISH\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g7t4b/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g7t4b\" width=\"271\" height=\"432\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBoth sculpts are by the talented Jeff Grace, who just keeps getting better.\r\n\r\n(And no, they don't look like the actors in the show.  They are not meant to.  Dark Sword is licensed to produce miniatures based on the novels, not the television series).\r\n\r\nYou can order these, and the rest of the amazing Ice & Fire line, from the Dark Sword website at http://darkswordminiatures.com/   There's a gorgeous painted version of Varys up there as I write, and a painted Littlefinger will not be far behind.\r\n\r\n((Just a reminder.  I've mentioned the show here, but that does not mean I am opening up the Not a Blog to discussion of the series.  Oh, a passing mention is okay, but serious debates and discussions should be taken to Westeros, Tower of the Hand, Television Without Pity, or Winter Is Coming.  Comments are open here... for comments about the miniatures.))","ditemid":216214,"eventtime":"2011-05-14 12:21:00","props":{"taglist":"miniatures, dark sword","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1306097828,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"tyrion","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1306701878},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-05-16 18:23:45","anum":150,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html","event_timestamp":1305375660,"reply_count":33,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/100979342/3069787","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520534#t13520534","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520534#t13520534","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520534#t13520534","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trystan830","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trystan830.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13520534,"talkid":52814,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520534#t13520534","upictitle":"Trystan: Trystan","article":"oh those are awesome!  they all are!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 16 2011, 18:28:35 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://trystan830.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"trystan830","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"trystan830","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://trystan830.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"trystan830","ctime_ts":1305570515,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/21581517/4838556","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520790#t13520790","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520790#t13520790","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520790#t13520790","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lonemagpie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lonemagpie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13520790,"talkid":52815,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13520790#t13520790","upictitle":"lonemagpie: Guy","article":"Those are great - can't wait to see what talented figure painters (that's not me, sadly!) make of them...<br /><br />Aw crap, and I've just realised I missed last week's episode...<br /><br />There's going to be a DVD set, right?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 16 2011, 18:32:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lonemagpie.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lonemagpie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lonemagpie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lonemagpie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lonemagpie","ctime_ts":1305570730,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/60344823/12661625","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13522582#t13522582","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13522582#t13522582","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13522582#t13522582","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13522582#t13522582","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mustajumala","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mustajumala.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13522582,"talkid":52822,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13522582#t13522582","upictitle":"mustajumala: pic#60344823","article":"...not featured in the book.

show licensing in the post, I can pretend it's almost relevant! <br /><br />I'm a sculptor/artist and there's a particular piece I've desperately wanted to sculpt for some time now. I might just make one for myself (and mayhaps to have on display as \"fan art\" in the Comicon art show), but would love at some point to try and work out a limited licensed run with you (if you were at all interested, of course). Considering how busy you are these days I'm sure the thought of any new licensing relationships might be the last thing you want to deal with. And, I was chatting with Jed of Valyrian Resin (he's a buddy of mine, actually lives walking distance from my house... small world!) and he mentioned that all new licensing might be tied up with HBO. <br /><br />I guess that is what I'm curious about. Has HBO put a hold on any new licensing on your end, or are you still free to do so as long as it's strictly from the books and not the tv show in any way?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 17 2011, 05:48:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Book vs. Show licensing?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ghoulgurl.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ghoulgurl","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ghoulgurl","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ghoulgurl.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ghoulgurl","ctime_ts":1305611329,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13534870#t13534870","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13534870#t13534870","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13534870#t13534870","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13534870#t13534870","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13534870,"talkid":52870,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216214.html?thread=13534870#t13534870","above":13534614,"upictitle":"George R.R.
