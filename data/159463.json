{"itemid":622,"subject":"No News Is No News","event":"Sorry, no casting puzzles for you today.\r\n\r\nOffers are out on quite a few parts, both major and minor, but I'm not aware of any deals closing besides the ones already announced.  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe next week.  Who knows?  These things can take time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, readings and auditions continue for a lot of other roles, and I've been reviewing tapes when I can.  Lots and lots of kids of late.  Mycah.  Rickon.  Tommen.  Myrcella.  Casting kids is really tough, especially when they only have a very few lines.  Sometimes you get lucky and find someone like Maisie or Sophie or Isaac, with acting chops far beyond their years, a real instinct for the art.  Those are the rare exceptions.  Most kids... well, they can look great, and they try hard, and maybe in a few years they will be terrific... but right now, they're just kids reciting lines.  They never become the character.  So the search goes on.  But I've got every confidence that David and Dan and Nina will turn up someone great, even for the small parts (and maybe we already have, I haven't finished reviewing all the kids yet, not even close).\r\n\r\nThe auditions for the part of Ser Ilyn Payne are the strangest I've even been witness to.  Ser Ilyn has no tongue and no lines, of course, so the actors just have to stand there and look mean & scary, reacting to the dialogue of other characters being read to them by the casting assistants.  No words to work with, just their mouth, eyes, facial expressions.  Talk about challenging.\r\n\r\nI know there are aspiring actors and actresses reading this.  You guys have all my empathy.  It's a tough, tough profession you've chosen.  Good luck to all of you.","ditemid":159463,"eventtime":"2010-06-30 00:25:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1278887541,"picture_keyword":"tiger","personifi_word_count":300,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"28:17,6:3,10:7,33:10,11:10,32:10,3:7,24:7,25:10,20:21,9:32,21:7,14:3,nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-06-30 06:25:23","anum":231,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html","event_timestamp":1277857500,"reply_count":37,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/78632275/1173949","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?replyto=10423783","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10423783#t10423783","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10423783#t10423783","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10423783#t10423783","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"3appleshigh","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://3appleshigh.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10423783,"talkid":40717,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10423783#t10423783","upictitle":"Cricket: pool","article":"so excited for this series. =)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"June 30 2010, 06:39:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://3appleshigh.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"3appleshigh","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"3appleshigh","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://3appleshigh.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"3appleshigh","ctime_ts":1277879972,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123700388/259210","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?replyto=10424039","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10424039#t10424039","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10424039#t10424039","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10424039#t10424039","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mentalpiracy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mentalpiracy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10424039,"talkid":40718,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10424039#t10424039","upictitle":"Carrie: Paony","article":"Sounds like some interesting things to go through for this series.

So you have to find kids who can handle those parts.  And also, I imagine the show is also looking for kids who aren't going to suddenly start looking twenty at fourteen, since you don't know if the series will go beyond the first book and if it does, how long that will take.  Which has to be frustrating, especially when casting \"minor\" parts that have the potential to become semi-main characters if the show goes on long enough.<br /><br />I'm sure that the people who have it will do a fantastic job.  They have so far with the casting that has been announced, plus HBO has a history of well-cast television shows.  It just has got to be a headache.<br /><br />Also, I apologize if this is incoherent, it's after 3:30am here and I'm not all the way awake.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"June 30 2010, 07:52:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mortisnightmare.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mortisnightmare","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mortisnightmare","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mortisnightmare.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mortisnightmare","ctime_ts":1277884338,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?replyto=10425063","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10425063#t10425063","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10425063#t10425063","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10425063#t10425063","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"oteckre","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://oteckre.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10425063,"talkid":40722,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159463.html?thread=10425063#t10425063","upictitle":"oteckre: pic#0","article":":) Its really both funny and impressive to imagine an audition for Ilyn Payne.
