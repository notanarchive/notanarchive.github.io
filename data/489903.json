Keeping the old category just encouraged the voters to keep on nominating as they had before, while ignoring the new category.<br /><br />Also, it should have been \"Best Cover\" instead of \"Best Original Artwork.\"  I understand the desire to be inclusive and allow people to nominate interior illustrations, gallery art, and whatever, but the truth is, covers have always been what the artist Hugo is all about.  Let's stop pretending it's not.  Freas, Emshwiller, Whelan, Eggleton, Donato, Picacio and all the rest won their rockets on the strength of their cover work.  No artist who does not do covers has ever won a Hugo.  <br /><br />Making it \"Best Cover\" makes it about the art, not the artist.  Writers have a big advantage over artists in that their names are emblazoned on the covers of their books.  With artists, we can see a spectacular piece of work without knowing who did it... like, for instance, the incredible cover for Vic Milan's novel, mentioned above.  People nominate the same artists year after year because those are the only artists whose names they know.  It's very hard for someone new to break through and get their name known.<br /><br />It would be easier if the voters could just nominate say, \"the cover of DINOSAUR LORDS,\" without having to know the artist's name.  <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"11 months ago","ctime":"June 11 2016, 19:04:12 UTC","parent":24610735,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1465671852,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/96744317/4545815","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/489903.html?thread=24612271#t24612271","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/489903.html?thread=24612271#t24612271","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/489903.html?thread=24612271#t24612271","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kevin_standlee","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24612271,"talkid":96141,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/489903.html?thread=24612271#t24612271","above":24612015,"upictitle":"Kevin Standlee: Hugo Logo","article":"You have a reasonable point about cover art over other works, but would you then exclude the \"cover\" artwork for e-books because they weren't printed on pieces of paper?
