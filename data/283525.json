{"itemid":1107,"subject":"Yadda Yadda Yadda","event":"For those of you out there who have not yet gotten your fill of hearing me talk as yet, there are a couple of new interviews up on the net that you might want to check out.\r\n\r\nFrom my visit to the UK in April, an interview with British television personality and journalist Grace Dent (beware, there are some BIG SPOILERS in this one).\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"314\"/>\r\n\r\n((The interview was actually much longer than that.  They added some spiff visuals and clips of the show, but trimmed some of the Q and especially the A... and also said some rather extravagant stuff about yours truly that made my modesty klaxon go off as I watched it.  Still, a fun interview.  At least for me)).\r\n\r\nAnd for the popular webcast Sword & Laser, here I am again, just last week:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"315\"/>\r\n\r\nThe Sword & Laser episode also contains an episode with the fellow who wrote the book about philosophy in GAME OF THRONES, a discussion of Guy Gavriel Kay's novel TIGANA, and some other cool stuff.  And check out their excellent interview with James S.A. Corey from a couple of episodes back as well.","ditemid":283525,"eventtime":"2012-06-26 23:09:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"interviews","current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1344641258,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"revtime":1344641294},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-06-27 05:09:07","anum":133,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/283525.html","event_timestamp":1340752140,"reply_count":28,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/94456330/23605443","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/283525.html?thread=16176773#t16176773","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/283525.html?thread=16176773#t16176773","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/283525.html?thread=16176773#t16176773","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"saxster","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://saxster.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16176773,"talkid":63190,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/283525.html?thread=16176773#t16176773","upictitle":"saxster: sax","article":"Enjoyed both interviews very much, but I'll have to give the hat tip to Grace Dent because she got far more in-depth about your inspirations.

People don't say that nearly enough. Any criticism that may result is in my view warped love.

If we don't like what's happened to a favourite character, we're not meant to and that's true to life. Good things happen to bad people in Westeros as much as bad things happen to the good (sob. Ned) as happens now and has happened throughout history. Your books are worth the wait and in this age of the digital and disposable they will always be taking up vast swathes of my bookcase and being re-read and leant to friends.

I was, of course, already hooked on Jon and the other characters so I picked the book back up.  After a few more pages I found Joffrey and his hound.  I had to put the book down again. It was at this time that I realized that this book had invoked a great amount of emotion from me.
