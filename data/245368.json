{"itemid":958,"subject":"Autographs for Texas","event":"Just returned from a quick two-day trip to Dallas, where I flew in to address a national conference of managers from the Hastings bookstore chain.  Great fun.  The Hastings folks were wonderful hosts, and have done a terrific job of selling my books.  A whole bunch of them told me that the midnight launches of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS back in July were a huge success.\r\n\r\nNo public appearances were on my calendar this trip, but since I don't get to Texas very often these days, I did make sure I did some stock signings for my neglected Dallas readers.  So if you're looking for a copy defaced with my illegible scrawl, you will find some at the Barnes & Noble stores at Preston Royal, Lincoln Park,and Los Colinas... for as long as the supply lasts.\r\n\r\nI did not, alas, make it to the B&N in Denton, where back in 1996 I had my traumatic encounter with Clifford, the Big Red Dog.","ditemid":245368,"eventtime":"2011-10-26 16:34:00","props":{"current_location":"home again","taglist":"travels, signed books","commentalter":1320162942,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1320183049},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-10-26 22:40:22","anum":120,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245368.html","event_timestamp":1319646840,"reply_count":20,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245368.html?thread=14881144#t14881144","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245368.html?thread=14881144#t14881144","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245368.html?thread=14881144#t14881144","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hitman8d","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hitman8d.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14881144,"talkid":58129,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245368.html?thread=14881144#t14881144","article":"You do have many Texas fans.
