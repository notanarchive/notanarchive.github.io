{"itemid":1764,"subject":"Three Cheers For Snod","event":"Wanted to take a moment here to congratulate my old friend, sometimes collarborator, co-editor, and general partner in crime MELINDA M. SNODGRASS on her new gig.  Melinda is headed back to LA to head up the writing staff of STAR TREK: RENEGADES, a new fan-funded Trek web series that features Walter Koenig as Chekov.  Melinda will be an executive producer.\r\n\r\nOf course, Snod is no stranger to Trek.  She was one of the writers on NEXT GENERATION, where she scripted, among other episodes, \"Measure of a Man,\" still widely regarded as one of the best five Trek episodes of all team.  She'll do a great job on this new show, I have no doubt.\r\n\r\nYou can read all about this on Melinda's own blog at:\r\n              http://melindasnodgrass.com/star-trek-renegades\r\n\r\n((I know a lot of you Trek fans out there will be excited about this, and there will doubtless be lots of questions... that's the place to ask 'em, not here.  Thanks.))\r\n\r\nAlso, here's the link to the Kickstarter page funding RENEGADES:\r\n     https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/145553614/star-trek-renegades-episodes-2-and-3   \r\n\r\nSounds like a fun series.

They did well with their first effort out of the gate, but having her writing, vision, and drive with them now - great things will be coming, believe it.<br /><br />I'm a large contributor to the Star Trek Axanar effort now.  Check them out if you haven't, their pilot/prelude is stunning for how much they made it for.<br /><br />It warms me to see former actors participating in these fan and community driven efforts - and now with writers with major horsepower joining in such as Snodgrass, the snowball effect will soon be knocking on the door of CBS/Paramount vis a vis ST IMO.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 30 2015, 21:56:30 UTC","parent":22944776,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gman109","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gman109","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"October 30 2015, 21:57:39 UTC","dname":"gman109","ctime_ts":1446242190,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125210192/70950218","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945544#t22945544","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945544#t22945544","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945544#t22945544","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cashcraig","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cashcraig.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22945544,"talkid":89631,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945544#t22945544","upictitle":"Cash Craig: pic#125210192","article":"I've never seen any Star Trek... but judging by my experience with DOUBLE SOLITAIRE, I'd bet those episodes will be a great wild ride.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 30 2015, 03:31:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cashcraig.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cashcraig","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cashcraig","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cashcraig.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cashcraig","ctime_ts":1446175871,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123903486/72071300","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945800#t22945800","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945800#t22945800","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945800#t22945800","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2738803","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/OberynMattell","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22945800,"talkid":89632,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22945800#t22945800","upictitle":"Oberyn Mattell: pic#123903486","article":"This is interesting how it works with the rights and all.

I do also think there is room for co-operation.  Example, CBS isn't putting a dime into Axanar's production, so if Axanar does become a success endeavor in terms or profit, why sue them when you could work WITH them in the future, and share in that success by giving permission as opposed to withholding it and filing lawsuits.  It's a complicated issue, but again, I favor the laws on protecting work, and also favor positive co-op when there is room for it.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"November 1 2015, 03:18:52 UTC","parent":22945800,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gman109","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gman109","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"gman109","ctime_ts":1446347932,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125544754/76993950","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22946824#t22946824","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22946824#t22946824","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22946824#t22946824","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3363832","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/TheTVGod","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22946824,"talkid":89636,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/451592.html?thread=22946824#t22946824","upictitle":"Brian Sherman: pic#125544754","article":"I really enjoyed the first Renegades and having Melinda on the next two can only make it better.
