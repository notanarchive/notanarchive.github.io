{"itemid":758,"subject":"Yawn","event":"Yes, of course I watched the Superbowl.  I'm a football fan.  Pro football, anyway.  I always watch the Superbowl.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a blowout, as so many Superbowls have been in the past.  Looked like it might turn into that early on, when the Packers opened up a big early lead, but the Steelers came back in the second half and for a while it looked as though they might snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  \r\n\r\nIt wasn't a thriller either.  Not one of the great contests.  Mediocre play, for the most part.  The last few SBs have spoiled us.  Kind of a yawner.  \r\n\r\nBut maybe that's because I had no strong rooting interest.  It's amazing how big a difference that can make.  The games that involve me most are those featuring one of my teams, of course... but I can also get pretty worked up by a contest featuring one of the \"bad guy\" teams I love to hate, like the Cowboys or the Pats.  In those, at least, I have someone to root against.  The Steelers and the Pack, though... don't love 'em, don't hate 'em, so it's hard to stay emotionally involved.  \r\n\r\nI do like good play, no matter who's involved, but there weren't many spectacular plays in this SB either.  Nothing to compare to the Tyree catch or the Santonio Holmes reception.\r\n\r\nEven the commercials seemed kind of boring this year.  I've already forgotten most of 'em.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm sure you Terrible Towel Wavers out there are crushed right now, and all you Cheeseheads are telling each other this was the best SB even.  So condolences to the former, and congrats to the latter.\r\n\r\nNext year I want Jets v, Giants.   Sobway Superbowl!!!","ditemid":194145,"eventtime":"2011-02-06 23:23:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":5,"commentalter":1297291670,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":301,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"28:6,31:3,10:12,37:6,32:6,3:19,25:6,4:9,20:9,9:19,21:9,13:12,nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1297359069},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-02-07 06:23:35","anum":97,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194145.html","event_timestamp":1297034580,"reply_count":37,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/102880121/29364589","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194145.html?thread=11938401#t11938401","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194145.html?thread=11938401#t11938401","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194145.html?thread=11938401#t11938401","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hinka83","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hinka83.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11938401,"talkid":46634,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194145.html?thread=11938401#t11938401","article":"Even that i'm not an american I recognized that the us anthem wasn't correct... how can something like this happen?
