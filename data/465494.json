{"itemid":1818,"subject":"Thanks","event":"The outpouring of support in response to my post on THE WINDS OF WINTER has been astonishing.\r\n\r\nThank you all, so very much.\r\n\r\nThere were forty pages of screened comments on the post by the time I logged on this morning.  I haven't even been able to read half of them as yet.  So if I haven't unscreened yours yet, be patient.  (My loyal minions often do much of that for me, but they all have off right now for the New Year holiday).\r\n\r\nI am going to close comments on this post, lest I have even more messages to deal with.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot tell you how much I appreciate all the kind words and good wishes.","ditemid":465494,"eventtime":"2016-01-02 22:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"rejuvenated","current_location":"Santa Fe","opt_nocomments":1,"taglist":"a song of ice and fire, fandom","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Jan  3 05:36:02 2016]R [Sun Jan  3 05:36:04 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683522192567480320 ","current_moodid":62,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683522192567480320","give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.592598279324505]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451799417}"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-03 05:36:00","anum":86,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/465494.html","event_timestamp":1451774160,"reply_count":0}
