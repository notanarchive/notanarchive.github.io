{"itemid":1399,"subject":"Season Four Is Coming...","event":"&nbsp;... to Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, it&#39;s coming to the rest of the country too.&nbsp; HBO will broadcast episode one of season 4, entitled... ooops, sorry, don&#39;t think I am allowed to reveal the title yet... on Sunday, April 6.\r\n\r\nBut on<b><i> Saturday, March 29</i></b>,&nbsp; 375 lucky New Mexicans will get a chance to see what the rest of the country will need to wait another week and day for. &nbsp; I am thrilled to announce that on that day, by special arrangement with HBO, we will be presenting three advance screenings of episode 401 at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\nLast year, many of you will recall, HBO had a gala Season 3 Premiere in Los Angeles, with a huge red carpet screening at Grauman&#39;s Chinese Theatre, followed by an incredible party at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel across the street.&nbsp; Even if you weren&#39;t there, you probably saw the pictures.&nbsp; That LA premiere was followed by advance screenings and premiere parties in San Francisco and Seattle, which were almost as exciting.\r\n\r\nOur Santa Fe event will not be <b><i>THE</i></b> Premiere for season four.&nbsp; One of those is in the works, for a city considerably larger than Santa Fe and a theatre considerably larger than the Jean Cocteau, but I will leave it for HBO to make that announcement when the time is ripe.\r\n\r\nOur Santa Fe screenings will follow the big red carpet premiere, the way San Francisco and Seattle followed LA last year.&nbsp; We expect to have a red carpet too, though I make no promises about who might show up to walk on it... besides myself, of course. <b><i> I&#39;ll </i></b>be there, for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/190303/190303_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister_photo Macall B.Polay_HBO\" height=\"399\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/190303/190303_600.jpg\" title=\"Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister_photo Macall B.Polay_HBO\" width=\"600\" /></a>\r\nphoto Macall B. Polay HBO\r\n\r\nThe Jean Cocteau is a small hall, with only 125 seats, so we will be showing the episode three times.\r\n\r\nThe evening screening is by invitation only.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s the red carpet screening.&nbsp; And there will be a huge party following at the Sanbusco Center right across the parking lot from the Cocteau.&nbsp; That&#39;s by invitation only too, alas.&nbsp; Sorry.\r\n\r\nBut we wanted to do something for the fans as well.&nbsp; So even before the VIP screening and party, we&#39;ll be showing episode 401 twice that day, for a few lucky members of the general public.&nbsp; There will be one screening in the afternoon, and one that morning.&nbsp; And here&#39;s something cool: the first show, the morning show, will be the <b><i>Spanish language</i></b> version of episode 401.&nbsp; New Mexico has a huge Hispanic community, and we wanted to include them as well... so in a sense, the Santa Fe premiere WILL be a world premiere... for Spanish.&nbsp; (The afternoon showing will be English).\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/190643/190643_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon_photo Macall B.
