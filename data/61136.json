{"itemid":238,"subject":"I Hate Football","event":"Life is miserable and full of pain.\r\n\r\nA truly wretched day of football today.  Both of my teams sucked big time.\r\n\r\nHard to say which was the most miserable performance.  Eli played pretty well for the Giants, but his receivers dropped every ball he threw at them, as if they were determined to prove that, yes, the team will miss Plaxico big time.  In the afternoon game, well, the Jet offense was okay, but the defense couldn't stop the 49ers.  They just marched up and down the field at will.  Singletary has that team playing much harder than Nolan did.  The Jets game also had some truly awful and one-sided officiating by Ed Hochuli and his crew.  The turning point of the contest may well have been when Leon Washington's long return for a TD was called back on a phantom holding call.  I don't know what's happened to Hochuli.  In past years, he's been one of the NFL's best refs, but this year he and his crew have been terrible.  It seems as if they blow a call every week... and a BIG call at that.  Not that the Jets did not deserve to lose.  These last two weeks, they've been playing as if they thought the season ended with the Titans game.\r\n\r\nPfui.","ditemid":61136,"eventtime":"2008-12-07 17:26:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":223,"current_moodid":7,"commentalter":1229420097,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-12-08 00:34:02","anum":208,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html","event_timestamp":1228670760,"reply_count":41,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?replyto=4771280","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4771280#t4771280","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4771280#t4771280","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4771280#t4771280","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thenetsorcerer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thenetsorcerer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4771280,"talkid":18637,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4771280#t4771280","upictitle":"thenetsorcerer: pic#55195895","article":"Buck up!<br />As a fellow Giants fan it is sad to see them lose but teams have off days and that is definitely the case here.

My Seahawks played well for the first 3-1/2 quarters, then found a way to lose again,to Evil Little Bill and his Pats.  2-11 and in the Abyss of the NFC Worst.  The only bright spot to the season is we still play the Rams one more time.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"December 8 2008, 03:50:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bbeitel.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bbeitel","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bbeitel","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bbeitel.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bbeitel","ctime_ts":1228708254,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?replyto=4778960","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4778960#t4778960","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4778960#t4778960","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4778960#t4778960","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tominsparks","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tominsparks.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4778960,"talkid":18667,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61136.html?thread=4778960#t4778960","upictitle":"tominsparks: pic#82660926","article":"As a Ice and Fire fan, I regret your disappointment with today's results, however, as a life-long Dolphins fan, I am elated.

As a fan you had to see this one coming.<br />This was the first cold windy winter game at Giant Stadium in over a season. Giants play calling both on offense and defense lacked conviction. And, yes the media and public maelstrom around the Plaxico/Pierce situation played a part. During this past week they simply didn't appear or sound like the relaxed and confident team as they had been all season long. Give the Eagles credit. Westbrook is lethal when healthy. Their offensive line played stellar ball on run and pass. McNabb has his babies (didn't know about that) and is managing rather than trying to be the hero. It's a good thing that they have that \"1\". They could make Superbowl noise if the unlikely happens and they make the playoffs.<br /><br />Good news. Plax has left the building and Pierce has immunity and after Monday it will be football as normal for the G-Men. Don't get giddy. The 'Boys look like they are peaking too. They scare me more than any other team in the NFL. Oh, one more complaint. Why, Oh why, did they elect to receive at the start of the game? Well I guess we could blame global warming. They are out of practice with bad Giant Stadium weather. The Giants always take the wind advantage in the fourth quarter. Not that it would have made a tremendous difference today.<br /><br />Jets.
