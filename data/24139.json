Lots of fun, but it certainly added to the misery of that embarrassing defeat.<br /><br />I'd say the Colts are done challenging the Patriots for this season.  They're so injured right now, and losing Dwight Freeney for the year is an absolutely lethal blow to their defense.  The Steelers may be able to challenge though.  Their only two losses this year came to the Cardinals and the Broncos.  On the surface, these are two terrible losses, but when you break them down they're not so bad.  Both were on the road.  The Cardinals' head coach is Ken Wizzenhunt, who only last year was coaching in Pittsburgh.  He knows the weaknesses of the players, which enabled him to come out with a solid game-plan.  And I'll toss the Broncos loss out the window.  That thin mountain air took its toll on the defense.  Other than the Broncos, the only teams even remotely used to to playing in that stadium are in the same division.  So it comes down to what the Steelers do against the Patriots in their upcoming match.  A win would be nice, but so long as the Steelers play them close I have faith they could challenge the Pats in the post-season.<br /><br />As to the NFC, the Packers may be able to challenge the Boys.  Three games ago, they had everything but a running attack.  But over the last two games, Ryan Grant has rushed over 100 yards, including against the Vikings, a team with a very strong rushing defense.  Grant doesn't need to be great, just good.  The Packers' passing attack is so lethal this year they can actually use it to set up their run.  If Ryan Grant can keep it up, the Packers are a legitimate threat.  That Packers-Cowboys in a few weeks will be huge.<br /><br />As to those Giants ...they need to keep revamping that secondary in the off-season.  Aaron Ross looks pretty good for a rookie, but Sam Madison and McQuarters are old.  We also need better safeties.  Gibril Wilson makes big plays, but he also gives up the big pass.  The other guy is a joke.

Our defense had to keep taking the field, and <i>they</i> were exhausted by the fourth quarter.  The Patriots challenged and we were out of gas.<br /><br />It's not just injuries; we should have played better in the second half overall.
