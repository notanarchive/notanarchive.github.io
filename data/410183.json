{"itemid":1602,"subject":"For Your Consideration: Stuff By Me","event":"THE WINDS OF WINTER did not come out in 2014, as some of you noticed.  But I did have a lot of other material published and broadcast that is eligible for Hugo consideration.\r\n\r\nThe fourth season of HBO's GAME OF THRONES leads that list.  'Dramatic Presentation' is split into two categories, Short Form and Long Form.  The former is mostly TV shows, the latter mostly films, though the actual division is by running time.  GAME OF THRONES is actually eligible in both categories... though should it be nominated in both, the rules require us to bow out of one in favor of the other.  \r\n\r\nSeason four, considered as a whole, can be nominated in Long Form.\r\n\r\nIndividual episodes are eligible for nomination in Short Form.  You do need to know the episode titles.  And yes, more than one episode of a given show can be nominated.  Last year at Loncon the Short Form shortlist pitted one episode of ORPHAN BLACK and one episode of GAME OF THRONES against four episodes of DOCTOR WHO.  That's not unusual.  The DR. WHO fans are very well organized.  \r\n\r\nI am, to be sure, enormously prejudiced, but I thought we had some very strong episodes last season.  Of course, I am very proud of episode two, \"The Lion and the Rose,\" since I wrote the script myself for that one.  For those of you who don't remember titles, that was the 'purple wedding' episode.  Episode nine, \"The Watchers on the Walls,\" scripted by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss and directed by Neil Marshall, was also huge for us: that was the battle episode, devoted entirely to the fight for the Wall.  Biggest action sequences we've ever done.  Dan and David also scripted episode ten, \"The Children,\" with the final confrontation between the Imp and his father.  Oh, and there was also \"The Laws of Gods and Men,\" aka the Trial of Tyrion Lannister, scripted by Byron Cogman, with its amazing performances by Peter Dinklage and Sibel Kekilli, and \"The Mountain and the Viper,\" another script by Dan and Dave, wherein the Mountain That Rides faces off against the Red Viper of Dorne.\r\n\r\nThe other five episodes had some good stuff too, I think.  \r\n\r\nAside from the television show...\r\n\r\nROGUES was published last year, which means that Gardner Dozois and I are both eligible for nomination as Best Editor, Short Form.  Also, all the stories in ROGUES are eligible in the Short Story and Novelette categories.  We had some terrific stories in that book.  Take a look.\r\n\r\nLOWBALL, the twenty-second volume in the Wild Cards series, was also published in 2014.  That one I co-edited with Melinda Snodgrass.  (Shared world stories <i><b>NEVER</b></i> get nominated for Hugos, but I mention this for the sake of completeness).\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the odd duck: THE WORLD OF ICE & FIRE, the huge and concordance of the world of Westeros by Elio Garcia, Linda Antonnson, and yours truly.  Exhaustive, gorgeously illustrated throughout, and years in the making.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/237748/237748_600.jpg\" alt=\"WOIAF cover\" title=\"WOIAF cover\"> \r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I am not sure what category the worldbook belongs in.  It's not a novel in any traditional sense, and there's no \"fake history\" category, so I suppose it fits best in \"Best Related Book.\"\r\n\r\nLastly... and not strictly by me... I want to mention the latest Ice & Fire calendar.  It's the 2015 calendar, but it came out in July 2014, debuting at Comicon.  The calendar itself is not eligible for anything... but the artist certainly is.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/237994/237994_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/237994/237994_600.jpg\" alt=\"2015ASoIaF-Calendar-Cover-Donato\" title=\"2015ASoIaF-Calendar-Cover-Donato\"></a>\r\n\r\nThe 2015 calender was painted by DONATO GIANCOLA, and if he doesn't deserve a nomination for Best Professional Artist for his work therein, I don't know who does.","ditemid":410183,"eventtime":"2015-03-08 17:57:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, awards, hbo","current_moodid":43,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1426184590,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" For Your Consideration: Stuff By Me http://j.mp/1NyjTXA","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.653308141390178]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1425859008}","revtime":1426206892},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-08 23:55:53","anum":71,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html","event_timestamp":1425837420,"reply_count":32,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20334919#t20334919","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20334919#t20334919","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20334919#t20334919","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bighdog","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bighdog.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20334919,"talkid":79433,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20334919#t20334919","upictitle":"bighdog: pic#0","article":"I like how the first thing you say is I know The Winds of Winter did not come out in 2014. lol","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"March 8 2015, 23:59:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hugo nominations","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bighdog.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bighdog","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bighdog","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bighdog.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bighdog","ctime_ts":1425859171,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20335175#t20335175","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20335175#t20335175","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20335175#t20335175","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"m777z","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://m777z.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20335175,"talkid":79434,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410183.html?thread=20335175#t20335175","upictitle":"m777z: pic#0","article":"Looks like this year's Hugos might be very kind to you!

Any piece that is born from your soul is never less than brilliant! Your grasp of the human condition, the basic needs of not just your characters but of your audience as well is so fascinating due to the ease of being able to identify with their struggles, their fears,   passion and heartbreak. <br /><br />I believe that all of the options mentioned above deserves the highest praise and honor. HOWEVER...a few (million) of us are bearing a huge burden. You see, there is this book you may have mentioned at some point titled \"The Winds of Winter\" that is creating OUR human condition to become almost feral, crazed and mostly desperate. A few of our favorite characters have been left in peril or possibly dead. We feel a bitter consternation because we have ALL adopted these fictional peoples into our lives and we are HELPLESS to aid them. Many of us rely on 're-read' projects and thoughtfully theorize these characters fates. It is becoming monotonous! We have begun to lead Unproductive lives and we are heart sick. <br /><br />I wish you well with the Hugo awards. To many of us you are the Zeus of story telling and no one deserves the awards more. <br /><br />But please, on behalf bended knee, i beg for you to free us from this heartache and release TWOW SOON. WE ARE WAITING...
