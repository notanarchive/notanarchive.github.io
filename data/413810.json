Probably I will make some (many of them) mistakes. <br /><br />About three years ago, I started to see a TV show. At that time, it had just finished its second season, and that summer I bought three books in which the show was based. Before the end of the next year, I had read the fives books in the series. That books were written by one George R. R. Martin and at that time I was already deeply in love with A song of ice and fire.<br /><br />Then, I started posting on a forum about your books and there I met the woman of my life. Thanks to you and your books, I met the most wonderful woman in the world and that's something I will eternally thank you, George.<br /><br />A big hug from Dorne.
