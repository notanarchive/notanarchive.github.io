{"itemid":1688,"subject":"And Speaking of Wild Cards...","event":"... I am thrilled to report that we've completed and delivered the latest Wild Cards mosaic novel, HIGH STAKES.  The day before I left for Chicago, I shipped off the massive (truly) manuscript to Diana Pho, our new editor at Tor.\r\n\r\nHIGH STAKES is the third and concluding volume in the triad that began with FORT FREAK and continued with LOWBALL.  Aces and jokers and Lovecraftian horrors, what more could you ask?  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/256663/256663_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/256939/256939_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe contributing writers this time around are Melinda M. Snodgrass, John Jos. Miller, David Anthony Durham, Caroline Spector, Stephen Leigh, and Ian Tregillis.  Featured viewpoint characters, respectively: Francis Xavier (Franny) Black, the Midnight Angel, Marcus (Infamous Black Tongue) Morgan, the Amazing Bubbles, Barbara (Babel) Baden, and Mollie (Tesseract) Steunenberg.  You'll also see plenty of Lohengrin, Carnifex, Hoodoo Mama, Baba Yaga, and all sorts of other characters, both new and old.\r\n\r\nAs usual, it was a bitch to edit.  But I think you'll like it.\r\n\r\nLook for it next year, in the spring.  More details when I have 'em.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile... YES!... another monkey off my back!!!","ditemid":432364,"eventtime":"2015-07-07 12:46:00","props":{"current_mood":"accomplished","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, anthologies, editing","current_moodid":90,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1457560993,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"And Speaking of Wild Cards... http://goo.gl/rbVbxq","picture_keyword":"ape","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.640530151319748]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1436294831}","revtime":1436896254},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-07 18:46:20","anum":236,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html","event_timestamp":1436273160,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125197640/76403614","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21907436#t21907436","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21907436#t21907436","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21907436#t21907436","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3218227","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153407037165242/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21907436,"talkid":85575,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21907436#t21907436","upictitle":"Michael Montazeri: pic#125197640","article":"Awesome, can't wait to pick it up.

R. Scott Bakker has finished and delivered the manuscript for <i>The Unholy Consult</i> to his publishers back in January, yet has heard <b>nothing</b> from Overlook since about editing or publication date. I understand you know Bakker and can probably sympathize with fans waiting an unusually long time for a sequel. The fact that the delay solely results from publisher holdups only compounds our frustration, particularly for a conclusion to a trilogy. I hope you appreciate what Bakker is trying to do for fantasy, any spotlight you can shine on this helps!<br /><br />Here's a link to Wert's writeup on the situation:<br /><br />http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2015/06/s<wbr />cott-bakkers-unholy-consult-delayed.html","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 8 2015, 02:19:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Bolivar687","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Bolivar687","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1702699","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=61750838&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Bolivar687","ctime_ts":1436321977,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123931444/72125338","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21925356#t21925356","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21925356#t21925356","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21925356#t21925356","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21925356#t21925356","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2748239","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/vera.deferran","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21925356,"talkid":85645,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432364.html?thread=21925356#t21925356","upictitle":"Vera de Ferran: pic#123931444","article":"I always thought the wild cards were an ongoing story.
