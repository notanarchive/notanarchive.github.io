Go here: https://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/2016-hugo-ballot/\r\n\r\nThe Hugo is science fiction's oldest and most prestigious award.  These past few years, however, the awards have been under siege, and that's true this year as well.   \r\n\r\nNonetheless, there are some worthy books and stories up for this year's rockets, along with some reprehensible shit.
