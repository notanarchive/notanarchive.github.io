{"itemid":1753,"subject":"Cinemax Orders SKIN TRADE Script","event":"I am very excited to announce the Cinemax (HBO's sister company) has optioned the television rights to \"The Skin Trade,\" the offbeat \"werewolf noir\" novella I penned back in the late 80s.  The deal is closed, and Cinemax has ordered the pilot script.  This being Hollywood, of course, you never know where things will end... but if they like the script, we'll shoot a pilot, and if they like that, hey, who knows, maybe we'll get a series on the air.\r\n\r\nWhich would be very cool.  I have always thought there was a TV series (or maybe a feature film) in Willie Flambeaux and Randi Wade.  Those of you who know the story of DOORWAYS, my ill-fated ABC pilot from the early 90s, may even recall that it was SKIN TRADE that I was actually trying to sell back in 1991, when I flew out to LA for a round of pitch meetings.  So we're a few decades late... \r\n\r\n\"The Skin Trade\" has had a storied, and complex, publishing history.  It was originally written for NIGHT VISION 5, the fifth volume of the prestigious annual horror anthology from the late lamented small press Dark Harvest, where it appeared together with original contributions from Dan Simmons and Stephen King, some stellar company.  The novella was very well received, and went on to win that year's World Fantasy Award.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/290630/290630_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/290989/290989_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nIt was subsequently reprinted several times, most recently (and notably) in an illustrated edition from Capclave, where I was Guest of Honor, with a cover and interior art by the amazing Rick Berry.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/292540/292540_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThere's also been a comic book miniseries and graphic novel from Avatar.  Daniel Abraham did the adaptation and script, while Mike Wolfer provided the art.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/291522/291522_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/291691/291691_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/291846/291846_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nMore recently, the novella was purchased by Mike the Pike Productions, who played a big part in taking the project to Cinemax.  To handle the adaptation, script the pilot, and produce the show (should we get a greenlight), we've tapped a terrific talented young scriptwriter named KALINDA VAZQUEZ, whose previous credits include work on PRISON BREAK and ONCE UPON A TIME.  That was not an easy choice.  Cinemax and my agents set me up for meetings with close to a dozen different Tv writers, many of them very impressive, but Kalinda's take on the story and the characters blew me away.  She loves the story and the world, and really seems to get Willie and Randi, and her pitch to Cinemax was one of the most polished and professional I've ever heard.  I love her enthusiasm, and look forward to working with her.\r\n\r\n(And no, while I would have loved to write the script and run the show myself myself, that was never really in the cards.  I have this book to finish.  You know the one).\r\n\r\nSo... THE SKIN TRADE... coming to your TV set, er, eventually.  Maybe.  Howl for it.","ditemid":448800,"eventtime":"2015-10-13 17:37:00","props":{"current_mood":"jubilant","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"graphic novels, television, publications, horror","current_moodid":21,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1444965116,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Cinemax Orders SKIN TRADE Script http://goo.gl/f5jhdv","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":3,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.679007528067898]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1444603511}","revtime":1445539610},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-10-10 23:37:13","anum":32,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html","event_timestamp":1444757820,"reply_count":32,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109074112/36057088","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838048#t22838048","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838048#t22838048","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838048#t22838048","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_462330","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=554941329","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22838048,"talkid":89211,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838048#t22838048","upictitle":"Matt Stedman: pic#109074112","article":"Well, Cinemax is known for skin...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 11 2015, 00:28:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=554941329","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Matt Stedman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_462330","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=36057088&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Matt Stedman","ctime_ts":1444523322,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838560#t22838560","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838560#t22838560","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838560#t22838560","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"enayan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://enayan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22838560,"talkid":89213,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448800.html?thread=22838560#t22838560","upictitle":"enayan: pic#0","article":"Congratulations!

You were one of the guests, and I was at a late-night reading you did. NightVisions 5 wasn't out yet; you had the entire audience on the edge of our seats reading from \"The Skin Trade.\"<br /><br />Seriously. The novella starts out introducing mystery after mystery after mystery. The scheduled time for your reading drew near its end, yet if you'd stopped, the entire room would have had your head. Thankfully, you kept reading. Five minutes over, 10, and more. No one left. No one moved. Finally, the story reached a point where one of the big questions piled so high with all the others...one of them was answered. Probably the first part about how Joanie died, but that seems too early in the story for as long as the reading lasted, so maybe it was something later. But at last the audience knew *something* about what was going on, we knew enough to be able to wait a few more months for Night Visions to be published.<br /><br />It remains the best reading I've ever been to.
