{"itemid":339,"subject":"Climbing Liberty","event":"I climbed to the crown of the Statue of Liberty once.  \r\n\r\nOnce was enough, believe me.  The interior of the statue is stifling and hot, the winding metal steps are narrow and steep, and you're in a long line of people, with someone on the step ahead of you and someone on the step behind.  And once you reached the top, well, the inside of Lady Liberty's head is pretty cramped as well, and the windows are thick and pitted and do not actually offer that great a view.  \r\n\r\nIt's not an experience I am eager to repeat...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004hg4p/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004hg4p\" width=\"87\" height=\"141\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I am glad I did it, and I want others to have the chance to do it too.  Which is why I was heartened today by the announcement that the Obama administration is once again opening Lady Liberty to visitors.  \r\n\r\nGeorge W. Bush had, of course, closed the monument after 9/11 (visitors were still allowed on Liberty Island and could tour the museum in the statue's base, but were not allowed inside the lady herself), citing possible terrorist attacks as the reason.  Was that a danger?  To some extent, sure.  I have no doubt that Osama bin Laden would love to destroy the Statue of Liberty.  But closing the statue was not the answer.  It was, in fact, an act of cowardice, \"letting the terrorists win.\"  Being able to climb up inside the Statue of Liberty is not, of course, a fundamental right like freedom of speech or freedom of religion... but it was something cool that many generations of Americans had been able to enjoy, and having it taken away \"to keep us safe\" always galled me.\r\n\r\nAnd now it's back.  Hurrah, hurrah.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004kh7w/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004kh7w\" width=\"133\" height=\"129\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nMy mother, a child of another era, first visited Lady Liberty at a time when tourists were still allowed to climb up into her torch.  Now THAT would be cool.  Unlike the crown, the torch is open air, so the views would be spectacular.  But the torch was closed to the public long before I first got to Liberty Island in the 50s.  These days, I understand, no one goes up there but Superman... and the park rangers stationed at the monument, who rumor tells us like to climb up there to make out.","ditemid":86924,"eventtime":"2009-05-08 17:02:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":383,"taglist":"politics","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1243542550,"personifi_tags":"2:7,17:25,18:23,6:4,27:4,11:4,38:4,42:10,16:16,3:34,20:4,9:11,22:4,13:2,14:4,nterms:yes","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-05-08 23:23:45","anum":140,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html","event_timestamp":1241802120,"reply_count":45,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/44563219/588644","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?replyto=6108556","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108556#t6108556","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108556#t6108556","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108556#t6108556","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"zdraco","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://zdraco.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6108556,"talkid":23861,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108556#t6108556","upictitle":"Sean: amused Constantine","article":"park rangers make out?  surely you jest, kind sir!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"May 8 2009, 23:28:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://zdraco.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"zdraco","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"zdraco","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://zdraco.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"zdraco","ctime_ts":1241825313,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/12221551/751873","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?replyto=6108812","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108812#t6108812","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108812#t6108812","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108812#t6108812","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"elegantelbow","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://elegantelbow.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6108812,"talkid":23862,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/86924.html?thread=6108812#t6108812","upictitle":"elegantelbow: purple icon","article":"Totally off-topic, but amusing.<br /><br />I found a copy of <b>A Game of Thrones</b> on the <i>romance</i> shelf at the library.

I remember when, right before the war, Popular Photography showed a sign at one of the scenic views next to the Golden Gate Bridge saying no photographs could be taken:<br /><br /><blockquote>Restrictions against what photographers can photograph continue to tighten: now it's bridges. Shoot the Verrazano Narrows Bridge in New York and you might spend a night in the slammer (or at least have you camera or film taken away). How about that most photogenic of spans, the Golden Gate in San Fran? Uh-uh. The California Highway Patrol has recently stopped dozens of photographic offenders in mid-click. While there have been \"no pictures\" rules in the past, never have they been enforced as vigorously as they are now. \"use of camera prohibited; strictly enforced\" sign were posted in September on many New York City bridges. It's all about terrorism, of course: nervous police are concerned that some sleeper cell member might photograph structural details for a future attack.</blockquote><br /><br />I always wanted to buy a postcard of the bridge taken from that same vantage point and then drive there, hold up the postcard, and take a picture of that.

However, avoiding what you would otherwise do is giving in to the threats of bullies.  President Bush surrounded himself with a number of \"loyal\" advisers and may have been better off with different advice.   <br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the Jets, but I will be interested to see how they do with Sanchez.  Can they let him take his time and grow?  Or will they force him into the fire?
