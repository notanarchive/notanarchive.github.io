{"itemid":702,"subject":"Odds and Ends and More Odds","event":"We leave on Monday for Ireland.  Seems like I just got back from Australia.  Damn, but I'm tired.  And still not caught up on all the stuff that piled up here while I was travelling.  \r\n\r\nAh, well.  I knew the job was dangerous when I took it.\r\n\r\nGot a million things going down, on a number of fronts.  Let me touch on a few.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who like to hear me pontificate, there's a new podcast with me up on io9 where I talk with John Joseph Adams and David Barr Kirtly, holding forth on a wide variety of topics, including the HBO show, Wild Cards, fandom, my comic book projects, the anthologies I've been editing with Gardner Dozois, and of couse A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, even the infamous Meereenese knot.  You can give a listen at http://io9.com/5656513/  -- though I should mention that the interview was recorded last spring, and parts of it are already outdated.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, got some cool news from my editors at Bantam Spectra.  The mass market paperback of A GAME OF THRONES has just gone back to press for its 34th printing.  Which normally would not be worthy of note -- but as it happens, this new print run will push the paperback over the 1,000,000 copy mark.  A lovely round number, I think.  \r\n\r\nOh, and for Wild Cards fans, I should mention that Pat (wretched Cowboys fan that he is) of Pat's Fantasy Hotlist is doing one of his famous giveaways for the Tor reissue of the first volume in the series.  Check it out at http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2010/10/win-copy-of-wild-cards-1-edited-by.html   This new edition will include some extra added content: three brand new stories, never before published, by Carrie Vaughn, Michael Cassutt, and David D. Levine, plus all the text of the original 1987 edition.\r\n\r\nSONGS OF THE DYING EARTH, our Jack Vance tribute anthology, was a finalist for the British Fantasy Award and has been nominated for the World Fantasy Award.  If you missed the Subterranean limited edition and the Voyager trade hardcover, and have been waiting for a cheaper edition, wait no longer.  Harper has just released SONGS in a trade paperback:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ak0qy/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000ak0qy/s320x240\" width=\"157\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nPick up your copy from Amazon UK, or any other online UK bookshop.","ditemid":179778,"eventtime":"2010-10-06 14:37:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1287576745,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":398,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:7,18:5,6:3,11:2,23:5,16:3,3:50,25:2,19:5,4:39,9:13,21:5,nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1287839482},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-10-06 20:37:38","anum":66,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/179778.html","event_timestamp":1286375820,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103841605/10865290","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/179778.html?thread=11145538#t11145538","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/179778.html?thread=11145538#t11145538","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/179778.html?thread=11145538#t11145538","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/179778.html?thread=11145538#t11145538","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"philmophlegm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://philmophlegm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11145538,"talkid":43537,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/179778.html?thread=11145538#t11145538","upictitle":"philmophlegm: Dying Earth","article":"One million copies is astonishing - congratulations.
