While some choose to collaborate with the occupation and benefit from the new order, others rebel and suffer the consequences. After being separated from their son during the invasion, Will and Katie are willing to do whatever is necessary to be reunited with him. Thus, when the powerful Proxy Snyder (Peter Jacobson, &ldquo;House&rdquo;) offers Will a chance to get his son back if he will collaborate with the occupational government, Will and Katie find themselves faced with the toughest decision of their lives. They will have to go beyond whatever they thought possible to protect their family.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"679\"/>\r\n\r\n<b><span style=\"color:#fc0505;\">-THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE MINIONS OF FEVRE RIVER-</span></b>","ditemid":472898,"eventtime":"2016-02-15 17:55:00","props":{"current_mood":"predatory","taglist":"ryan j. condal, jean cocteau cinema, colony, usa, george r.r. martin","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Feb 17 00:55:28 2016]R [Wed Feb 17 00:55:29 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/699759035021590529 ","current_moodid":118,"commentalter":1455836201,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/699759035021590529","picture_keyword":"pic#125379682","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.613306113327274]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1455670549}","revtime":1455912183},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-02-17 00:55:24","anum":66,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html","event_timestamp":1455558900,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24016450#t24016450","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24016450#t24016450","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24016450#t24016450","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bart_leby","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bart-leby.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24016450,"talkid":93814,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24016450#t24016450","upictitle":"bart_leby: pic#0","article":"hey Ogre Jenni,<br />will the interview just be livestreamed or is there a chance to view it later on youtube too? would be nice for all fans living (and at that time sleeping) overseas.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"February 17 2016, 13:00:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bart-leby.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bart_leby","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bart_leby","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bart-leby.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bart_leby","ctime_ts":1455714054,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125901817/77505029","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24021058#t24021058","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24021058#t24021058","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24021058#t24021058","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3528608","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10206243168938291/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24021058,"talkid":93832,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472898.html?thread=24021058#t24021058","above":24016450,"upictitle":"Terri Schwartz: pic#125901817","article":"It will be live streamed via Periscope on IGN's account, and we'll post it on YouTube after!
