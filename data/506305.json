{"itemid":1977,"subject":"Odds, Ends, Fun Stuff","event":"Lots of gloom and doom around, but today I just want to burble about good stuff, the little things that make life worth living.   Books, movies, TV shows, friends, fun.\r\n\r\nLet me start with television.  How many of you have been watching HBO's big new drama WESTWORLD?  If not, you don't know what you're missing.  It's intriguing.  The old Yul Brynner / Michael Crichton movie was just the seed, this one goes way way way beyond that.  It's gorgeous to look at, and the writing and acting and directing are all first rate.  And hey, how many of you spotted Yul in last week's episode?\r\n\r\nI am also watching the two new time travel shows, TIMELESS and FREQUENCY, mainly because I am an SF geek who loves time travel yarns.   FREQUENCY is based on the film of the same title, one of the very best treatments of time paradoxes and the butterfly effect I've ever seen.  The show started out strong as well, though lately, I don't know, I worry that it's spinning its wheels.  I don't mind that they changed the present day character from a man to a woman, I only mind a little that they changed the past character from a fireman to a cop... but I hate that they lost the Amazin' Mets, one of the great parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, we hope to have a brand new official Wild Cards website up soon.   Watch this space for further details.  My crack staff of minions and ogres are revamping and updating the Jean Cocteau website as well.  \r\n\r\nWe had a great event with Emily St. John Mandel at the JCC on Monday night, before Black Tuesday.  What a delightful person, and what an amazing writer.   If you haven't read her STATION ELEVEN yet, grab yourself a signed copy from the JCC Bookshop, it's a brilliant book.  We also have autographed copies of her first three novels, which I mean to check out myself.\r\n\r\nThis weekend the JCC will host the magic of George Tovar.  Tickets available from our website.  We could all use more magic in our lives about now.\r\n\r\nI won't be able to see the show myself, alas, since I will be in Tucson for Tuscon, where I am Guest of Honor.  If you have a ticket, I will see you there.   If you don't, alas, I can't tell you where to get one; they have been sold out for months.  (This whole idea of SF cons selling out is strange to an old phan like me).  I have been cutting way back on my travel lately but Tuscon has been on my schedule for several years.  It's my last convention for 2016... though next month I will be flying to Mexico for the Guadalajara Book Fair, which has been booked even longer.  Tuscon should be fun; I am looking forward to spending some quality time with old friends, and to making some new ones.  And yes, I'll be signing books there.  Lots and lots of books.\r\n\r\nLatest fun read: the new Melinda Snodgrass novel THE HIGH GROUND, first volume of her space opera series.  Space cadets!  This is her best work yet, I think.  Looking forward to the next.  Next up is the new Lisa Tuttle, THE SOMNAMBULIST AND THE PSYCHIC THIEF, a Victorian supernatural mystery featuring the two characters she originally introduced in stories for a couple of my anthologies.","ditemid":506305,"eventtime":"2016-11-10 16:49:00","props":{"current_mood":"melancholy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, television and film","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Nov 10 23:49:04 2016]R [Thu Nov 10 23:49:05 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/796862272731639809 ","current_moodid":39,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1478885586,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/796862272731639809","picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.670559957129799]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1478821756}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1977?v=1478885619","revtime":1478885617},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-10 23:49:03","anum":193,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html","event_timestamp":1478796540,"reply_count":46,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126685948/78881657","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25262529#t25262529","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25262529#t25262529","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25262529#t25262529","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3868483","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/dinatale_amanda","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25262529,"talkid":98681,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25262529#t25262529","article":"How in the world do you keep up with everything?

In July I moved from LA to New Mexico to take in the \"energy\" that fueled the greatest story of all time, your epic in progress, as I write my own little thing.<br />And now, as soon as I get a visa, I'm outta this continent to a remote and hopefully safer sector of the globe. Dont want to leave, but I can't shake the knowing that things will get unpredictable, dangerous, violent, explosive. We're now having to trust an Aerys II/Joffrey combo to defend us. Everything in his character suggests he will be the danger. Even most smart people against him dont seem to see the existential threat here that goes beyond social/bigotry stuff. We're handing the most powerful military and arsenal ever to an evil moronic game show host who's never filled a tank of gas or been in a Walmart or even locker room. He will not resist exercising \"tremendous\" power earned through being a maniacal asshole, and seems to think it will be expected of him. I pray, pray, pray it will not get to this.<br />So, shit's bad, anyone with half a brain can tell. But people like you that I admire, who have strived and worked on creating good, being good for the world- its uplifting to see that even in this darkness, good is still there, and I'm not alone, and that I can keep trying.

Hope she posts on LJ again soon, although she's always sporadic about that!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 11 2016, 03:25:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thefirstalicat.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thefirstalicat","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thefirstalicat","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thefirstalicat.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thefirstalicat","ctime_ts":1478834722,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126852436/79289281","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270465#t25270465","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270465#t25270465","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270465#t25270465","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3889139","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1385574881455425/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25270465,"talkid":98712,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270465#t25270465","upictitle":"Mark L Garrigus: pic#126852436","article":"Thank you for your pop culture contributions and for being a positive person.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 11 2016, 03:41:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Thank you George","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1385574881455425/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Mark L Garrigus","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3889139","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=79289281&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Mark L Garrigus","ctime_ts":1478835670,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270721#t25270721","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270721#t25270721","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270721#t25270721","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3453745","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/+BarFarer","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25270721,"talkid":98713,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25270721#t25270721","upictitle":"Bar Farer: pic#0","article":"I read Station Eleven and I very much enjoyed it, I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed it as well.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 11 2016, 03:51:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Station Eleven","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/+BarFarer","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Bar Farer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3453745","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77255915&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Bar Farer","ctime_ts":1478836303,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/101252367/578090","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25271233#t25271233","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25271233#t25271233","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25271233#t25271233","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bungeebot","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25271233,"talkid":98715,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506305.html?thread=25271233#t25271233","upictitle":"Zack: knytt stories bird","article":"It's not as good as Game Of Thrones... comparatively GOT, as an HBO show, is down-to-earth and relatable. That's one of the many things that makes it a fantastic TV show. Westworld on the other hand is intriguing but nebulous - we constantly have more questions than answers. But you're right, Westworld is still a great show.<br /><br />As for the doom and gloom, for some reason I've become obsessed with a certain sentiment of your character Maggy The Frog, specifically: \"Gold shall be his crown... and gold... his shroud!!\"  :)<br /><br />Seriously though, it's a scary time, but it will build character in all of us, young and old. We just have to remember to look out for each other, and let Love rule over every other emotion. Bottomline: I'm optimistic. I hope everyone can find room in his/her heart for optimism in this scary time in history.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 11 2016, 04:25:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Westworld","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bungeebot","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bungeebot","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bungeebot","ctime_ts":1478838346,"tracked":0}]}
