To tell the truth, I don't recall what I said.  Maybe it wasn't important.\r\n\r\nOh, wait... I did say something about A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS debuting high on the bestseller lists in both the UK and the US... and how gorgeous the Gary Gianni artwork was, what an absolutely lovely volume... oh, and what a hoot it was when A GAME OF THRONES ascended briefly to #1 on the NEW YORK TIMES mass market list.  Quite a feat for a book originally published in 1996.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that was some of my good stuff in 2015.\r\n\r\n(And I have the nagging feeling maybe I've even forgotten a publication or two in this retelling.  Which I did not do first time around.
