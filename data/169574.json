{"itemid":662,"subject":"A Few Odds, Some Ends","event":"Nightmarish day yesterday.  The computer virus that we've been battling for weeks... often hammering it down, but never entirely eradicating it... upsurged again, and totally messed my Windows machine, so Ty had to spend the whole day dealing with it, and I could never get on line to read my emails.\r\n\r\nHe was finally successful, so I'm back in business.  In fact, the computer is running better than it has for weeks.  Maybe Ty has finally slain the beast.  But I won't celebrate too soon.\r\n\r\nOf course, just one single day away from my email meant that I had more than a hundred letters in my inbox when I did get back on this morning.  ONE DAY!  Aieeee....\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, I see that Mo Ryan broke the Charles Dance casting while I was in computer hell.  Yay, Mo.  I'm very pleased by this one, and will post more about it later.  Got a couple other castings I should talk about as well... but it has dawned on me that there's no way I can talk about them ALL.  Not if I want to do anything else.  There are just so many.\r\n\r\nThe first week of shooting in Belfast went well, I hear, although the weather screwed with them a bit and pretty much confined them to the Paint Hall.  Wish I could have been there.\r\n\r\nI missed the San Diego Comicon as well, as previously posted.  But I did have a presence.  IDW announced the DOORWAYS comic, as below... and Bantam Specta debuted the gorgeous new 2011 Ice & Fire calendar, with its stunning Ted Nasmith art.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0009bbt4/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0009bbt4/s320x240\" width=\"244\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe calendar is now officially on sale and available, at all good bookstores that sell calendars.  Also on Amazon.  And they are shipping now.  People are already receiving their calendars.  Yes, we thought we would try something new this time, like actually sending people the calendars that they order.  I hope you like this innovation.  (This is not an invitation to rehash the mess we had with the 2009 calendar.  That horse is dead.  We know, we know.  Believe me, we know).\r\n\r\nOh, and I also wanted to mention LIGHTSPEED, a new on-line SF magazine edited by the talented John Joseph Adams.  Their current issue reprints a story by some Martin guy from the dawn of time, called \"... for a single yesterday.\"  You can read it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/for-a-single-yesterday/\r\n\r\nThe way LIGHTSPEED works, JJA informs me, \"you can read all of our content for free, but it's serialized on the website throughout the month, one story and one article per week. If you want to read the week 4 story now--or if you just want it in convenient downloadable formats--you can just buy the ebook version.\"\r\n\r\nSo: electronic magazines.  Wave of the future.  \r\n\r\nFinally, might mention that I finished a chapter of the DANCE today.  I had one last chapter about this particular character -- I will call him Fred -- to finish, and then I am done with him for the book.  Of course, in the writing, it turned into three chapters.  So I finished a Fred chapter a week ago, and a Fred chapter an hour ago, and yet I STILL have one Fred chapter to finish.  Sigh.  The horizon recedes continuously before me.\r\n\r\nTime to go eat supper.  Bye.","ditemid":169574,"eventtime":"2010-07-30 20:02:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":564,"taglist":"writing, a dance with dragons, calendar","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1292888675,"personifi_tags":"18:9,45:5,8:11,10:5,23:5,42:7,1:11,3:29,25:3,4:7,20:5,9:5,21:3,22:5,13:5,nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-07-31 02:02:26","anum":102,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html","event_timestamp":1280520120,"reply_count":45,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?replyto=10803302","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10803302#t10803302","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10803302#t10803302","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10803302#t10803302","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"justynv","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://justynv.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10803302,"talkid":42200,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10803302#t10803302","upictitle":"justynv: pic#0","article":"George, I'm both ecstatic and writhing in anxiety for this book!

Finally a co-worker clued me into Malwarebytes.  They have a version that you can download and run for free, and I've never seen a virus it couldn't handle.  It finds everything from suspicious cookies in your web browser's cache to malicious processes that are practically impossible to track by virtue of existing exclusively in memory.  In the worst case Ty will have wasted 45 minutes or so downloading the product and running a full scan.  The more likely scenario, I think, is that you finally get rid of the beast and eliminate the distraction.<br /><br />Ty might even consider upgrading to the full-featured version that actually helps prevent infection, as opposed to cleaning up after the fact.  It's my favorite anti-virus program to date because it's very conservative with computer resources unlike most modern resource-hungry anti-virus programs that behave as badly as viruses.  The licensed version of Malwarebytes only requires a one-time fee, whereas most anti-virus programs use subscription based pricing models.  <br /><br />First you need to get rid of the virus, and I haven't seen Malwarebytes fail in the past year that I've had it.  Their web site is at www.malwarebytes.org.  I promise I don't work for them or know anyone who does :)  In any case I hope you're able to keep your computer happy.

It cleans your system completely.<br /><br />If you're looking for another free alternativ to block malware, Microsoft Security Essentials is also quite good. It uses very few resources and so far has a good track record in detecting, blocking and removing threats.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","below":10810982,"ctime":"July 31 2010, 11:32:53 UTC","parent":10807654,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Did Ty try Malwarebytes?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://olevaar.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"olevaar","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"olevaar","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://olevaar.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"olevaar","ctime_ts":1280575973,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10810982#t10810982","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10810982#t10810982","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10810982#t10810982","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jretan","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jretan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10810982,"talkid":42230,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10810982#t10810982","above":10810470,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","below":10811494,"parent":10807654,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Did Ty try Malwarebytes?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jretan.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jretan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jretan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jretan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jretan","ctime_ts":1280581445,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10807654#t10807654","name":"expand","title":"More"}],"parent":10807654,"moreclass":"width","data":"10811494:10813286","moreusers":1,"level":2,"margin":30,"type":"more","more":4,"ljusers":[{"journal_url":"http://angelchrome.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"angelchrome","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"angelchrome","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://angelchrome.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0},{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0},{"journal_url":"http://bardofawen.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bardofawen","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bardofawen","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bardofawen.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"touched":1281078546},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?replyto=10808166","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10808166#t10808166","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10808166#t10808166","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10808166#t10808166","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"entalan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://entalan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10808166,"talkid":42219,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169574.html?thread=10808166#t10808166","upictitle":"entalan: pic#0","article":"I just made an account to tell you that the short story you linked to and wrote was absolutely brilliant.
