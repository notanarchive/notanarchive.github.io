{"itemid":1060,"subject":"Game of Thrones MMORPG","event":"Yes, Virginia, it's true... there is going to be a GAME OF THRONES MMORPG.  And that's in addition to the two previously announced videogames from Cyanide, the real-time strategy game GENESIS and the forthcoming Cyanide RPG.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming Game of Thrones MMORPG is currently being developed by BigPoint (http://www.bigpoint.com/) in collaboration with HBO.  BigPoint is already one of the premier developers of online games, including Battlestar Galactica Online, and Lord of Ultima.  Now, in partnership with HBO, and based on their award winning television series, BigPoint is working on a Massively Multiplayer Online version of Game of Thrones.\r\n\r\nVenture Beat (http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/29/bigpoint-unveils-game-of-thrones-online-game-based-on-hbo-series-exclusive/) got an early look at the game, including a few screenshots and some discussion about the focus of game play, noting that both combat and politics will be vital to the players success.\r\n\r\nTo sign up for updates on the game, go to their official Game of Thrones website (http://gameofthronesmmo.com/).","ditemid":271477,"eventtime":"2012-03-01 15:22:00","props":{"current_location":"still at home","taglist":"videogame, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1331913893,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":3,"revtime":1332012829},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-03-01 22:22:04","anum":117,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html","event_timestamp":1330615320,"reply_count":40,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/15848837/1530444","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578485#t15578485","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578485#t15578485","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578485#t15578485","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578485#t15578485","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bastun_ie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15578485,"talkid":60853,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578485#t15578485","upictitle":"bastun: Gaming Smeagol","article":"Oh-oh... a GoT game that isn't from Cyanide (Genesis was a huge disappointment)...

This led to a flavourless game where the \"Great Lord\" of House X would marry a  \"Lady\" who would give birth to an \"Heir\" - all of them unnamed.  As a result we got to play, at best, in a pre-ASOIAF Westeros with some of the Houses, and couldn't get a War of Five Kings map or scenario.<br /><br />Will you lift this restriction for the MMO so we can play in the Westeros of the time of the books?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 2 2012, 00:32:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bastun_ie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bastun_ie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bastun_ie","ctime_ts":1330648338,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578741#t15578741","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578741#t15578741","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578741#t15578741","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578741#t15578741","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15578741,"talkid":60854,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15578741#t15578741","above":15578485,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Bethesda's technology is so realistic that sometimes...it's more real than real.<br /><br />Another game studio is Eidos...their recent release of Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a significant AAA title.  They also make such hits like Batman: Arkham Asylum, and now working on a new Tomb Raider and Thief game which are forcast to be epic successes.<br /><br />To be honest, as someone who plays about 40 hours of games each week, I'd rather read one of your books than play a B game even if it's set in the world of Ice & Fire.

Being a video game developer, I am extremely disappointed in this choice. The games this company pump out are scams. They lure you in, claiming the game is \"free to play.\" That's a lie. The games are free to lose, pay to win. It's sad seeing your masterpiece be turned into a cash cow and milked for all it's worth.

The game company Koei has been mining it for 20 years now with a couple different series of games, the very popular (but inferior IMHO) Dynasty Warriors, and the more Niche (but amazing) Romance of the Three Kingdoms which is spawning its 12th game soon. Koei has done similar things with other historical periods, such as Fuedal Japan, the world conquest of Genghis Khan and the American Revolution.

My initial feeling is that they will George's and HBO's GoT popularity to take in a quick buck.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 4 2012, 21:15:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1330895728,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15631989#t15631989","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15631989#t15631989","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15631989#t15631989","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"the12judge","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://the12judge.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15631989,"talkid":61062,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15631989#t15631989","upictitle":"the12judge: pic#88319714","article":"I had hoped for a better mmorpg than what Bigpoint (ugh) is doing... \"a browser-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game.\"  Big-time suck.

the major house would have alliances and wars, so you (and all other players) would have to fight the battles for those houses.<br /><br />major npc forces of the seven houses would be marked on the map and players would travel around the westoros with that information in mind - you could join up with the main forces, or perhaps take your small army behind enemy lines etc.<br /><br />8) non combat gameplay would revolve around crafting and politics (you would try to find a good match for your females or your males between houses of other players, or if the reputation with medium houses is high enough - perhaps you could wed a mormont or cerwyn or...)<br /><br />9) fighting wars would earn you some loot (unless you have defeats :P) and reputation, good with those that you fight for, and bad with those you fight against (and then traveling during peace time in the faction that does not like you would still be dangerous)<br /><br />10) there has to be some kind of organized pvp and that would be done by various tournaments<br /><br />..<br />X) and then expansions would come: \"Beyond the Wall\", \"Essos\"...<br /><br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />as you can see - i like to dream (that was a very short version of what i've dreamed).<br /><br />so i was excided for a brief moment when i saw the title... and then i was solely disappointed; oh well, i still have my imagination :-)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 12 2012, 13:44:30 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001210569288","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Fox Nemhauser","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1098940","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=47509449&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Fox Nemhauser","ctime_ts":1331559870,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15658357#t15658357","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15658357#t15658357","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15658357#t15658357","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thefall3n1","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thefall3n1.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15658357,"talkid":61165,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15658357#t15658357","upictitle":"thefall3n1: pic#0","article":"can't wait,hope it will be f2p!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 13 2012, 18:23:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"good","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thefall3n1.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thefall3n1","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thefall3n1","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thefall3n1.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thefall3n1","ctime_ts":1331663022,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116485684/47578577","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15671925#t15671925","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15671925#t15671925","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15671925#t15671925","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1106271","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/Hannes665","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15671925,"talkid":61218,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/271477.html?thread=15671925#t15671925","upictitle":"Hannes risson: pic#116485684","article":"Hi, just wanted to say congrats on the Game of Thrones HBO series.
