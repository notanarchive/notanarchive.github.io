{"itemid":1675,"subject":"More Signed Books","event":"Speaking of signing books... as I was in the post below...\r\n\r\nFor all of you who are enjoying OUTLANDER, the marvelous adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's time travel novels that just finished its first season on STARZ... well, the show is terrific, but the books are even better (as is so often the case), and we have AUTOGRAPHED COPIES of the whole Outlander series and the 'Lord John' spinoff books as well available via mail order from the Jean Cocteau Bookshop \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/252611/252611_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/252783/252783_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/253132/253132_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/253345/253345_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nIf you haven't been watching OUTLANDER, you're missing a terrific TV series.  Gorgeous to look at, and the performances by the three leads are terrific.  Tobias Menzies, who played Brutus on HBO's ROME and Edmure Tully on GAME OF THRONES, is especially noteworthy in a double role.  (I just hope we'll be able to get him back, if and when D&D decide to return to the riverlands).\r\n\r\n(OUTLANDER 'feels' like a cross of historical fiction and romantic adventure, but the time travel element definitely qualifies it as SF, or at least fantasy, so it's a show worth remembering next year when Hugo nomination time comes round again).\r\n\r\nOUTLANDER films in Scotland, GAME OF THRONES primarily in Northern Ireland.  Between the two shows, I doubt there's a single major actor in the British Isles we haven't used yet.  Great casts.  Diana got sixteen episodes for one novel, two eight-episode half-seasons, which had me gnashing my teeth in envy... until I remembered that OUTLANDER has no dragons, direwolves, or ice zombies, and so far no major battles either.  Though, if I recall my history, that will be coming... the battles, that is, not the dragons.\r\n\r\nI might also mention WOLF HALL, another excellent TV series from the UK based on novels, in this case on Hilary Mantel's novel of the same name and its sequel.  Makes an interesting contrast with THE TUDORS series that Showtime ran a couple of years ago.  We do not, alas, have signed copies of WOLF HALL available, since Hilary Mantel has never visited Santa Fe...\r\n\r\n... but we do have the OUTLANDER books.  While they last.  And lots more besides.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jeancocteaubooks.com/","ditemid":428946,"eventtime":"2015-06-09 22:22:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, television, signed books","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1434069285,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"More Signed Books http://goo.gl/tnozMH","picture_keyword":"scotland","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.622086760623915]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1433716817}","revtime":1434968232},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-06-07 22:39:34","anum":146,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428946.html","event_timestamp":1433888520,"reply_count":28,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/50471337/164303","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428946.html?thread=21698450#t21698450","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428946.html?thread=21698450#t21698450","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428946.html?thread=21698450#t21698450","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"savatage","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://savatage.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21698450,"talkid":84759,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428946.html?thread=21698450#t21698450","upictitle":"ryan, diesel, ty johnson, dirk vargas, ect.. ect..: Syd","article":"I hope to see Tobias back as well, because the siege of Riverrun was one of my favorite chapters in Feast for Crows.

They give time for the characters and setting to breathe even though sometimes it slows down the pace of the plot. But I can honestly say that it never gets boring. Everything seems to be in context despite the improbability of so much happening to one woman all the time. Plus, it's beautifully filmed with brilliant acting all around. Particularly Tobias Menzies. Wow.<br /><br />I haven't watched the Wolf Hall adaptation yet because I'm still reading Bring Up the Bodies. I have to say though that despite knowing most of the story and how it ends, it never ever gets boring. Wolf Hall in particular is spectacular. The Tudors show was glamorous but rather disappointing most of the time. If it hadn't been for Sam Neill (who is now the voice of Wolsey in my head) or Maria Doyle Kennedy or Jeremy Northam,they were the saving grace for serious viewers. But a decent effort nonetheless. <br /><br />As for the Riverlands plot on the show, there doesn't seem to be any indication of that happening at all.
