{"itemid":1816,"subject":"Last Year (Writing, Editing, Producing)","event":"I do other things besides A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE.\r\n\r\nNothing new about that.  Since the very start of my career, in the early 1970s, I've always tried to keep several balls in the air.  Sometimes one will plunk you in the head, to be sure, but it keeps life from getting dull.\r\n\r\nMy editing wound down a little in 2015.  As much as I would like to do some more anthologies like ROGUES and OLD VENUS with Gardner Dozois, they were taking more of my time than I was comfortable with, given my other commitments.  So Gardner is going on ahead solo with several exciting new anthology projects, but our team titles will need to wait.  Apologies to all of you who were waiting for OLD URANUS.  \r\n\r\nWild Cards is another matter.  Wild Cards is in my blood, and I plan to continue with those books as long as someone will keep buying them.  (And I desperately want to write more Wild Cards stories of my own, instead of just editing, but I don't have time for that either).  We delivered HIGH STAKES last year -- the copyedited manuscript is on my desk as I type, waiting to be reviewed -- and have signed with Tor for three more originals.  Meanwhile, the reissues continue, and foreign publishers are picking up the series all over the world.  We also have three Wild Cards graphic novels in the pipeline.  Originals, not adaptations.  The scripts are in -- one from Carrie Vaughn, one from Melinda M. Snodgrass, one from the team of Kevin Andrew Murphy and John Jos. Miller -- and the artists are hard at work on the pencils.  They should be something.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the Hollywood front, I have three shows in various stages of development under the aegis of my overall deal with HBO.  There's CAPTAIN COSMOS for HBO (scripted by Michael Cassutt), there's SKIN TRADE for Cinemax (to be scripted by Kalinda Vasquez), and there's a third project in the very early stages that I am not allowed to talk about yet.  There's also WILD CARDS, but that's at a different studio and I am not involved with it, except to license rights, sign the check, and distribute funds to my writers.  Oh, and on the movie side, we seem to be moving toward production on IN THE LOST LANDS, an adaptation of three of my old stories.\r\n\r\nLast year I also formed Kill Van Kull Productions, to develop and produce a series of low budget short films (twenty to thirty minutes long) of some classic SF short stories.  Can't say any more than that just now, but I will keep you posted as plans proceed.  \r\n\r\nI also turned down several interesting and potentially lucrative projects, on both the publishing and television/ film sides.  Some of it was stuff I would love to do, but there's just not enough time.  I like to juggle, but you do need to keep the number of balls down.\r\n\r\nSo... plenty on my plate.  Keep your fingers crossed, though, especially for the television and film projects.  In Hollywood, nothing is ever real till shooting starts, and sometimes not even then.  Remember William Goldman's wisdom: nobody knows anything.","ditemid":464984,"eventtime":"2016-01-01 19:13:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, anthologies, hbo, editing","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Jan  2 02:13:15 2016]R [Sat Jan  2 02:13:17 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683108771611070464 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1452215113,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683108771611070464","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.633234707548096]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451700847}","revtime":1452493996},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-02 02:13:12","anum":88,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464984.html","event_timestamp":1451675580,"reply_count":79,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125733669/77255457","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464984.html?thread=23457880#t23457880","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464984.html?thread=23457880#t23457880","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464984.html?thread=23457880#t23457880","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464984.html?thread=23457880#t23457880","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3453610","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1187145814652291/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23457880,"talkid":91632,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464984.html?thread=23457880#t23457880","upictitle":"Nathaniel Brumley: pic#125733669","article":"Were you offered anything telating to Shannara?

Keeps my interests, well, interesting. I love ASOIAF immensely and recently started your <u>Thousand Worlds</u> stories and am really blown away at the Universive you've created. I just finished Greywater Watch and the scientists reminded me of 'The Institute' from \"Fallout 4\". I have suggested these to my friends because they are a great read. I'm not sure if anybody has ever asked you this, but is \"The Known World\" (Planet Westeros/Essos/Lands of Always Winter is on) part of the same Universe as these short stories/novels like Dying Light and Greywater Watch? It seems like it definitely could be (different galaxy?).<br /><br />Do you have plans to put these stories into an Anthology?  That would be great (with art of course!) especially if they are meant to be read in a certain order.

Pardon my French, but I believe it was Shakespeare who said \"Hey man, do that shit up.\" You've taken us to hundreds of worlds, I think it fair you get to explore this one. <br />Forgive us, George(if I may be so informal), for we are the children of Summer; and (The Winds of)Winter is coming, and no faster for all the bitching and moaning. <br />I've taken advantage of the wait by discovering the Wild Cards universe, as well as 1000 worlds (credit Preston Jacobs for this). I may relate to Croyd Crenson more than any other character in your works. Thank you for him and Tyrion and Dirk and everything you've given us! Can't wait for Diddy Kong to be complete!
