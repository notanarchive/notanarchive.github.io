If you have mathematical equations of rune power and mana potential and elemental affinity, what's magical about that at all? It's almost a science.<br /><br />Now I agree with your deus ex machina point to an extent. If say all of the remaining Starks other than Rickon were killed, which triggered the power of the lone wolf that has always existed in the Stark blood, and Rickon transforms into a flying wolf-dragon monster, I think that would be crossing the line a little bit. <br /><br />However, thus far the magic in A Song of Ice and Fire has been relatively low key, and while mysterious, not overly fantastical. What could be seen as the most glaring incident of this to me at least (Melisandre's shadow baby's murder of Renly) has proved to be as the series continues something that comes with a price. Melisandre is probably the most magic reliant character thus far, but now we are starting to see her powers are limited and dangerous, which makes it that much more magical since the stakes are raised.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"October 24 2011, 12:02:28 UTC","parent":14874592,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: I disagree with you on something","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://stark-winter.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"stark_winter","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"stark_winter","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://stark-winter.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"stark_winter","ctime_ts":1319457748,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/244960.html?thread=14894816#t14894816","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/244960.html?thread=14894816#t14894816","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/244960.html?thread=14894816#t14894816","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"pulvatory","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://pulvatory.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14894816,"talkid":58182,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/244960.html?thread=14894816#t14894816","above":14878432,"upictitle":"pulvatory: pic#0","article":"You know, I never realized that people enjoy magic being this arcane mythical thing. Characters in the (admittedly few) fantasy books I've read seem to be always studying it and experimenting with it; it's part of their world, and so - as far as they are concerned - magic <i>is</i> science. I'm surprised there aren't many writers who treat it as such. I suppose most view it as a symbolic or thematic thing (like Philip Pullman and \"His Dark Materials\"'s treatment of Dust).<br /><br />But anyway, I'm personally hoping your last point is right, and that any dead characters coming back to life find themselves realizing it would have been much, much better to stay dead. Low key magic works better for ASOIAF (IMO - sorry, GRRM, if you disagree, but it's just this dumb person's opinion) than, I dunno, world-saving princes on dragons.
