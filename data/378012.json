Corey, they won the Locus Award for Best SF Novel of the year.&nbsp; (Would that ABADDON&#39;S GATE was on the Hugo ballot as well).&nbsp; And of course, congrats to my co-editor Gardner Dozois, and our amazing lineup of writers, who made the anthology the delight that it is.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t checked out OLD MARS yet, you missed at lot.\r\n\r\n((And for what it&#39;s worth, OLD VENUS will be even better)).\r\n\r\nNext thing, the nominees for this year&#39;s World Fantasy Award were announced.&nbsp; OLD MARS wasn&#39;t eligible, being science fiction and all... but DANGEROUS WOMEN, the big crossgenre anthology that Gardner and I released last summer, is one of the finalists for Best Anthology (against some mighty stiff competition, I might add).\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"91EWTSOg1IL._SL1500_\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/209267/209267_300.jpg\" title=\"91EWTSOg1IL._SL1500_\" />\r\n\r\nYou can check out the full list of Wold Fantasy Award nominees here:\r\nhttp://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/\r\n\r\nTo round out the triptych, in the midst of all this recognition for the books that Gargy and I did last year, our newest anthology, ROGUES, hit the shelves from coast and coast... and debuted at #7 on the NEW YORK TIMES Bestseller List.&nbsp; No, not the anthology bestseller list, or the SF/ fantasy bestseller list, but the bestseller list for <b><i>ALL HARDCOVER FICTION</i></b>.&nbsp; Which is pretty damned extraordinary for an anthology.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-07-06/hardcover-fiction/list.html\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Rogues comp A March 17 lo res\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/209534/209534_300.jpg\" title=\"Rogues comp A March 17 lo res\" />\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, it was a hell of a month.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to the LOCUS voters, the World Fantasy Con members and judges, and all the readers who snatched up ROGUES.\r\n\r\nI love doing anthologies, and introducing great stories and new writers to my fans.&nbsp; It&#39;s great to see the books being so well received.","ditemid":378012,"eventtime":"2014-07-17 17:06:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"locus awards, anthologies, world fantasy convention, awards, bestseller lists","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1406055563,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1409076688},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-07-17 23:05:35","anum":156,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378012.html","event_timestamp":1405616760,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378012.html?thread=19354524#t19354524","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378012.html?thread=19354524#t19354524","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378012.html?thread=19354524#t19354524","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2624796","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/108933231591175622250","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19354524,"talkid":75603,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378012.html?thread=19354524#t19354524","upictitle":"Austin Cornell: pic#0","article":"That's great!

There are times when three alternate versions of a romantic entanglement are given -- for example, why Daemon ultimately left King's Landing again (if we believe all three rival accounts, he at one time or another had sex with Alicent Hightower, was found abed with Rhaenyra, Rhaenyra was having threesomes with Laenor Velayron *and* Harwin Strong, Rhaenyra fellated half the nobles in King's Landing, etc. etc.)<br /><br />Now I realize that this ties into the whole \"Third person POV\" thing that the main novels use:  no one really knows objectively what happened, and as in real history, we have rival reports.  <br /><br />But the question is...do *you* know, and it's just a secret you're taking to your grave?  Or is there, objectively, no answer?<br /><br />What really pissed me off about Battlestar Galactica's later seasons is when Ron Moore - a writer I used to deeply respect - eventually had to admit that he was making up the entire thing as he went along:  there was never a \"Cylon Plan\".  It was in the opening credits, at EVERY convention panel people would ask \"is there a Cylon Plan?\" and he's say \"of course there is\"...though his hidden caveat was \"of course there's a Cylon Plan...I just haven't come up with what it is yet!\" (ultimately the man had no deep seated narrative views on \"God did it\", it was just a deus ex machina to slap out an \"ending\" of a sort while running out the studio door shouting \"no backsies!\"<br /><br />In contrast, you know who Jon Snow's mother is, and have known since the first book - objectively there is an answer, you just haven't revealed it yet.  <br /><br />Rhaenyra is such an intriguing character because her actual personality is clouded behind so much rival propaganda and salacious gossip.  I think that was sort of the point - are we dealing with the Mushroom/smallfolk/gossip version of Rhaenyra?  The Greens' biased views of Rhaenyra?  (She couldn't cut her legs on the Iron Throne if she was *wearing armor* at the time).  <br /><br />So objectively, do YOU know which of the rival stories about Rhaenyra is true?  Or is it an intentional unsolved mystery?  Or is one of them true, but you're taking the secret to your grave?  (similar to how we may never know if Bran the Builder really did built the Wall AND Winterfell AND Storm's End, or if the myths just got confused).  Or other questions, like who killed Harwin Strong?  Alicent?  Larys?  Viserys I?  Or who killed Laenor Velaryon?  Why did Criston Cole ultimately scorn Rhaenyra?  It's in a sort of state of quantum flux at the moment.  <br /><br />Will the proposed \"Fire and Blood\" anthology ever provide answers about this?  By my count if you wrote 80,000 words on the Dance of the Dragons, taken together the Rogue Prince and the Princess and the Queen only give us about half of the whole material.

I mean unless you get into the emotions of the people and try to present it like something that would really happen. Like, one of the main fascinations of science fiction to me has always been the aliens. What other fields can you get into a totally alien mind, and play with all of these different worlds and social setups. One of the really great stories on alien mentality was “Saurian Valedictory” but I've forgotten who wrote it.<br /><br /> HAMILTON:  Norman something-or-other was his name. It was in Tremaine's Astounding. It was a brilliant achievement and nobody seems to have heard of it, or him. It was an attempt to depict a reptilian civilization before Man. It succeeded triumphantly; the values were all so different, the psychology. I've been trying to reprint that for years. I tried to get August Derleth to reprint it, but... I think I'm the only one who likes it.<br /><br /> BRACKETT:  No you're not.
