{"itemid":1366,"subject":"Winter Is Coming...","event":"... to Santa Fe, and the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\nThe fourth season of GAME OF THRONES is only a few months away.&nbsp; Tyrion, Jon, Arya, Sansa, the Hound, Joffrey, Cersei, Jaime, Brienne, Bronn, Sam, Daenerys, and all the rest of the characters you love or hate will be returning to your TV screens... oh, along about late March or early April, I&#39;d say.&nbsp; So what time could be better to refresh yourselves on the first three seasons of the show?\r\n\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"389\" />\r\n\r\nSo, by special arrangement with HBO, the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe will be presenting a GAME OF THRONES retrospective.&nbsp; New Mexicans -- and lucky tourists passing through at the right time -- will have a chance to see the show the way only VIPs and cast members and critics have ever seen it before, at private screenings and premieres -- on the big screen at a movie theatre.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"390\" />\r\n\r\nStarting on Monday, January 6, and continuing through late March, the Cocteau will be presenting weekly screenings of GAME OF THRONES, in order.&nbsp; Some weeks we&#39;ll show two episodes, some weeks three. &nbsp; I expect to be on hand personally for many of the screenings (though, <b>PLEASE NOTE</b>, probably not all), to introduce the episodes beforehand, answer questions afterward, and sign a few books as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it may be we will have some other special guests as well, either in person or via Skype.&nbsp; Can&#39;t promise anything as of yet, but we&#39;re working on it.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"391\" />\r\n\r\nOur official screening schedule looks like this:\r\n\r\n<b><big><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\">Monday, J<font face=\"Arial\">anuary 6</font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
