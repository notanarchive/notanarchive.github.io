{"itemid":815,"subject":"Back at the Holdfast","event":"Returned home last night from my short visit to LA, where I attended a private screening of the first two episodes of GAME OF THRONES, made a surprise visit to the food truck in Venice, enjoyed a great celebratory dinner with Dan and David at the Palm (where we first met, lo these many years ago), called on Justin Sweet in his Yorba Linda studio and saw some gorgeous roughs of the artwork he'll be doing for the forthcoming WORLD OF ICE & FIRE concordance, met with Mark Newbauer of Mike the Pike Productions about their on-going SKIN TRADE film project, and even enjoyed a great lunch with old friend Ron Perlman, from my days on BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  It was an amazing few days, if insanely busy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f71cy/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f71cy/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe first two episodes look spectacular, I think, especially when seen on the big screen at CAA.  Cinematic quality.  (I have a new 55 inch TV set being installed this week, and now I'm afraid that it's too small)  These were the first complete episodes I've seen, and I loved them.  Yes, there are changes from the books, and of course there are things missing -- lines of dialogue, bits of business, scenes -- but without twice or thrice the running time, there was no way to get EVERYTHING in.  The story is there, that's the important thing.  Fans who know the books inside and out may miss certain things, sure, but the vast majority of viewers, those who have never read the novels, should do just fine.  \r\n\r\nMy hat is off to David and Dan and the team they put together.  They've done an amazing job. \r\n\r\nOh, and HBO has released a new trailer.  Herewith, \"Poison.\"\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"166\"/>","ditemid":208713,"eventtime":"2011-04-10 15:07:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","commentalter":1302748276,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":290,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"6:4,45:2,10:2,11:4,42:4,3:51,24:4,25:4,5:9,4:30,9:9,21:6,13:4,14:4,nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1302804015},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-04-10 21:11:03","anum":73,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html","event_timestamp":1302448020,"reply_count":43,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12895049#t12895049","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12895049#t12895049","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12895049#t12895049","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"metalgoddessamb","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://metalgoddessamb.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12895049,"talkid":50371,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12895049#t12895049","upictitle":"metalgoddessamb: pic#57201929","article":"Did you talk about Sons Of Anarchy with Ron?

HBO has the \"HBO Go\" which you can view HBO content on... but that requires one to have an HBO subscription as well.  The only thing you can hope for as a potential alternative, is if HBO changes its Go model and makes it available to non-subscribers on a pay-per-view basis or some type of Go subscription.<br /><br />Another thing is that HBO comes with more than one HBO channel, if that's what you were indicating by \"dozens of other channels.\"  I think my cable HBO package has like 7 or 8 HBO channels, and I know the satellite HBO packages were similar.  If you're talking about other non-HBO channels, you might try calling your provider directly because they usually try to be accommodating to make their customers happy.  They're also able to give discounts that aren't advertised... my story:  <br /><br />I ordered cable online with a install date of this coming Saturday, I got an email yesterday saying they would install next Wednesday, I called them, let them know I was upset about it, they said they could get it installed the next day (today) but otherwise it would be on the 20th, I told them I wanted to cancel to see if I could get satellite on Saturday, while waiting for a fee to get reimbursed the guy decided to give me a discount on my current internet plan (to keep me as a customer) and improved the data rate of the internet plan, he then offered a discounted digital package and free Showtime to go along with the HBO.  I wanted my install on Saturday because I simply didn't want to take off work to get cable installed... but by calling them and maybe being a little upset, I'm now getting an upgraded internet, more channels and Showtime for less money than I was about to pay when ordering online.  So, if I were you, I'd definitely call to get set up and maybe find something to be upset about the price or options offered before calling.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"April 12 2011, 15:25:32 UTC","parent":12908873,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Payment options","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://the12judge.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"the12judge","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"the12judge","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://the12judge.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"the12judge","ctime_ts":1302621932,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12911177#t12911177","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12911177#t12911177","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12911177#t12911177","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"onsenweb","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://onsenweb.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12911177,"talkid":50434,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208713.html?thread=12911177#t12911177","upictitle":"onsenweb: pic#0","article":"Hi, I watched the preview of the 1st episode the other day, and I've been disappointed by the fact that there is no smoke coming out from people mouths at the wall.
