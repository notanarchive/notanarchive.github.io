{"itemid":162,"event":"I hate this time of year.  First off, it's tax time, so I have spent most of the last three days dealing with little bits of paper, to get things in order for my accountant.  The process was less painful this year, since I had my valiant assistant, Ty Franck, to help with the process -- but that doesn't mean it was fun.  Taxes are the price we pay for civilization, and I don't mind paying them, really I don't.  It's just the bloody record keeping that drives me mad.  \r\n\r\nAh, well.  It's done now.  Everything is in the hands of my accountant, and in a few weeks he'll get back to me and let me know how much I owe.  (A lot.  You guys buy a lot of books.  Do keep that up, please). \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, spring has come to Santa Fe.  Flowers are popping up, leaves are appearing shyly on trees, grass is growing.  Which means my allergies are popping up as well.  That's the other thing I hate about this time of year.  Sneezing, sniffing, watery eyes, popping pills.\r\nBah, humbug.  'Winter is coming' may sound ominous, but it's 'spring is here' that makes me blood run cold.  Ah - CHOOO.  sniff sniff sniff\r\n\r\nThere's cool news too.  Awards and more awards.\r\n\r\nLet's see.  The audiobook of DREAMSONGS (vol 1), produced by Janet Stark and Random House Audio, and featuring a stellar cast of readers including Yours Truly, has been nominated for the prestigious Audie Award as the best science fiction audiobook of 2007.  We're up against Frank Herbert, Larry Niven, Diana Paxson, and Jack Finney.  For a full list of all the Audie nominations, visit http://www.theaudies.com/\r\n\r\nAnd DREAMSONGS (vol 1) is also up for the Golden Chazzie.  Actually, it's up for two Golden Chazzies -- one for Best Fiction, and one for Best Audiobook.  To tell the truth, I don't know much about the Golden Chazzie.  If you go to http://www.needcoffee.com/2007-chazzie-nominations/ you will know as much about the Chazzies as I do.  It appears to be an award given by some guys who need coffee.  Hey, if I win, I'll send them some!  (Or would that be considered to be bribing the judges?) I hope it's made of real gold.\r\n\r\nThe Hugo nominations are also out.  I was thrilled to see Daniel Abraham make the list in novelette, and very pleased that the novel list included Michael Chabon's novel.   I liked the Campbell finalists as well.  \r\n\r\nGot to say, though, I was disappointed by some of the other categories... not so much because of who made the ballot, but because of who didn't.  We missed our last chance to honor Ellen Asher for her long decades of great work as editor of the Science Fiction Book Club, and that's a shame.  And the Best Fanzine nominators continue to ignore the growing importance of blogs and websites.  One day a blogozine will win a place on the ballot, and one day John Howe and Alan Lee and the other deserving artists I wrote about last month will get some recognition... but not this year, it seems.  \r\n\r\nOh, well.  As the Brooklyn Dodger fans of my childhood were wont to say, \"Wait'll Next Year.\"","ditemid":41670,"eventtime":"2008-03-22 15:59:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":562,"commentalter":1206551625,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","verticals_list":"culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-03-22 22:14:48","anum":198,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html","event_timestamp":1206201540,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/100982863/461829","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?replyto=3745478","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745478#t3745478","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745478#t3745478","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745478#t3745478","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mladshii","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mladshii.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3745478,"talkid":14630,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745478#t3745478","upictitle":"Зловещая тень Трианнона: ZedLebowsky","article":"Excuse me, sir, but we can keep bying your books as long as you keep writing them.<br />we are really looking forward to read \"dance with dragons\"<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"March 22 2008, 22:43:44 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mladshii.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mladshii","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mladshii","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mladshii.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mladshii","ctime_ts":1206225824,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122098640/13353665","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?replyto=3745990","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745990#t3745990","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745990#t3745990","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745990#t3745990","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sistercrow","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sistercrow.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3745990,"talkid":14632,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/41670.html?thread=3745990#t3745990","above":3745478,"upictitle":"sistercrow: Black cat eyes","article":"Damn!

Each crop could do what a lot of crops in the Sacramento Valley do, which is bear one crop, have that harvested, and grow more— that works mostly with tomatoes, BTW. When that happens, though, you don't get one big overload of pollen but a more diffused sort of pollination, one that I would assume would be below the trigger threshold for most allergy sufferers.<br /><br /><i>Furthermore</i>, there is a lot of increasing evidence that allergies are the body's parasite removal system going haywire in the absence of parasites. The best evidence for that is the distinct lack of allergies in parasite-heavy areas such as Southeast Asia, regardless of genetic origin. Basically the system is overreacting in the absence of a threat. One might assume from the fact that Westeros is far below the antiseptic standards of, say, antibacterial fanatics of the US that there is a greater chance of minor parasites in the life of a citizen of Westeros, and thus far less chance of allergies as we know them.<br /><br />The really scary part of this reply is that I didn't have to look it up.

Just to give you some more info on the Chazzies: in actuality, you've already won two of them.  <a href=\"http://www.needcoffee.com/2004-golden-chazzie-winners/books-and-music/\" rel=\"nofollow\">One in 2004 for Best Audiobook for THRONES</a> and <a href=\"http://www.needcoffee.com/2005-golden-chazzie-winners/2005-books-and-music/\" rel=\"nofollow\">one in 2005 for Best Fiction for CROWS</a>.  I discovered you and your work via the ICE AND FIRE audiobooks and I've infected the entire staff at the site with an appreciation for the books.  So much so that we tried to distill the teachings of the series into <a href=\"http://www.needcoffee.com/2006/02/04/everything-i-need-to-know-i-learned-from-george-r-r-martins-song-of-ice-and-fire/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an easily digestible list of bits</a> (slight language warning).  We try to contact as many nominees and winners as we can, but I see our previous efforts to get to you were unsuccessful, for which I apologize.  I'd be glad to send you the reasonably spiffy certificates we created for the winners and even some celebratory coffee (though I appreciate the offer to send us some--you are a scholar and a gentleman) if I knew the right snail mail address to use.  I fear we can't afford the actual *golden* statues yet, but one of these days.  Anyway, just say the word, sir.  Thanks for your work.
