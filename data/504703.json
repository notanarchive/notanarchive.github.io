{"itemid":1971,"subject":"A Simple Observation","event":"New Mexico has been a battlefield state in past presidential elections, most recently in 2000 and 2004, but Obama carried it easily both times, and of late it has been trending blue.  So much so that until very recently it was considered safe for Clinton this time around, which meant that neither side was paying us much attention.  \r\n\r\nThat's changed in the last couple of weeks.  All of a sudden, it is thought that the Land of Enchantment is in play, and we're seeing campaign commercials for both sides daily, often hourly.  All summer our airwaves were blessedly free of those, but now one can't escape them.  Some of them are positive ads, about the wonderful things the candidates is going to do for us... but the vast majority are negative, attacking the opponent.  Sadly, that seems to have become the default setting for politics in this 21st century of ours.\r\n\r\nWatching them, however, a very huge and basic difference struck me.  \r\n\r\nThe Trump commercials are all fairly standard political attack ads.  You've seen a thousand like them.  Find some bad pictures of the opponent, in this case Hillary, pictures that make them look ugly or angry or crazed (easily done, there are thousands of unflattering pictures of any public figure floating around these days).  If they are not bad enough, put them up in black & white, which always seems to make them worse.  Juxtapose them with negative imagery, maybe some out of context headlines. Use a faceless narrator's voice over the pictures telling us that the candidate is corrupt or a liar or \"too extreme.\"   The latest Trump ad manages to add Anthony Weiner, who is called \"Pervert Anthony Weiner.\"   The blatant name-calling -- flinging around words like 'pervert' and 'crooked' -- is not something we have often seen before in American politics, unless you go back to the 18th and 19th centuries; that's Trump's own original ugly contribution to lowering the tenor of political discourse.  The rest, however, is Attack Ad 101.   \r\n\r\nWhat's notable here is that the whole thing is accusation.  It's one side calling the other side names.   If any political positions are presented, they are usually distorted.  Smith says Jones is corrupt.  Jones says Smith is a liar.  Smith says Jones voted for something unpopular.  Jones says Smith favors something vile.  Trump's ads against Hillary tick every box here.   They are made of assertion, innuendo, and name-calling, but there's no substance to them.\r\n\r\nClinton's ads are something else.  Very different, and -- to my mind -- much more truthful.  The star of all the Clinton ads in Donald J. Trump.  There are no deliberately unflattering photographs, however.  Nothing in black and white.  Just video clips, full color, professional footage from news cameras at his rallies, interviews, television appearances.   There's no name-calling either.  Clinton doesn't need to label Trump as \"crooked\" or \"a liar\" or link him with \"perverts.\"  Clinton's ads just show Trump being Trump.   \r\n\r\nSo what we have here is not Smith claiming that Jones said terrible things.  What we have is actual footage of Jones saying and doing those things.   No one has to accuse Trump of anything, he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see.\r\n\r\nYes, he mocked a disabled reporter.  There he is, doing it.\r\n\r\nYes, he told Billy Bush he liked to kiss women without their consent and grab them by their pussies.  There he is, boasting about it.  When you're a star, you can do anything.\r\n\r\nNo need to accuse Trump of going into the dressing rooms of Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pagaents when the contestants were changing so he could see them naked.  There's Trump himself, telling Howard Stern about it.\r\n\r\nYes, he said women should be punished for having abortions.   There he is, telling Chris Matthews.   His own words, his own face.\r\n\r\nYes, he said he wants to ban all Muslims from entering the US.  Here, see the clip.\r\n\r\nYes, he's in favor of Japan and Saudi Arabia and South Korea having nukes, here's the clip where he says so.   \r\n\r\nAnd on and on and on and on.  The Gold Star family, the bad hombres, Judge Curiel, the Miss Universe contestant... his own speeches, his own tweets, his own words. \r\n\r\nThe usual pattern in election is that Smith says Jones said something terrible, and Jones denies it.  Not so here.  Hillary does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that Trump is using.  She only needs to present him as he is, and let his own words condemn them.\r\n\r\nAnd they do.\r\n\r\nIn my lifetime, there has never been a presidential candidate more unfit to lead this nation.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to like Hillary.   You don't need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump.   You just need to <i><b>listen to Trump.</b></i>   If you can do that, and still consider voting for him... well...\r\n\r\nPappy Bush lost an election by looking at his watch.   Michael Dukakis lost an election by riding around in a tank.  Howard Dean lost an election by giving a <i>yeeeehah </i>scream.  Trivial things.  Insignificant things.  Trump, on the other hand, has said the vilest things any presidential candidate has said since George Wallace, and he's rising in the polls.  \r\n\r\nHe has boasted that he could shoot someone dead on Fifth Avenue and still not lose any votes.  I am beginning to think he was right.","ditemid":504703,"eventtime":"2016-11-04 13:51:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"politics","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Nov  4 19:50:16 2016]R [Fri Nov  4 19:50:17 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/794627850548584448 ","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1479017253,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/794627850548584448","ratingbot_comment":"[cyr:-|ua:-|noncyr:8|by:-|ru:-|rureg:-]","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"hasscreened":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"likes_first_notify":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.599298032855439]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1478289070}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1971","revtime":1478377497},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-04 19:50:16","anum":127,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html","event_timestamp":1478267460,"reply_count":223,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126836815/79163276","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25168511#t25168511","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25168511#t25168511","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25168511#t25168511","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3880436","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Yestfl","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25168511,"talkid":98314,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25168511#t25168511","article":"If anyone knows about politics it's you! <br />Truer words have never been spoken.

There's 3 of them you just listed that stood right out as blatantly false.<br />1. Trump did not say \"ban all muslims\". He said to temporarily ban them until we find a way to vet them. That's a big difference from straight up banning them. Almost every high ranking Defense expert has said that ISIS will infiltrate the refugee flow. Are we racist now if we dont let the enemy onto our shores?<br />2. Trump did not mock that disabled reporter. He did the same exact thing talking about Ted Cruz and him being flustered and no one said a word. The reporter in question had a deformed arm. Trump is clearly shaking both arms and stuttering the same way someone who is panicking would be. If the reporter had cerebral palsy I would say yes. But come on, when I see that I do not see how that is making fun of someone with 1 deformed hand.<br />3. This is your most blatant one. Chris Matthews asked Trump a hypothetical, saying if abortion were to be outlawed, should there be punishment for those who get them? Trump clearly responded that the law is the law and you shouldn't be allowed to break them even if you disagree with them. Just because you don't like a law doesn't mean you can break it and get a free ride. <br />I'm not  big fan of Trump myself, and I wont even begin to defend some of the other insane things he has said.

Bravo for speaking up, as a public figure I hope more people will see reason with what you've written here. As someone in the always constant battleground state of Florida, I can empathize with the sickening ad's that are non-stop. Last night while watching the big bang theory with my 10 year old son a new trump commercial came on and this one was a cartoon. Yes a cartoon, it was vile and revolting and my son immediately wanted to know why they would do that. I wish I had a good answer for him, but I don't. In any case I would like to show you a campaign ad that is 1 minute long, and great. I don't know anything about the guy in the ad aside from he's not in my state. I hope you like it as much as I did. <a href='https://youtu.be/wzjRwNUQDRU' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/wzjRwNUQDRU</a> <br /><br />Edit*<br />P.S.

As a person who leans right I just can't ever support Trump, he's unacceptable and I'm disappointed that those on the left don't see Hillary in the same light but that's fine that's their own prerogative.  Where I see it so glaringly is in the media, yes Trump is awful and we need to know every awful thing he has done but we need the same about Hillary, since I think it's likely she'll be our next president.  I'm seeing almost nobody on the left stand up and suggest that Donna Brazile is unacceptable as the head chair of the DNC after the scandal with her giving questions to the Hillary Clinton campaign...maybe no one wants to show anything negative up to the election but I want dozens of op-eds in the media showing how she MUST step down from the DNC after that clear rigging of the Democratic primary.  Here's a link to the Donna Brazile story if you haven't heard about it: http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/31/media/do<wbr />nna-brazile-cnn-resignation/index.html<br /><br />Anyway, I think we need a bit more balance in the media and we need to maintain our integrity with non-partisan slant even if it makes our chosen candidate look bad.  I'm in favor something called \"diversity of thought\" to at least open up the media (and other important institutions) to allow it to be more transparent about bias/unbalance in their political make up.  Here's an article I've written about it:<br />http://foundingfathersforum.com/index.ph<wbr />p/topics/diversity-of-thought/<br /><br />I hope that we can all come out of this election with our integrity intact.  I appreciate the fact that you helped to reinforce my view that Trump is unacceptable and I really do hope above all else that after this election is done, no matter which way it turns out that we can all come together and get things done and push for more cooperation in all aspects of our lives as Americans.<br /><br />BTW, you're the best author I've ever read, keep up the good work!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 4 2016, 20:28:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Interesting Take on the Election","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Mithrandir48","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Mithrandir48","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3880485","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=79163630&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"November 4 2016, 20:49:43 UTC","dname":"Mithrandir48","ctime_ts":1478291329,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25183871#t25183871","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25183871#t25183871","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25183871#t25183871","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25183871#t25183871","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25183871,"talkid":98374,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25183871#t25183871","above":25173119,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Even a few decades ago, Congress included plenty of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans.

Yet, you go on to make the point that nobody should vote for Trump because of the awful things he has done, and for some of the crazy positions he supports. While I agree that nobody in his right mind should vote for Trump, your conclusion that people should vote for Hillary as the more savory option in this election seems to be of the same fallacious reasoning with which you began the post. If it's supposed to be about the issues, then why should Hillary earn anyone's vote? <br /><br />Donald Trump says some pretty reckless things about bombing ISIS and letting other countries have nukes, but Hillary's stance on Syria is truly terrifying. Her staunch defense of a no-fly zone in Syria is pure warmongering with Russia, a country that could literally bring about nuclear Armageddon if provoked too hard. All this baseless talk of Donald Trump starting World War III or the end of the world, when the most likely cause of either of these things is a war with Russia. And here is Hillary Clinton accusing Russia of espionage with no proof and poking them with her stance on Syria, and very few people seem to care. Even Dick Cheney wasn't this much of a war hawk. A Feast for Crows was a wonderful portrait of just how awful war is.<br /><br />I think the only morally acceptable thing to do is to urge people not to participate in this election, or to vote for a third party candidate like Jill Stein. Hillary Clinton will have blood on her hands, and anyone who votes for her knowing about her hawkishness will have blood on his hands by extension.<br /><br />I know Jill Stein isn't going to win this election, but I voted for her anyway. I think if voters had any idea about who she is or what she stands for, then she would surely be a viable candidate for the presidency. Getting someone like her to win only requires that her candidacy be put over the tipping point between obscurity and the mainstream. Popularity is extremely contagious, so putting her over this tipping point would not actually be that difficult, so long as the people who do know about her and support what she stands for don't write her off as a loser at the beginning of every election cycle and declare for one of the big two parties. <br /><br />A third party candidate will be seen as a viable option for voters when he is seen as an option at all. As soon as he is seen as a viable option, then a huge chunk of voters from the big two parties will vote for him, and a huge number of voters disillusioned by the lack of choice between the two big parties will vote for him as well. But it all comes back to making him be seen as an option at all for the voters, putting him over that tipping point between obscurity and the mainstream. The only way this can happen is if people support the third-party candidate through and through and speak out in favor of him even when he has no chance of winning. Losing a battle doesn't mean losing the war, and winning the war doesn't mean not losing a battle. But losing everyone's support because you're going to lose a battle definitely means losing the war.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 4 2016, 21:25:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"What about the big issues?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nerdoldnerdith.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nerdoldnerdith","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nerdoldnerdith","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nerdoldnerdith.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nerdoldnerdith","ctime_ts":1478294727,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25181823#t25181823","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25181823#t25181823","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25181823#t25181823","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25181823#t25181823","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25181823,"talkid":98366,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504703.html?thread=25181823#t25181823","above":25177983,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I made the same arguments myself in 1980, when I supported and campaigned for John Anderson.<br /><br />Maybe at some point in our history the two party system will break down, and we'll have more choice.  If Trump were to lose in a landslide (one can dream), it might happen sooner or later if the GOP broke apart, into the Trump Party and the Ryan/ Romney Republicans.<br /><br />That day is not here, however, and in this present election the gulf between the two major candidates is too wide to permit the luxury of casting a third party vote.  War is indeed awful, you and I agree on that, but unlike you I believe Trump is much more likely to get us there than Hillary would.  And there are other issues... so many other issues... on which she is right and Trump is wrong.<br /><br />Trump himself has said that Hillary would be like having a third term for Obama.  Good by me.  I'm down with that.  Obama was a good president, and if the GOP had worked with him AT ALL, he might have been a great one.
