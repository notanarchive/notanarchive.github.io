{"itemid":1090,"subject":"Limited Editions","event":"From time to time I get emails from readers wanting to know how they can purchase copies of the signed, illustrated limited editions of the Ice & Fire books published by Meisha Merlin and Subterranean.  The short answer is, they can't.  Those were limited editions, they were fully subscribed, Meisha Merlin is out of business, and SubPress has no extra copies for sale.\r\n\r\n(Yes, I have a few extra copies myself, but they are not for sale).\r\n\r\nHowever, I've just happened to notice that there are presently not one but two (2!) sets of said limited up for bid on ebay.  These are the numbered editions (not the rarer lettered), and both have matching numbers.\r\n\r\nThe ebay item numbers are 221012911878 and 150806055324.\r\n\r\nI don't know the sellers, and I can't vouch for them or the condition of their books.  (I will vouch for the fact that these are gorgeous books, lavishly illustrated by Jeff Jones, John Howe, Charles Vess, and Tom Canty, respectively).  These ebay sales have nothing to do with me, and I cannot tell you more than I just have.  If you have questions, you will need to contact the sellers.  But considering how often I get asked about those books, I thought I'd mention it, if any of you are interested.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised: these sets are not cheap.  The books have appreciated quite a bit in value since publication.","ditemid":279255,"eventtime":"2012-05-05 16:24:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"limited editions, subterranean, meisha merlin, ebay, signed books","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1337703195,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Ashford","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1337839198},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-05-05 22:26:16","anum":215,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html","event_timestamp":1336235040,"reply_count":49,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/101640037/725562","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932119#t15932119","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932119#t15932119","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932119#t15932119","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"eeepeeep","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://eeepeeep.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15932119,"talkid":62234,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932119#t15932119","upictitle":"Monkey: Smile!","article":"Not interested at this time but thanks for posting about them, I hope you do so in the future when I might be looking to purchase!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 5 2012, 23:02:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://eeepeeep.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"eeepeeep","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"eeepeeep","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://eeepeeep.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"eeepeeep","ctime_ts":1336258962,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116400209/38295894","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932375#t15932375","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932375#t15932375","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932375#t15932375","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932375#t15932375","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"howdyphillip","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://howdyphillip.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15932375,"talkid":62235,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279255.html?thread=15932375#t15932375","upictitle":"howdyphillip: pic#116400209","article":"It looks like they are gone already.

I have had various collectors and dealers make persuasive arguments both ways -- that the new SubPress books will bring down the prices of the older MM editions, or that they will have no effect on those prices.  <br /><br />I incline toward the latter view.  At least one dealer I questioned said pointedly, \"well, I won't be lowering MY prices.\"  There are so few of the MM books out there available for sale that really, all it will take is a few like him and the prices will hold.  These values are all ultimately arbitrary anyway.  The value of the book is whatever someone is willing to sell it for, and someone else is willing to pay.<br /><br />And, bottom line, though the text will be same, the rest of the edition will be quite different.  Starting with the artists.  For GOT, Jeff Jones for the Meisha Merlin, Ted Nasmith for the SubPress.  For COK, John Howe for MM, Richard Hescox for SubPress.  Completists may well want both versions, which could drive the prices higher.<br /><br />Ultimately, the biggest factor that could drive down prices is the HBO series.  If and when it finally runs its course and goes off the air, I suspect demand will start to fade.  (Many years from now, I hope).  I think that will have more impact than the new SubPress editions.<br /><br />But it's all just speculation.  I don't know.
