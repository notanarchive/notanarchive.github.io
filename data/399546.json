But, he was saddled with a terrible quarterback situation (partly of his own creation with E.J. Manuel). If he takes over the Jets (or anyone for that matter), you still need a quarterback. Anyone coming into the Jets is going to do the same or slightly worse job as Rex because they don't have a quarterback. My belief is that they will do worse, because Rex is a superlative defense coach. <br /><br />My hope beyond all hope is that we've seen the last of these \"read option/running\" quarterbacks. With one glaring exception in Seattle (and watch what happens when Beastmode isn't there anymore to see how the read option works), this doesn't work in the NFL. The Manuels, Geno Smiths, Johnny Manziel, Vince Young, etc., of the world should go to Canada where they belong. I want to watch \"Pro\" football, not a glorified college offensive scheme where you just put the ball in your hands of the best athlete and hope for the best. <br /><br />As a Cowboys fan, I have better hopes for your Giants next year than you do. I will tell you that the NFL is better when the NFC East is competitive from top to bottom. Coughlin is a good coach. He'll fix the lines on both sides of the ball, and you'll be in the playoffs next year (especially with a 3rd place schedule).
