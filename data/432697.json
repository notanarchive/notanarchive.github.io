(They were also Jack Vance's publisher for most of the last few decades).  \r\n\r\nSONGS OF LOVE AND DEATH was published by Fallery Books in hardcover and Pocket Books in paperback, and contains work by Jim Butcher, Diana Gabaldon, and many more.\r\n\r\nWe have also added some new titles (all SIGNED) by Jo Walton, Susan Orlean (her biography of Rin Tin Tin is fascinating reading) and Anne Perry, among others.\r\n\r\nCheck them all out at http://www.jeancocteaubooks.com/","ditemid":432697,"eventtime":"2015-07-08 13:01:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"signed books","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1436909607,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"More Signed Books http://goo.gl/i7JkAh","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.703320579262289]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1436394001}","revtime":1437164194},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-08 19:00:43","anum":57,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html","event_timestamp":1436360460,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126586149/71212094","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21938233#t21938233","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21938233#t21938233","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21938233#t21938233","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bloodofstark","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bloodofstark.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21938233,"talkid":85696,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21938233#t21938233","article":"hi George, my master<br />can you say hi to me? this is very important to me <br />I love you ","upictitle":"Juliana Bertoldi: pic#126586149","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"1 year ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"July 8 2015, 19:08:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hi","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bloodofstark.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bloodofstark","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bloodofstark","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bloodofstark.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bloodofstark","ctime_ts":1436382491,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21939769#t21939769","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21939769#t21939769","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21939769#t21939769","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21939769,"talkid":85702,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/432697.html?thread=21939769#t21939769","above":21938233,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I was up until midnight the other night finishing it because it was too suspenseful to put down.<br /><br />I discovered you through ASOIAF, but am now getting into reading your older works.  I've been a lifelong sci-fi fan, and I love your approach to the genre.  DOTL was more imaginative than the majority of sci-fi coming out these days, and your world-building is second-to-none.  Kyrne Lamiya is the coolest city I've ever read about, and I can easily imagine it's cosmic cousin turning up in the far reaches of Essos!<br /><br />Thank you for all you do, George, you inspire me!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 12 2015, 19:00:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1648271168728185/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jamie Makin","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3219858","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76415190&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jamie Makin","ctime_ts":1436727605,"tracked":0}]}
