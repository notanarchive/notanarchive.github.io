{"itemid":2030,"subject":"A Bit More (Fake) History","event":"I had intended to write this post a few days ago, when Bantam gave me the green light, but I got busy, and we had Carrie Vaughn coming to town, and a worldcon/ Hugo deadline approaching, and all that seemed more time-sensitive, so I wrote those instead.  Unfortunately, that meant the news below broke from other sources, and inevitably, all sorts of weird distortions crept in, and now the internet is rife with rumors and false reports and misinformation.  Pfui.  I need to set the record straight.\r\n\r\nMy friend Gardner Dozois, long-time anthologist and winner (many many times) of the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor, has a big new fantasy anthology coming out this fall.  It's called THE BOOK OF SWORDS, and it's about... well... swords.  Y'know.  \"Stick 'em with the pointy end.\"\r\n\r\nI have a story in the book.   \"The Sons of the Dragon\" is the title.  Those of you who enjoyed \"The Princess and the Queen\" in DANGEROUS WOMEN and \"The Rogue Prince\" in ROGUES will probably like this one too.  It's water from the same well.  A history rather than a traditional narrative.  A lot of telling, only a little showing.  (The opposite of what I do in my novels).  But if you're fascinated by the politics of Westeros, as many of my readers seem to be, you should enjoy it.  As the title suggests, \"The Sons of the Dragon\" chronicles the reigns of the second and third Targaryen kings, Aenys I and Maegor the Cruel, along with their mothers, wives, sisters, children, friends, enemies, and rivals.  If you're read something to that effect on the web, good, that much is right.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a lot that's wrong out there as well.  THE BOOK OF SWORDS is not <i><b>my</b></i> book.  I didn't write but a small part of it, and I didn't edit it, nor even <i><b>co</b></i>-edit it.  Gardner is one of my oldest friends and he and I have co-edited a number of anthologies together.  We did OLD MARS and OLD VENUS together.  We did SONGS OF LOVE & DEATH and DOWN THESE STRANGE STREETS together.  We did the huge award-winning cross-genre anthologies WARRIORS, DANGEROUS WOMEN, and ROGUES together.   But we did not do THE BOOK OF SWORDS together.  \r\n\r\nSWORDS is all the Great Gargoo.  I mean, it's not as if he hasn't edited a hundred other anthologies all by himself, before he did a few with me.  We're friends, but we are not attached at the hip.  I edit Wild Cards without any help from Gardner, and he edits lots of great stuff without any help from me... including THE BOOK OF SWORDS and next year's THE BOOK OF MAGIC (which will also have a story from me, a reprint).\r\n\r\nTruth be told, I loved editing those anthologies with Gardner, and we want to do more together.  We're talked about MORE ROGUES and EVEN MORE DANGEROUS WOMEN, since those two books were hugely successful, and we have definite plans for OLD LUNA and, who knows, maybe eventually OLD MERCURY and OLD PLUTO and OLD URANUS.  But we're not doing any of that <i>NOW</i>.  The anthologies, much as I loved them, were taking too much of my time, so I stepped back from them... until I finish THE WINDS OF WINTER, at least.  Once that's done, maybe I can sneak another one in...\r\n\r\nThe point is, just because I had to step back did not mean Gardner had to.  And he hasn't.  Hence THE BOOK OF SWORDS, which I expect to be just as good as ROGUES or DANGEROUS WOMEN.\r\n\r\nThe lineup of THE BOOK OF SWORDS is an impressive one:\r\n\r\nIntroduction by Gardner Dozois\r\nTHE BEST MAN WINS, by K.J. Parker\r\nHIS FATHER'S SWORD, by Robin Hobb\r\nTHE HIDDEN GIRL, by Ken Liu\r\nTHE SWORD OF DESTINY, by Matthew Hughes\r\n“I AM A HANDSOME MAN,” SAID APOLLO CROW, by Kate Elliott\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE, by Walter Jon Williams\r\nTHE MOCKING TOWER, by Daniel Abraham\r\nHRUNTING, by C.J. Cherryh\r\nA LONG, COLD TRAIL, by Garth Nix\r\nWHEN I WAS A HIGHWAYMAN, by Ellen Kushner\r\nTHE SMOKE OF GOLD IS GLORY by Scott Lynch\r\nTHE COLGRID CONUNDRUM, by Rich Larson\r\nTHE KING'S EVIL, by Elizabeth Bear\r\nWATERFALLING, by Lavie Tidhar\r\nTHE SWORD TYRASTE, by Cecelia Holland\r\nTHE SONS OF THE DRAGON, by George R.R. Martin\r\n\r\nThere's some amazing writers there.  Some of the stories, I expect, will contend for the Hugo and the World Fantasy Award.  But I wouldn't know which, since I haven't read any of them yet, <i><b>since I am not the editor.</b></i>  Unlike, say, ROGUES and OLD MARS and the like, where I read every word, because I was the co-editor.\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF SWORDS is scheduled for release on October 10 in hardcover and ebook.  (I don't have the cover art yet, but when I do I will post it here).\r\n\r\nAs for my own story...\r\n\r\nLong-time lurkers on this site will recall that several years ago, when we were working on the gorgeous illustrated worldbook/ concordance that was eventually published as THE WORLD OF ICE & FIRE, I wrote a number of 'sidebar's about Westerosi history.  Actually, I got rather carried away, until I found I had written 350,000 words of sidebars for a book that was supposed to have only 50,000 words of text (it ended up having a lot more that that, actually).  Since I had only reached the regency of Aegon III the Dragonbane, and had largely skipped over Jaehaerys I the Conciliator, however, it became apparent that my sidebars were going to burst the book.\r\n\r\nSo we pulled them all out, including only severely abridged versions of the main events in THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE.  The full versions, much longer and unabridged, will eventually be published in a fake history tome to be called FIRE & BLOOD (and sometimes just the GRRMarillion), but since that one is years away, I included excerpts (again abridged, though not as severely) in DANGEROUS WOMEN and ROGUES.  That's where \"The Princess and the Queen\" and \"The Rogue Prince\" came from.\r\n\r\n\"The Sons of the Dragon\" came from the same place.  Gardner asked me for a story.  I told him I did not have the time to write a story.  He asked if perhaps I had more like \"The Princess and the Queen\" lying about... as it happened, I did.  So I sent him \"The Sons of the Dragon,\" he liked it, and there we are.  (Fwiw, though \"Sons\" has never been published before, some of you may have heard me read it at one convention or another.  I think I've read it twice, though offhand I do not recall when).\r\n\r\nAnyway... that's the story of the story.  Don't believe any other weird crap you may encounter on the web.  It's Gardner's book, and it should be a fine one.  You can't go wrong with Robin Hobb, Scott Lynch, Lavie Tidhar, Daniel Abraham, Matthew Hughes, and the rest of the contributors that Gargy has assembled.  You'll love their stuff, I know.  Maybe you'll like my contribution as well... if you're partial to fake history.","ditemid":519773,"eventtime":"2017-01-31 17:06:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa

Who are you referring to as a \"Maegor-come-again\"? One that \"nobody is particularly savvy to and many see as pointless\"?<br /><br />I don't suspect it's the boy currently calling himself Aegon Targaryen. For one thing, Young Griff has that quality halfway between eagerness and arrogance, but does not seem to have a cruel streak: for another, I think his destiny is to be the equivalent of a real-world Perkin Warbeck - a possible royal bastard or offshoot, who happens to look enough like a true member of the royal family for his claim of being a surviving \"murdered princeling\" to be plausible. Especially given all the setting up of the Blackfyre dynasty as a backstory plot, and the backing of the Blackfyre-supporting Golden Company, and the hint of a missing black dragon (inn sign) that turned up rusted to red. That's a popular theory - Aegon being a Blackfyre descent.<br /><br />But a \"Maegor come again\"? Are we missing a descendant of the OTHER Maegor - the son of Aerion Brightflame who was disinherited by Grand Council, who might have a better blood claim than anyone, Daenerys and all? <br /><br />Or is it a reference to a truly cruel wannabe-king who seems to have taken against all kinds of religions and beliefs as Maegor did, which would fit Euron Greyjoy (who is still barely known outside of the really intense fandom community that actually checks up on unpublished sneak previews and readings)? It's been hinted that Euron may turn into one of Daenerys's greatest enemies - the one-eyed kraken floating on a sea of blood that Moqorro hinted at. That would definitely fit your comment about many seeing him as pointless, since he's hardly shown himself at all in the TV series, and even in the books we've seen surprisingly little yet.<br /><br />Or were you meaning someone else entirely?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"February 1 2017, 03:53:41 UTC","parent":25695581,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: SO stoked for this.","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://themadpianist.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"themadpianist","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"themadpianist","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://themadpianist.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"themadpianist","ctime_ts":1485921221,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/72220277/3789548","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25695837#t25695837","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25695837#t25695837","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25695837#t25695837","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"uncle_twitchy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://uncle-twitchy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25695837,"talkid":100374,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25695837#t25695837","upictitle":"uncle_twitchy: pic#72220277","article":"Scott Lynch, Daniel Abraham and Robin Hobb?

I was there and really had fun madly scribbling very detailed notes down.<br /><br />Will some parts of the story be edited out like it was done with 'The Prince and the Queen' and 'The Rogue Prince'? What you read about the reign of Aenys I definitely was short enough to be only a short novella but only you know how much is coming during the bloody reign of Maegor the Cruel...<br /><br />By the way - there seems to be an inconsistency between 'The Sons of the Dragon' and the way things are portrayed in TWoIaF: In 'The Sons of the Dragon' you had Maegor hang out on Dragonstone most of his young life with his mother, resulting in him becoming known as the Prince of Dragonstone. But in TWoIaF Aenys is referred to as the Prince of Dragonstone before he becomes king upon the death of the Conqueror. I really liked the idea that the Heir Apparent of the Iron Throne was not always the Prince of Dragonstone but that this thing sort of thing only came to be when Aenys I stripped Maegor of that title when he sent him into exile, bestowing it upon his own son and heir, Aegon, instead.<br /><br />A similar thing goes for the Dornish wars. In Gyldayn's account of the Conquest it says that after First Dornish War that ended in failure the attempts to subdue the Dornish 'continued well into the reigns of Aegon's sons'. But 'The Sons of the Dragon' does not mention any Dornish wars during the reign of Aenys I aside from the first Vulture King uprising which had the Targaryens fight the Dornish on their soil. Were there any such wars later during the reign of Maegor or during the two year tenure of Maegor as Aenys I's Hand? Or was Aenys I contemplating at one time to bring Dorne into the Realm by marriage, as Viserys I later did? Aenys I had a lot of children and could very well have married Viserys, Jaehaerys, or Alysanne to the heir of Dorne...<br /><br />Can you clarify what's 'true' there?<br /><br />And can you tease a little bit about the undeveloped aspects of the Targaryen family tree, most notably who Alyssa Velaryon's Targaryen mother had been (she and Aenys I were cousins) who the Sea Snake's Targaryen mother was (if he had any), or what ultimately happened to Aerea and Rhalla, the twin girls of Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"February 1 2017, 09:41:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Some details","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lord-varys.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lord_varys","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lord_varys","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lord-varys.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lord_varys","ctime_ts":1485942112,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124302622/73354478","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25709405#t25709405","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25709405#t25709405","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25709405#t25709405","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2902334","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25709405,"talkid":100427,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519773.html?thread=25709405#t25709405","above":25704285,"upictitle":"The Dragon Demands: pic#124302622","article":"Your report was amazing and much appreciated at the time, Lord Varys.<br /><br /><br />****I asked Elio about that:  turns out that the reference to Aenys as \"Prince of Dragonstone\" was a typo in the first-run print edition.
