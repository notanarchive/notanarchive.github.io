{"itemid":1315,"subject":"Great Night at the Cocteau","event":"We had a great time last night at the Jean Cocteau with the first of our author events.\r\n\r\nHugo-, Nebula-, and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon was on hand to sign books and read from his latest, TELEGRAPH AVENUE.&nbsp; Before that part of the program, however, I inteviewed Michael for ninety minutes or so about his life, career, books, and views on writing and literature.&nbsp; The Cocteau was packed, our first &quot;sell out&quot; crowd since we stopped giving away free tickets.&nbsp; We&nbsp; had to turn away about twenty people, sad to say (next time, guys and gals, get those tickets in advance).&nbsp; Those who got in were glad they did.&nbsp; Popcorn, pizza, and talk about books, can&#39;t beat it.\r\n\r\nMichael is a great guy and a great writer, and a delightful conversationalist.&nbsp; We were thrilled to have him.&nbsp; He&#39;s on his way to Pittsburgh right now, and will be reading and signing at a B&amp;N tonight, so if you&#39;re in the Pittsburgh area, still time to attend.&nbsp; In subsequent days he&#39;ll be appearing in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City as well.&nbsp; Be sure to see him if you get a chance... and snatch up a copy or three of TELEGRAPH AVENUE, KAVALIER &amp; CLAY, GENTLEMEN OF THE ROAD, or one of his other titles.\r\n\r\nOh, and I also wanted to mention Michael&#39;s limited edition Brokeland t-shirts.&nbsp; You can snag one of them here:\r\n\r\nhttp://teespring.com/brokeland\r\n\r\nAll the money raised by the t-shirt sales is going to 826 National and their youth literacy programs (http://826national.org/ ) and the McDowell Colony and their writers&#39; retreats (http://www.macdowellcolony.org/ ), both worthy causes.&nbsp;","ditemid":336818,"eventtime":"2013-09-15 13:44:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, charity, good causes","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1379473598,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1380639326},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-09-15 19:44:40","anum":178,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336818.html","event_timestamp":1379252640,"reply_count":1,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122246798/66408214","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336818.html?thread=18248114#t18248114","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336818.html?thread=18248114#t18248114","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336818.html?thread=18248114#t18248114","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2178218","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/102557754310510220580","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18248114,"talkid":71281,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336818.html?thread=18248114#t18248114","article":"Sounds like a great event.
