{"itemid":1749,"subject":"Dunk & Egg Are HERE","event":"Big day, big excitement.  It's <b><i>publication day</i></b> for A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS, with simultaneous hardcover releases scheduled for the US (Bantam Spectra) and the UK (Harper Collins Voyager).\r\n\r\nThis will be the first collection of the three Dunk & Egg novellas that I have published to date: \"The Hedge Knight\" (originally published in Robert Silverberg's anthology LEGENDS), \"The Sworn Sword\" (from LEGENDS II), and \"The Mystery Knight\" (from the anthology WARRIORS, edited by Gardner Dozois and yours truly).  All together in one place for the first time, so you no longer need to track down three separate (and in some cases, out of print) books.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/289158/289158_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/287874/287874_1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\nBritish edition\r\n\r\nDepending (of course) on which side of the pond you find yourself, one or the other of the two editions should be available today from your favorite local bookstore or online bookseller.\r\n\r\nThe American edition is on Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/Knight-Seven-Kingdoms-Song-Fire/dp/0345533488/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1444154684&sr=1-1\r\n\r\nThe British edition can be found on Amazon UK at http://www.amazon.co.uk/Knight-Seven-Kingdoms-Song-Prequel/dp/0007507674/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1444154759&sr=1-1&keywords=a+knight+of+the+seven+kingdoms\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have yet to make the acquaintance of Dunk & Egg... these are stories set in Westeros about ninety years before the opening of A GAME OF THRONES, when the Targaryens still sat the Iron Throne..  They chronicle the adventures of the hedge knight called Ser Duncan the Tall and his young squire Egg as they travel across the Seven Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, before those of you from other lands across the sea speak up, it is true that the book has already been published in a dozen other languages.  That's because we wanted to do something rather special with the English-language editions, but many of my foreign publishers were not willing to wait.\r\n\r\nFor those who did wait, however, the \"extra\" is ART.  Gorgeous, stunning, evocative, lovely illustration.  We asked the amazing GARY GIANNI to illustrate the book, and Gary was so taken with the stories that he said he declined to do just the half-dozen pieces we originally asked for, insisting instead that he be allowed to illustrate the entire book.  Needless to say, we LOVED the idea.  I grew up and was weaned on the illustrated classics of my childhood with art by the likes of Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth, and the prospect of having one of my own books done the same way thrilled me no end.  \r\n\r\nAnd here it is, and believe me, it's everything I could have dreamed of.  Here's just a sample, to whet your appetites:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/288056/288056_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/288350/288350_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/288741/288741_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/288964/288964_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","ditemid":447919,"eventtime":"2015-10-06 12:27:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"voyager, bantam spectra, a song of ice and fire, publications, dunk & egg, game of thrones","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1444784566,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Dunk & Egg Are HERE http://goo.gl/M1qFFr","picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.72348438037978]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1444156237}","revtime":1444942566},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-10-06 18:27:41","anum":175,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html","event_timestamp":1444134420,"reply_count":91,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125099171/76105636","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803375#t22803375","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803375#t22803375","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803375#t22803375","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3177430","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Needles__Kane","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22803375,"talkid":89075,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803375#t22803375","upictitle":"Christ Arsenault: pic#125099171","article":"I need to finish my reread of A Storm of Swords first, dammit ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 6 2015, 18:32:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Needles__Kane","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Needles__Kane","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3177430","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76105636&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Needles__Kane","ctime_ts":1444156371,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125474951/76898429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803631#t22803631","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803631#t22803631","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803631#t22803631","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3333426","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Virginia_XL","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22803631,"talkid":89076,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22803631#t22803631","upictitle":"Virginia A.: pic#125474951","article":"I've been waiting for this!

A. Whipple: pic#111343425","article":"Your question of inspiration also interests me specifically from the writer’s point of view. I have been away from bookstores for over 20 years and thus I am uninformed what arrived on the shelves in their sequential order. I wonder if the Dunk & Egg stories served as A) a kind of proving ground for history that was already written in A Song of Ice & Fire, i.e. this is /how/ it happened /that/ way, OR B) a way to gather ideas for the inclusion of history to be written in the main story line, i.e. this idea occurred, was written as a short story, and thus the main series picked up on consequences from the novellas. These answers are from the opposite ends of story telling, and it would inform me how fleshed out A Song of Ice & Fire was before the Dunk & Egg stories. We already know the series started from a vision of the Starks finding the Dire Wolf pups – but that tells me nothing about the further process. <br /><br /><br />I can certainly muse that the third story fulfilled a contractual obligation and George Martin was too entrenched in the world he was writing in to author a fantasy story set in a different world. But there are the two earlier ones that might answer the question what came first: the Song’s World or the Egg that hatches it. <br /><br /><br />Possibly the dates of publication would do that but I have been known to file stories away into my desk a long time before showing them to anyone.  I wonder if George Martin would give us a look behind his writer’s curtain on this score? I would find looking at his craft fascinating, and I suspect any writer in fantasy today would as well. <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","below":22822831,"ctime":"October 7 2015, 16:54:38 UTC","parent":22811823,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: History of Dunk and Egg","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/RA_Whipple","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"RA_Whipple","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_677722","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=39034864&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"RA_Whipple","ctime_ts":1444236878,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22822831#t22822831","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22822831#t22822831","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22822831#t22822831","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_677722","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RA_Whipple","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22822831,"talkid":89151,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22822831#t22822831","above":22822575,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","parent":22811823,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: History of Dunk and Egg","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/RA_Whipple","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"RA_Whipple","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_677722","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=39034864&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"RA_Whipple","ctime_ts":1444237968,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22825391#t22825391","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22825391#t22825391","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22825391#t22825391","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"werthead","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22825391,"talkid":89161,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/447919.html?thread=22825391#t22825391","above":22822831,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","parent":22822831,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: History of Dunk and Egg","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"werthead","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"werthead","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"werthead","ctime_ts":1444252865,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0}]}
