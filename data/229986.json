{"itemid":898,"subject":"Leaving Seattle","event":"A thousand people turned up at Town Hall last night for my Seattle signing, sponsored by the University Bookstore.\r\n\r\nSeattle also included visits to Bungie (I could tell you what they are doing, but then I'd have to kill you) and Amazon (where they are selling lots o' books).  Cool stuff, great people.\r\n\r\nComicon, LA, and Redwood City already seem to be receding into the distant past.  The trip has become one long blur... but tiring as it is at times, it means a lot to me to meet so many of my readers.  I appreciate all of you coming, in spite of the crowds and long lines.\r\n\r\nThis morning we're off to Denver.  Tomorrow I sign at Tattered Cover.
