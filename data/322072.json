I met him a couple of times as well. In the right system, Geno could be a great QB. Looking at his first three years with WVU, he was not the star he became under Dana Holgerson (Coach of WVU) who is more pass oriented in his schemes. Given guidance, Geno Smith could be an asset to any NFL team. It is unfortunate that that guidance doesn't exist at the NY Jets. If last season is any indication, Geno might just sit and watch them shoot themselves in the foot until one or both QB's get injured, or he may be shoehorned in to confuse a defense. Neither of these scenarios play to Geno's strengths and will only serve to damage/ruin his future prospects. As a Geno Smith fan, I don't think there could have been a worse team to pick him up.<br /><br />St. Louis on the other hand! They took BOTH of our awesome WR's in Stedman Bailey and Tavon Austin. With Tavon returning punts and kickoffs and Bailey's magnetic fingers, St. Louis may become my new team to watch.

(Although I'm not sure why he's an iffier prospect than Sanchez was when he was drafted.)  Geno was inconsistent and infuriating at times.  There were also games when he was absolutely brilliant.  The good thing about Geno is there isn't a throw he can't make.  He's big, athletic, and has better arm strength than anyone on the JETS roster.  Biggest problem for Geno in NY is he won't have weapons like Tavon around him (to say nothing of the problems in the JETS front office.)  I know its a big if, but if they can work on calming him down I think he has the athleticism and field vision to make a franchise QB.

So I have no one to talk Jet/Giant football with. Just the whacko RG3 fans. Who think the Redskins will win the superbowl this year. <br /><br />So bear with my post. <br /><br />Giants: <br />Not sure what they will do at Linebacker. They usually ignore this. Right now, they are down 2 linebackers from last year and Kiwanuka needs to move to DE (where he is better). This is a very weak group even by Giants standards. Rivers has talent but can't stay on the field. Who knows about the guy they got from the cowboys.<br /><br />Secondary: Huh? This group was awful last year. Amukamarra was pretty good, but missed alot of games. What are the odds that an older player like Webster rebounds from a year where he was about the worst corner in the NFL? Can Terrell Thomas stay on the field and even play with that knee? Kenny Phillips was there best safety (in the 7 games when he was healthy) and he is gone. Antrelle Rolle is good in run support, but can't cover anyone. I am also wondering if Jayron Hosley was a bust. <br /><br />The Giant defense gave up 7000 yards last year... You can't cross your fingers and just hope for sacks. You have to cover. <br /><br /><br />Picks:<br />Pugh: Dunno. Short Arms? Who knows what that means. Can't be hard to be better than Diehl who is garbage. Reese has a good track record of hitting home runs in the first round. <br /><br />DT in 2nd Round: Are they giving up on Marvin Austin? Remember when he was supposed to be a steal. He can't stay healthy. Giants did have alot of trouble with DT depth so the 3 guys in the rotation were exhausted in the 2nd half. My guess is they want more guys in the rotation. <br /><br />DE in 3rd Round: Probably a project and won't get on the field this year unless there are alot of injuries. <br /><br />Nassib: Hopefully he never takes the field. I think this was a 'Peyton never got hurt until he did'. If so, he will leave via Free Agency in 4 years. Not sure I like this. David Carr is a quality backup and knows the system. This year they have to carry 3 QBs. I don't think they can afford to cut far. That means 1 less roster spot. <br /><br />Rest of the draft: Reese is hit and miss late in the draft. Mainly miss. <br /><br /><br />Jets: They are clearly not drafting for this year. They know they will suck. Plus they have 12m in cap space from Revis and almost 13m going to Sanchez. <br /><br />1st Round CB: Revis is a generational corner. There is no 'replacement for Revis'. An all pro is not a replacement for Revis, but if he is good. Its a good pick. <br /><br />1st Round DT: This is clearly a pick for down the road. There line is getting old. Dunno. Strikes me as more of a 4-3 Tackle. Your not going to get pressure as a NT. So maybe they see him as a 3-4 End? Or maybe they will go 4-3 in some situations? <br /><br />Geno: If he is good. Good pick. I have no idea if he will be good. I'm ok with a 2nd round pick and giving up a 6th to hope he is good. This is a QB league and Sanchez has to go. <br /><br />Rest of the Draft: I have no idea. These are just names on the page. So I hope some are good. <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2013, 15:26:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"fellow giant and jet fan","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://guessingo.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"guessingo","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"guessingo","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://guessingo.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"guessingo","ctime_ts":1367249213,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116250605/46995223","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322072.html?thread=17663000#t17663000","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322072.html?thread=17663000#t17663000","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322072.html?thread=17663000#t17663000","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1077639","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=692152717","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17663000,"talkid":68996,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322072.html?thread=17663000#t17663000","upictitle":"Matthew Cooley: pic#116250605","article":"Obviously the Jets big needs were offensive weapons and probably a linebacker able to rush the passer, but at 9th and 13th the value just wasn't there with Tavon Austin off the board.

I am a die-hard WVU fan. He is an amazing player. I watch the 2012 Orange Bowl DVD where a young Geno Smith led out team to defeat Clemson in a major upset just for fun (between episodes of GoT and re-reads of ASOIAF). There are things that are not generally known by the public about some of the issues with WVU's team this year that reflected on Geno, though not his fault, but the Jets have secured one of the hardest working, most determined players available. The release of Tim Tebow today should begin to clear up some questions about the Jets' intentions, but Geno will play his heart out and give his full attention to this opportunity. Give him a chance, please!<br /><br />In the meantime, still waiting to hear from you on my script proposition and my series thoughts for a Civil War drama based on Mosby's Men.
