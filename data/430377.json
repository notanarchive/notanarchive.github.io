{"itemid":1681,"subject":"Hugo Voting Continues","event":"With the Puppy Wars heating up again -- not that they have ever really cooled down -- this seems an opportune moment to remind all and sundry that there is still plenty of time left to join Sasquan and cast your ballot for this year's Hugo awards.\r\n\r\nWith the electronic ballot, once you have a membership number and a PIN, you can go and post some preferences and votes now, then return a day later, or a week later, or a month later, and change them, or add some more rankings. Your vote does not get counted until balloting closes.\r\n\r\nThe ballot is here: http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/voting/\r\n\r\nIf you have not voted the Hugo Awards before, please note that it is an \"Australian ballot,\" a preferential system whereby one ranks the nominees. You don't just vote for one. You can rank NO AWARD as if it were any other finalist; ahead of some nominees, behind others.\r\n\r\n(Which is the way I believe one should use NO AWARD. As I have stated previously, I am opposed to the nuclear option of just blindly voting NO AWARD in every category).\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to be a member to vote. Supporting Memberships will cost you $40. You can sign up to buy one at https://sasquan.swoc.us/sasquan/reg.php\r\n\r\nIn addition to voting privileges, a Supporting Membership will get you the convention's program book (usually a handsome item, though it varies from year to year) and other publications.\r\n\r\nYou can also sign up as an ATTENDING member and actually attend the convention, which is the course I strongly recommend for those who have the time and the money.  Cons are fun, especially worldcon; that's what they are all about.  Reading, panel discussions, the art show, the dealers' room, the masquerade, filksinging... all sorts of great stuff goes on.  Something for all tastes.  And EVERYONE is welcome, despite what you have heard.  (Just don't be an asshole.  Assholes get welcomed too, but the welcome wears out more quickly).\r\n\r\nBoth supporting and attending members get an electronic \"Hugo packet\" that will enable you to read many of the works nominated for this year's rockets.  You should do that, no matter what side of the Puppy Wars you are on; we want informed voters.  Yes, sadly, IMNSHO this is the weakest Hugo ballot in recent memory, thanks to the Puppy slates... but there's still some damn strong work there, especially in Novel and Dramatic Presentation.  And of course it is possible that your own tastes may differ from mine.\r\n\r\nSo join, read, vote.  And fifty years from now, when your fannish grandchildren ask you, \"Say, gramps, what did you do in the Great Hugo War?\" you'll have an answer for them.","ditemid":430377,"eventtime":"2015-06-13 19:06:00","props":{"current_mood":"determined","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, politics, fandom","current_moodid":45,"commentalter":1435765749,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Hugo Voting Continues http://goo.gl/iIh1KF","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.654999820579978]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1434244066}","revtime":1436235235},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-06-14 01:06:35","anum":41,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html","event_timestamp":1434222360,"reply_count":68,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21787177#t21787177","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21787177#t21787177","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21787177#t21787177","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"unsentauron","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://unsentauron.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21787177,"talkid":85106,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21787177#t21787177","article":"Mr. Martin, I truly hope that you have not fallen into the pit of despair and futility that is the social justice war.

I earnestly try to read whatever I can and wrap my brain around the massive network of SFF contestants to a long time established noble faire of passionate and talented writers, readers and awards.  I'm seeking some info that will simplify the whole thing in my own language so I can understand more than the basic amount I do which is that a group of bigoted misogynist anti social bullies saw an opportunity to \"take control\" (something like the stories they probably write) and leave a lot of cool people who try to live their lives in a \"fair\" manner, have \"respect\" for everyone and write their stories with the same theme, in the dust.<br />I loathe me a bully! I get worked up when I see a bully.  <br /><br />Honestly, just yesterday I STARTED to sign up to be a Hugo voter, after reading some disturbing blog posts and articles, I felt sick when I saw John C Wright and Vox Day on so many Ballots and decided NOT to even participate. Though I've read some of the books on the ballot, not enough so, I suck. I know. I want to HELP my team (your team George), I just feel like I'm alone here on the Internet.  Normally I'm a fairly independent thinker but for this, I need a specific community where I can ask some questions, dumb as they may be and I need some direction, otherwise I'm not comfortable by myself jumping on a boat heading out to Sea.  But imho, that's the difference between people like \"us\" and \"others\" who have no qualms gathering-up a group of people (their buddies) to pretend they care about SFF.<br />Just looking at John C Wright's face on Wikipedia makes me nauseated, let alone reading his vile comments about gay people. <br /><br />Needless to say, I'm conflicted about partaking in the Hugo voting. I don't want to see them win ANYTHING, I'm sorry. I want to be honest. But on the other hand, I find this whole thing sickening. Especially that they call themselves \"puppies\", sad, rabid, happy or stupid, I don't care, they did that with clever and deceptive design and it's as galling as they intended.<br />what to do?<br /><br />These are the titles of posts I've been reading:<br />~ most enlightening:<br />I Stand By Irene Gallo- Chuck Wendig <br />*and then these too:<br />The Revolution of Self-Righteous Dickery will Not Be Moderated<br />How Gamergate Radicals Seized Sci-Fi's Most Prestigious Awards<br />Hijacking the Hugo Awards Won't Stifle Diversity in Science Fiction<br />And Now For Something Completely Distempered 6/9<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"June 14 2015, 14:03:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"nauseating puppies","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dragonborngurl","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dragonborngurl","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"June 14 2015, 14:08:22 UTC","dname":"dragonborngurl","ctime_ts":1434290590,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21792809#t21792809","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21792809#t21792809","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21792809#t21792809","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21792809#t21792809","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21792809,"talkid":85128,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21792809#t21792809","above":21790761,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I was just wondering if there was a specific world from a specific story that you truly felt was your home. I myself connect with medieval time periods because I felt like this was the somewhat \"golden age\" for mankind.  Where we were really our \"true\" selves and man ran in tandem with nature and the \"old ways\" if you will.  There was room for everyone to be happy and healthy (in a fashion).  <br /><br />Side note: I was born in Santa Fe, so I want to thank you for your contributions to the city.  My dad is actually John Redtail (or John Freesoul, or Mereau, he's akways changing his damn name) and he was kinda big in the Native American art scene back in the late 80's/early 90's.  Was there last year, can't say there is much of a Native American art scene there anymore, and I wasn't a fan of how gentrified the Plaza is looking, but it still had it's \"enchanting\" feel!

The entire HugoGate thing came about DUE to politics, this is the bottom line for me.  The Puppy \"side\" in its entirety based their claims and grievances on the notion that writers who have been consistently winning Hugos have been of the opposite political persuasion as themselves, and that their work reflects this, and that no \"conservative\" based SciFi/Fantasy books have ever been given the time of day.  <br /><br />Is there even a shred of truth to this?  Not up to me to decide - I think there is likely a least SOME small claim to be made, but I think the \"Puppies\" need to embrace reality, and understand that a large majority of science fiction/fantasy authors and readers both, come from a more liberal place in terms of thought process, beliefs, and so forth.  This is just how it is IMO.  Is there conservative Scifi/fantasy?  Obviously, but overall, it's a smaller slice of the pie.<br /><br />I think most folks involved should embrace the horror.  Even those on the non-puppy side, the \"liberal side\" as GRRM just stated, have used terminology which bears this out.  Even George has frequently used the terms \"our side\", and \"us\", and \"we\", when describing his side of things, which gives a pretty obvious signal that he considers himself part of a certain \"side\".  So, this being the case, it should be easy for anyone to see that the two \"sides\" are essentially split over politics, the undying left and right.  Shocker, right - much like everything else in America and the free world right now.<br /><br />I thought from the beginning what the puppies did, whether they had a case or not, was a very underhanded way to go about things, and curiously is the one thing the \"right\" often accuses their opponents of doing.  A back door, quasi-ok, short cut to advantage.  If you can't convince somebody of the legitimacy of your argument by rational means, then it isn't worth arguing in the first place.  The puppies dismissed this notion right out of the gate.<br /><br /><br />What I feel a better course of action would have been, would have been to embrace what GRRM has somewhat alluded to - understand that there IS two sides, a left and right.  Regardless if you're left, and believe the whole notion behind puppygate is nonsense and without merit, or if you're right and a puppy, and certain you have a just cause worth fighting for (even dirty fighting), circumventing an existing, long standing, and respected award, and drawing so much negative press towards it, is NOT a solution.  <br /><br />What I'm getting at is the Puppies, in all the variations, should start their own award and process.  Embrace the horror - again. The Hugos have more left leaning authors.  Start a new award that focuses on more right leaning authors.  Let the fans sort it out.  GRRM recently gave advice to a new writer here, saying not to worry about minutiae and such - the fans will sort themselves out.  They would in this case as well.  <br /><br />I explained this idea to a friend;  Star Trek is a progressive idea.  I won't call it liberal, but certainly progressive.  If it didn't have this progressive nature written into each episode and film, then it wouldn't be Star Trek, as the first season established the nature of the franchise for the future.  Is it not the same with the Hugos?  I'm sure some folks thought Star Trek was too \"left\", and wanted to see something different.  Well, that came along did it not?  People created other shows, books, stories, and films that are great examples of more \"conservative\" sci fi.  What those who created these things did NOT do is start a campaign against Star Trek, trying to undermine and change it to their point of view - they went out and created what THEY and what fans with THEIR ideas and beliefs wanted to see.  <br /><br />The fans worked it all out.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"June 15 2015, 21:07:13 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gman109","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gman109","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"June 15 2015, 21:10:07 UTC","dname":"gman109","ctime_ts":1434402433,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123692389/50421741","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21855017#t21855017","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21855017#t21855017","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21855017#t21855017","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dragonborngurl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21855017,"talkid":85371,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21855017#t21855017","above":21805353,"upictitle":"L’esprit de l’escalier: pic#123692389","article":"I could not agree with your statement more gman109!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"June 18 2015, 19:41:35 UTC","parent":21805353,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dragonborngurl","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dragonborngurl","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dragonborngurl","ctime_ts":1434656495,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116095715/38638606","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21805865#t21805865","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21805865#t21805865","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21805865#t21805865","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21805865#t21805865","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mirhaxa","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mirhaxa.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21805865,"talkid":85179,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21805865#t21805865","upictitle":"mirhaxa: hogwatch","article":"But some are shy.

I really hope not because I intend to enter the RITAs next year for my historical paranormal romance (and let me tell you, the categorizing for such a mixed genre is difficult on the forms. Apparently I have to pick one or the other).<br /><br />Awards aside, a tragedy in the romance genre has come to light. One of the people in charge of one of the biggest romance conventions has been publicly attacking another respectable convention, and as an author, I feel extremely uncomfortable and conflicted. Will I receive censure for attending one or the other of the events? The whole point is to meet and connect with readers.<br /><br />For the time being I do not plan on attending either until the dust settles, but I am still perplexed at such hostility in an environment that is supposed to celebrate the genre and its readers and writers.<br /><br />I mean, it would be like the SFWA and Worldcon attacking each other. (Please tell me that doesn't happen!)<br /><br />I apologize for the rant, my whole point is that fiction conventions and awards are supposed to celebrate their respective genres. Not to generate hostility or exclude or tear others down. <br /><br />Thank you so much, George, for your reasonable and encouraging posts on the Hugos and reminding everyone why they exist.

If you look through File770 every day, you'll see toward the bottom of the roundup, a variety of people's evaluations of the various nominees and, sadly, they are predictable evaluations.  They are either outright dismissals or they are flatly hostile to the works.<br /><br />And this is not meant to impugn their ethics.  I am sure that many went into reading them with the best of intentions at heart, but like I said, it's nearly impossible for them to be objective.<br /><br />It's like asking someone from the right to read 'If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love' or 'Redshirts' objectively.  Frankly, it just doesn't happen because the situation causes them to regard the work with antipathy, no matter what their reaction to it might have been when reading it in a vacuum.<br /><br />They will see no worth in it, just as many on the left will never see any worth on almost everything on the Puppy Slate because those works are now tinged with emotional hurt.  Those on the right are emotionally hurt because they felt for years that they were marginalized by the powers-that-be and the pillars of the community in science fiction/fantasy, while those on the left are emotionally hurt by what happened here.<br /><br />You can make an objectively plausible case for both sides.  Essentially, once liberal editors reached the highest positions of authority, (especially at TOR, where the corporate culture seems to be liberal), the most probable outcome was for them to hire like-minded first readers.  When culling the slush, those first readers were attracted by a certain type of fiction and tended to send it up more often. Over the course of time, even military and hard science fiction, long one of the few remaining holdouts where conservative outlooks tended to dominate, was infiltrated by work like Old Man's War and Ancillary Sword.  This is not to say that either of those works is bad.  Quite the contrary, both are quite good.  But the existence of each of them in the very heart of what the 'old school' milsf fans considered their bailiwick indicated that they were quite close to being pushed out of the field entirely.<br /><br />Is that a fair assessment?  Is it a fair suspicion?  Who knows?<br /><br />What we do know is that the perception of marginalization they feel is real.  And because they feel it to be real, it's no small wonder that the knee-jerk reaction towards work they regarded as emblematic of what was being done to them was completely negative and total. Of course, 'If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love' was worthless, because anything that is contributing to driving my tribe out of what I've loved forever is worthless.<br /><br />So there was never an objective reading from the right for any of these works.  Combine that with the relatively frivolous nature of 'Redshirts' when it won, with the implication that people were supposed to accept this work as being comparable to works like 'Flowers for Algernon' and 'Dune,' and the notion that in addition to the organic movement of the publishing industry to the left, there was also a more directed, background system in place to get even the lesser works of left-wing, (and TOR), authors these awards.  Again, none of this might be true, but important thing is that they believed it was real, which was why the work was never given a fair reading.<br /><br />The same thing is happening here. There may be nothing on this slate that is comparable to 'Flowers for Algernon' or 'Dune' either, but I would submit that if we've established that 'Redshirts' is a work worthy of a Hugo, there are definitely works in every category that are comparable to it.  But I am not reading all of this with the heart of someone who is wounded.  I do not have the emotional investment in any of it of either the left or the right.<br /><br />My only real interest is whether the award can ever be salvaged and my unfortunate conclusion right now, based mainly on the reaction of the left, (because let's face it, the attitudes of the right in this case are far more entrenched and the reactions of the left are newer), is no, it won't happen.  People's ideological filters are so high now that an objective reading from either side is probably impossible for the foreseeable future.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"June 16 2015, 15:15:04 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Objectivity in judging this year&#39;s nominations is likely impossible","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://michaeltho.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"michaeltho","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"michaeltho","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://michaeltho.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"michaeltho","ctime_ts":1434467704,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/104879/73175","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21821481#t21821481","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21821481#t21821481","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21821481#t21821481","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21821481#t21821481","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dexfarkin","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dexfarkin.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21821481,"talkid":85240,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/430377.html?thread=21821481#t21821481","above":21814057,"upictitle":"Dex: me","article":"<i>You can make an objectively plausible case for both sides.</i><br /><br />This is a strawman that has been propped up since the beginning and it is most poorly used by those making 'a pox on both houses' arguments like yours. There is only one 'side' - a coordinated group of self-identified allies calling themselves the Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies. The rest are individual reactions from individual members of the SFF community regarding the actions of the SP/RP side.<br /><br />Predictably, some people have flat out said that if it is on a slate, it should be automatically be disqualified for not getting nominated through the traditional process. Predictably, some people grit their teeth and said while they hate the way the system was gamed, they'll do their best to give the works a chance. Predictably, some people found the entire exercise to be an offensive campaign rooted to a sexist and racist assertions that previous Hugo winners only got their awards because they were women or people of colour and took offense to it. And predictably, there were a hundred other combinations and varying levels of response.<br /><br />Lots of people have been flinging insults. But lots of people have also been making honest efforts. If the reviews come off poorly, it's because the reviewer feels that they're looking at substandard work that clearly didn't make the ballot on its own merit. Being nominated for a Hugo means you're going to draw readers and reviewers from outside your established zones and some of them are going to approach the work from a different perspective. That's always been the case and has never been an issue from either end of the fandom ideological scope.
