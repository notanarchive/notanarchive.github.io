{"itemid":111,"subject":"The Big Tuna","event":"ESPN reports that Bill Parcells has signed with the Miami Dolphins to take over as their new director of football operations.\r\n\r\nThat sound you hear is me grinding my teeth.  Why the hell couldn't the Tuna have signed with the Falcons, as he appeared to be on the cusp of doing just two days ago?\r\n\r\nI loved Parcells as the Giants coach.  I loved him as the Jets coach.  I hated it when he walked away from both teams.  And I got really pissed when he went over to the enemy and rebuilt the Cowboys.  And now he's going to do the same thing for the Fins.\r\n\r\nThings just got that much harder for my poor Jets.  Belichick and Parcells both in the same division.
