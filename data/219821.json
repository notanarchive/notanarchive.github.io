{"itemid":858,"subject":"The Pointy End","event":"Yes, tonight is the episode I scripted for GAME OF THRONES -- episode eight, \"The Pointy End.\"\r\n\r\n(The first episode to have a title, FWIW.  I argued strongly in favor of episode titles, rather than just numbers).\r\n\r\nNo, I haven't seen it yet.  I'll be seeing it for the first time tonight, same as you folks.\r\n\r\nMany of you will want to comment afterward, I know.  Again, the best place for that discussion is not here.  Head over to Winter Is Coming, to Westeros, to Tower of the Hand, to Television Without Pity, to the HBO boards.\r\n\r\nIn a series like this, scenes sometimes get moved from episode to episode, so not everything you'll see tonight will be mine(except in the sense that is all based on my books, of course).  F'rinstance, the bit in the previews, with Tyrion and Bronn in the Mountains of the Moon, that was originally meant to be in episode seven, and was moved into \"The Pointy End\" during editing.  So that scene, and the encounter with the clansmen, was written by David and Dan.\r\n\r\nKind of fitting that \"The Pointy End\" airs even as I am working on my season two script, \"Blackwater.\"  A much tougher assignment, by the way.  All those damned boats...","ditemid":219821,"eventtime":"2011-06-05 12:30:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of

Having said that, I also appreciate close attention to particular details from the book. This is why I believe The Lord of the Rings made such spectacular screen adaptations; through adding some new scenes, changing old ones, removing some, and translating some almost word for word, a compelling trilogy of movies was made (as opposed to Hary Potter...but I'll not concern myself with that for now).<br /><br />So far, this is what I have enjoyed about your Game of Thrones TV show. As a long time avid reader of your Song of Ice and Fire series (and anxious awaiter of the upcoming fifth installment), I have enjoyed seeing many of my favorite scenes from the book appear in some form on screen, as well as enjoying many new ones from the perspectives of characters I was never able to read about intimately.<br /><br />This brings me to my question - Have you included any new scenes in your script, and have you edited any of the book's dialogue to make it more suited for the new medium?<br /><br />I of course understand if you are too busy writing one of your many upcoming projects to answer back.
