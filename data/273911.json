I didn't realize just how important this is to me until recently. I listen to A LOT of audiobooks on the job. I started a fantasy trilogy someone suggested to me that shall remain nameless, and had to stop listening halfway through the second book. All of the women in the stories were written the same- one-dimensional, nagging and over-emotional. It told me a lot about the author and his real life relationships. Hahaha! I just couldn't take it anymore! <br /><br />But it DID make me appreciate how insanely WELL you write your characters (male AND female alike). There is so much depth and complexity to each an every one... they feel almost real. You feel like you know them. (Which I imagine is why the words can actually draw tears when characters die... that's not an easy thing to accomplish, at least not where I am concerned. Haha).<br /><br />Anyways... long story short- Thank you for being awesome. ;)<br /><br />(and I'm about to dive into some inhumane overtime hours on 'ol Ender's Game... so if you have any book series you love and could recommend (I've done everything with your name on it more times than I can count, hahaha) I'd be more than eager to give them a listen.
