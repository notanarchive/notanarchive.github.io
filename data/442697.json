{"itemid":1729,"subject":"The NFL Returns","event":"The NFL is back.  Was I ready for some football?\r\n\r\nAh... er... not really.  The season somehow snuck up on me.  Too busy, I guess.  I only managed to watch one preseason game, hardly paid any attention at all, and suddenly the first game was upon us.\r\n\r\nThe Jets were pretty impressive, thumping the Cleveland Browns and Johnny Football.\r\n\r\nThe Giants... oh, ghod, what can I say?  That loss to the hated Cowboys was excruciating.  I can't deny that Tony Romo was brilliant on that final game-winning drive, especially in the absence of Dez Bryant... but Dallas did not win the game.  It was given to them.  First by the ref, who made an absolutely bogus pass interference call that resulted in a Cowboy touchdown.  And then by Eli Manning, who lost track of the Dallas timeouts and actually told Rashad Jennings not to score when the G-Men had the ball on the Dallas one, first and goal, with under two minutes left.  \r\n\r\nOne timeout, two timeouts, does it matter?  Jennings gets that ball in, the game is over.  A TD there makes it a 10-point game, and the Cowboys would not have had time enough to score twice.\r\n\r\nTalk about shooting yourself in the foot.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Giants D and the Jets O both looked better than anticipated.  \r\n\r\nI do wonder if the G-Men can bounce back from a gut-wrenching loss like that.  One that they inflicted on themselves.","ditemid":442697,"eventtime":"2015-09-15 10:24:00","props":{"current_mood":"aggravated","current_location":"Santa
