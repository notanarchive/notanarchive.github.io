{"itemid":1120,"subject":"Coming to Chicago","event":"Leaving for Chicon TOMORROW, so I figured I'd bump this one back up to the top.\r\n\r\nShould be a great con!  See you there, boys and girls.\r\n===================================================================\r\n\r\nWorldcon is coming up soon: Chicon 7, to be held in Chicago over Labor Day Weekend (worldcon's traditional weekend, where it AND IT ALONE belongs).  I'll be there.  Hell, I've only missed one worldcon in the last thirty years.  Of course I will be there.\r\n\r\nJust finished nailing down the details of my programming at the con.  \r\n\r\nHere's where you will find me:\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY August 30\r\n   3:00 - 4:30 pm   autographing, dealer's room\r\n\r\nFRIDAY August 31\r\n   1:30 - 3:00 pm   autographing, dealer's room\r\n   4:30 - 6:00 pm   WILD CARDS panel, Crystal A\r\n\r\nSATURDAY September 1\r\n   12:00 - 1:30pm   GAME OF THRONES discussion w/ Mo Ryan of THE HUFFINGTON POST,\r\n                                                      Columbus EF\r\n    3:00 - 4:30pm   SECRET HISTORY OF SCIENCE FICTION panel w/ Resnick, Dozois, Silverberg,\r\n                                                      Crystal B\r\n\r\nSUNDAY September 2\r\n     1:30 - 3:00pm  reading from THE WINDS OF WINTER, Columbus EF\r\n     8:00 pm         HUGO AWARDS, Hyatt Regency Grand Ballroom\r\n\r\nMONDAY September 3\r\n     1:30 - 3:00pm  autographing, dealer's room\r\n\r\nOf course, I will also be found partying in the evenings.  Look for the Brotherhood Without Banners bash.  It will be the best party at the con, it always is.  If I'm not there, I likely will be soon.  I will also be at the Hugo Loser's Party and Keith's chili party, but you probably can't get into those... the BWB parties are open.  And if Kansas City throws a bid party (I expect they will), I will be there too.\r\n\r\nCons, as I have said many a time, are a MUCH better place to meet and hang with your favorite author (or me, if your favorite isn't there) than any booksigning.\r\n\r\nDo please note, however: I have scheduled myself for three ninety-minutes autograph sessions, so I will be defacing books for four and a half hours at this worldcon.  If you want your book signed, come to one of those.  PLEASE do not ask me to sign outside of those scheduled events.  \r\n\r\nIf you come across me walking through the hall, visiting the art show, browsing in the dealer's room, attending a program item, leaving my panel or rushing to the next one, waiting for a cab, eating dinner, eating lunch, eating breakfast... by all means say hi, but don't ask me to sign anything.  That's what those autograph sessions are for.  \r\n\r\nAnd at parties, or in the bar, hey, by all means, come up, say hi, introduce yourself, start a conversation, offer to buy me a drink (I may or may not accept), flirt with me (I may or may not respond)... but DON'T ask me to sign stuff, okay?  And while I certainly don't mind talking about my books or the TV show, remember, I have done a thousand interviews on these subjects, and asking me about my favorite character or telling me who YOUR favorite character is will likely just send me slouching off to find someone who wants to talk about Jack Vance, sing old TV theme songs, or argue whether Sanchez or Tebow should QB the Jets.\r\n\r\n'nuff said.\r\n\r\nSee you in Chicago, I hope.","ditemid":286893,"eventtime":"2012-08-13 23:01:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"worldcon, conventions, signings","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1346796282,"current_music":"Leaving' on a Jet Plane","opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"torcon","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":4,"interface":"web","revtime":1346821118},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-08-09 05:01:21","anum":173,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/286893.html","event_timestamp":1344898860,"reply_count":58,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/87531823/18321514","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/286893.html?thread=16287661#t16287661","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/286893.html?thread=16287661#t16287661","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/286893.html?thread=16287661#t16287661","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"booksforfood","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://booksforfood.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16287661,"talkid":63623,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/286893.html?thread=16287661#t16287661","upictitle":"booksforfood: pic#87531823","article":"I'll be there!
