{"itemid":1722,"subject":"A Night of Comedy and Magic with Joel Ward - Presented by Jean Cocteau Cinema","event":"Ogre Jenni here - yes &quot;Ogre&quot; <i>is</i> my awesome job title. Nice to meet you!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Cocteau Cinema</a>, our lovely little cinema in Santa Fe, proudly welcomes comedian and magician <a href=\"http://www.joelward.com\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Ward</a> to our stage on Friday, September 11th and Saturday, September 12th. You can find out specific showtimes and purchase tickets <a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/event/joel-ward-magician/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/event/joel-ward-magician/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/270231/270231_600.jpg\" title=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe<i> love </i>magic shows at the Cocteau, and we seek out a variety of magicians with unique personalities and theatrical stylings. Take some of our previous magic shows for example. The Amazing Misty Lee brought a spooky Victorian elegance to her seance-themed performances, and Francis Menotti&#39;s magic possessed intellectual, surreal, and art historical qualities. This time around, we have a stage thief named Joel Ward. Think &quot;Vegas!&quot; We&#39;re pretty sure that stars and beautiful ladies sparkle around his head at all times. Joel&#39;s act is flashy, funny, and <i>incredibly</i> polished. His &quot;prestidigitations&quot; (commonly known as &#39;sleight of hand&#39;) are simply awe-inspiring. No dumb ol&#39; quarters will be pulled from behind people&#39;s ears&mdash;try flocks of flaming doves or sequined assistants (chopped in half or whole&mdash;we don&#39;t know.)\r\n\r\nOkay, I can&#39;t absolutely promise flocks of <i>flaming </i>doves or portions of sequined assistants, but I <i>can</i> promise plenty of audience participation. And regular magical doves. In other words, expect nothing short of perfection. *\r\n\r\nA little bit about Joel Ward:\r\n\r\nJoel was a World Champion Teen Magician by age 15, and he placed 1st at the International Brotherhood of Magicians annual competition, which is the World&rsquo;s Largest Magic Organization. He performs hundreds of shows per year, and he has been featured on the <i>Bonnie Hunt Show</i>, <i>The Masters of Illusion</i>, and for the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus show, <i>Boom A Ring</i>. He has also made appearances on <i>The Tonight Show </i>with Jay Leno and on Comedy Central&#39;s <i>Tosh.0</i>. In other words, he&#39;s kind of a big deal.\r\n\r\nWatch the highlight reel below for a taste of what Joel Ward will bring to the Cocteau! See you there!\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"598\"/>\r\n\r\n* <i>No regular magical doves or sequined assistants will be harmed during Joel Ward&#39;s performances.</i>","ditemid":440883,"eventtime":"2015-09-04 13:07:00","props":{"current_mood":"HUNGRY FOR HUMAN FLESH","current_location":"My Lair","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, comedy, joel ward, magic","commentalter":1441820931,"current_music":"The Cries of My Lunch","opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"A Night of Comedy and Magic with Joel Ward - Presented by Jean Cocteau Cinema http://goo.gl/Ot1LdH","picture_keyword":"pic#125379682","opt_screening":"F","revnum":6,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.571399940403055]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1441307329}","revtime":1442092267},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-09-03 19:07:53","anum":51,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html","event_timestamp":1441372020,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22558771#t22558771","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22558771#t22558771","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22558771#t22558771","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3291159","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/105161585065411714797","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22558771,"talkid":88120,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22558771#t22558771","upictitle":"Ruud van Oorschot: pic#0","article":"Now I worry for the safety of nonregular magical doves, nonmagical doves and nonsequined assistents participating in what looks like some awesome performances.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"September 3 2015, 19:49:23 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Joel Ward and risk of harm","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/105161585065411714797","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Ruud van Oorschot","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3291159","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76759917&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Ruud van Oorschot","ctime_ts":1441309763,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124826640/7890785","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22559027#t22559027","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22559027#t22559027","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22559027#t22559027","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"desert_dragon42","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://desert-dragon42.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22559027,"talkid":88121,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/440883.html?thread=22559027#t22559027","upictitle":"Desert Dragon: default selfie","article":"I'm going to have to move to Santa Fe so I can spend all of my weekends at the Cocteau.
