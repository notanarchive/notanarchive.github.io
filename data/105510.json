After pacing around the house with no particular objective, I sat down and watched this hokey movie.

As Gorgo mauled the small vessel, my water broke and I understood why I was restless. (So much for the pain I was supposed to feel! Although it began soon enough after.) I was soon off to the hospital to give birth to my treasure. I always wondered what the name of the movie was. Now I know. My son loves the story about the night he was born. This is only a small part of that eventful night. I often tease that some of the monster's spirit traveled with us to the hospital and is now alive within him. ;-) Who would have thought I'd find the name of that movie here...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"September 5 2009, 18:28:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Thanks!
