I'd read the books long before I saw the show.

I guess when people from Lorath try to speak the common tongue of Westeros they have the equivalent of German accents. <br /><br />Then again, the way you phrased that response may just mean that Cersei's line about Shae being from Lorath may have just been something added by David and Dan and not in your original script, in which case yes, I'd have to ask them.

Now, I speak German only moderately well, so I can't be sure of this. But, for instance, in my country, the title of the movie was translated to my first language (Serbian) as \"Glavom u zid\" - literally \"(hit your) head against the wall\". This idiom means to act in a direct, uncompromising and perhaps reckless way, possibly getting in open conflict with those around you/society/authority, without caring about the consequences. This is far more similar to the meaning of the English idiom \"head on\" than to the meaning of \"being up against the wall\". Going by the fact that both the English and the Serbian translations of the title more or less match, and that they make a lot of sense in the context of what happens in the movie and the characterization of the two protagonists, I'd guess that the meaning of the German title is pretty much the same, and that the non-literal English title is correct.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 14 2014, 13:46:17 UTC","parent":19830095,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Head On?
