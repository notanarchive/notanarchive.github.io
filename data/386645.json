{"itemid":1510,"subject":"Home From the Apple","event":"Amazing week back east.\r\n\r\nThanks to our friends at HBO, we got to see Alan Cummings in CABARET.&nbsp; Incredible.&nbsp; The movie is an all time favorite of mine, but this was the first time I&#39;ve seen it live on stage.&nbsp; Hard to believe anyone could equal the performance of Joel Grey as the emcee, but Cummings does it... thought his take is very different.&nbsp; We had great seats too.&nbsp; A night to remember.\r\n\r\nNext day I took off to Providence with Tom Doherty, for an evening at Brown University, where both of us were honored with their new literary award.&nbsp; I have passed through Providence dozens of times on the Acela, travelling from Boston to NYC, but this was the first time I got off the train.&nbsp; It&#39;s a beautiful city, though, and the Brown campus is gorgeous.&nbsp; For those of you were not able to attend, here&#39;s a video:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"497\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;My thanks to the good folks at Brown, and all the students who attended the event and the reception afterwards (which was great fun, albeit too short).&nbsp; While in Providence, I also got to visit the grave of H.P. Lovecraft... who, sadly, failed to rise from the dead to greet us.\r\n\r\nThen it was back to New York, with a brief stop in New Haven for pizza.&nbsp; This trip we tried Modern Apizza, which has its fans.&nbsp; Pretty good, I thought, but not as good as Frank Pepe&#39;s.\r\n\r\nCome the weekend, I spent Saturday with my family in Bayonne.&nbsp; On Sunday, we had tickets to the Jets game.&nbsp; The horror, the horror.&nbsp; What can I possibly say about the Jets game?&nbsp; The Jets turned over the ball six times.&nbsp; Could have been eight, but they recovered two of their own fumbles. Geno Smith threw three interceptions in the first quarter alone.&nbsp; Geno is hopeless.&nbsp; Rex finally went with Michael Vick, who was better... but Vick is not the answer either.&nbsp; He&#39;s on the downside of his career.&nbsp; Rex should give Matt Simms a shot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I miss Sanchez.&nbsp; I miss Chad Pennington.&nbsp; I miss Joe Willie Namath.&nbsp; Anyway, it was a painful morning, made worse by the fact that we seemed to be sitting among the Buffalo fans, all of them cheering wildly every time the Jets screwed up.&nbsp; (That being said, two of the Buffalo fans were fans of mine.&nbsp; They said hello when I finally gave up and got up to flee... and refrained from pouring salt in my wounds, which was very kind of them).\r\n\r\nSunday night was much better.&nbsp; That was the big event at the 92nd Street Y to launch THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE.&nbsp; A full house, and all of them went home with a copy of the book.&nbsp; Here&#39;s the video for that one:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.livestream.com/92Y/GeorgeRRMartinLive\r\n\r\nOn our last day, I appeared on LATE NIGHT with Seth Meyers, which was a hoot and a half, especially since Amy Poehler was there as well.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"501\" />\r\n\r\nOf course, I also signed a thousand books, did interviews with New York magazine, the Wall Street Journal, Al-Jazeera America, and George Stephanopoulos, had dinner with my editors and publishers at Bantam, lunch with HBO, some Papaya King dogs with X-Ray and Mr X, breakfasts with friends from DC Comic, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Simon &amp; Schuster...\r\n\r\nAnd while I was there, I had not one but TWO new books come out, and immediately hit the bestseller lists.\r\n\r\nWeeks like that don&#39;t come very often.\r\n\r\n(Nonetheless, as always, it is great to be back in Santa Fe.&nbsp; Coming back to New Mexico is always a joy).","ditemid":386645,"eventtime":"2014-10-31 00:22:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"home again","taglist":"publishing, world of ice and fire, travels, interviews","current_moodid":15,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1414968444,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Home From the Apple http://j.mp/1tY3mVv","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1415580837},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-10-31 06:21:19","anum":85,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/386645.html","event_timestamp":1414714920,"reply_count":15,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123538618/71218822","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/386645.html?thread=19673685#t19673685","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/386645.html?thread=19673685#t19673685","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/386645.html?thread=19673685#t19673685","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2628614","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/hawaii5bro","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19673685,"talkid":76850,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/386645.html?thread=19673685#t19673685","upictitle":"Hawaii5Bro: pic#123538618","article":"I too am from North Jersey (Elizabeth!
