{"itemid":1659,"subject":"No On NO AWARD","event":"No, I am not saying don't use NO AWARD at all when you vote for this year's Hugo Awards.\r\n\r\nNO AWARD has been, and remains, a viable and legitimate option for the Hugo voter.  I've been voting on the Hugos since the 1970s, and I use NO AWARD every year, usually in about a third of the categories.  However, I have seldom (not NEVER, just seldom) placed it first.  I rank the finalists that I think worthy of the rocket above NO AWARD, and the ones I think unworthy below it.  That's the way I intend to use the option this year as well, in spite of the slatemaking campaigns that buggered the nomination process to the seven hells and back.\r\n\r\nNO AWARD is a scalpel, not a bludgeon.  Voting NO AWARD on everything down the line... or even (the lesser option) on everything that appeared on either Puppy slate... well, I don't think it is smart, I don't think it is fair, and I know damned well that a NO AWARD sweep will kill the Hugos.\r\n\r\nI think I have made my disagreements with Larry Correia and Brad Torgersen and the rest of the Sad Puppies abundantly clear in the many blog posts that preceded this one, and in my debates with Correia both here and on his MONSTER HUNTER NATION.  And I think I have made my disgust with Vox Day and his Rabid Puppies clear as well.  No one should be in any doubt as to where I stand on all this.\r\n\r\nAs much as I am opposed to what the Puppies did, and what they are trying to do, I am also opposed to Guilt by Association.  Like it or not, the ballot is the ballot, and it is before it now, for each of us to deal with as he or she thinks best.  For my part, that means it is now about the stories, the books, the work itself.  Reading, thinking, weighing my choices... voting.\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell you who to vote for.  I am not even going to tell you who I am going to vote for (with one exception, which I will get to in a later post).  But I do intend to share some of my thoughts and opinions here as I go through the process.  The Puppies bark and yelp about it all being about the work, but you may notice that they never actually TALK about the work (well, except to attack REDSHIRTS and That Infamous Dinosaur Story [which, it should be noted, did not even win the Hugo]).  It is all SJWs and CHORFs and secret cabals over in Puppyland.  But over here, I think it's time to discuss the things the Hugo Awards are actually supposed to be about: writing, editing, drawing and painting, fanac...\r\n\r\nLet me start with some easy categories.  \r\n\r\nBEST FAN ARTIST.  This is the only category that is one hundred percent Puppy-free.  I guess, not really being part of fandom, they don't get any fanzines, so they didn't know any fan artists.  Whatever the reason, neither the Sads nor the Rabids threw up any candidates here.  Which makes this, to my mind, the clearest refutation of the nuclear option.  Do you really want to make these artists collateral damage?  There is no possible reason to vote NO AWARD in this category, unless you honestly feel that none of the finalists is worthy of a Hugo.  I don't feel that way, so I will be voting for the Fan Artists I like best.  \r\n\r\nBEST PROFESSIONAL ARTIST.  Ah, now this one is harder.  The ballot here consists of Julie Dillon, last year's winner, and four Puppy nominees.  I met Julie for the first time just last month at Norwescon, where we were both guests.  She seemed like a very nice person, and I already knew she was a very talented artist.  Talented enough to win two Hugos in a row?  In the past, this particular category has often been dominated by popular artists who put together long, long, LONG winning streaks (Freas, Whelan, Eggleston).  Is Julie Dillon going to be the next?  Maybe, maybe not.  If she were contending against Donato Giancola, John Picacio, Dan Dos Santos, Michael Komarck, Marc Simonetti, John Jude Palencar, and some of the other top artists who have won (and lost) Hugos in years past, I'd rate her chances of repeating about 50/50... I mean, she's good, but so are they.  But thanks to the Puppies, none of them are on the ballot this year.  Instead Julie Dillon is facing four artists that I've never heard of.  Which is sort of curious, because I follow SF and fantasy art very closely.  I check out the art shows at every con I go to (and buy art there), I read SPECTRUM religiously as soon as it comes out, I have a gallery of my own at my theatre, and I love illustrated books, comics, calendars, so I'm always looking for new artists.  The Sad Puppies went in saying they wanted to put some new names on the ballot... hey, got to hand it to them, they did that here.  Anyway, I've checked out the artwork of the four Puppy artists as best I can, via websites, Deviant Art, Google, and similar searches.  I urge all of you to do the same.  Then come back and tell me what you think.  As for me... I will be using NO AWARD in this category, but not for first place.  There is an artist here who is more than worthy of a Hugo.\r\n\r\nMoving along...\r\n\r\nThe two DRAMATIC PRESENTATION categories -- Long Form (for movies, mostly) and Short Form (for television episodes, mostly) -- are another case in point where voting a straight NO AWARD ticket would be idiotic.  Yes, four of the five nominated movies and three of the five nominated TV episodes appeared on one or the other of the two Puppy slates.  But I can assure you, from a couple of decades laboring in the vineyards of Hollywood, that there are very few people at any of the studios and networks who even know what the Hugos are, much less the Sad Puppies.  I doubt that any of them ever knew they were on anybody's slate.  Some of them don't even know they are nominated.  Voting NO AWARD over GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY or INTERSTELLAR because the Puppies liked it too gives Correia, Torgersen, and Vox Day power over your choices that is altogether unwarranted.  It's just stupid.  Vote for the movies you liked best.  Vote for the TV shows you liked best.  If there are some you don't think Hugo-worthy, rank them under NO AWARD.  Looking at any of the Dramatic Presentations as part of any Puppy slate is hallucinatory.\r\n\r\nThere are also two categories for EDITOR -- Long Form (for books, mostly) and Short Form (for magazine editors, anthology editors, and the like).  Vox Day is nominated in both of them, which is a testament to how successful the Rabid Puppies were in getting out their vote, since he was not on the Sad Puppies slate, and I cannot imagine that a single trufan wrote in his name.  If any further proof was required that the Rabids were more interested in \"blowing up the heads of the SJWs\" than in rewarding good work, well, look no further.  The other Long Form finalists are Toni Weisskopf (Baen), Anne Sowards (Ace/ Roc/ Penguin), Sheila Gilbert (DAW), and Jim Minz (Baen).  Please note that there are no editors from Tor nominated.  Tor editors have dominated Long Form Editor for most of the category's existence, but this year, it would seem, the Puppies chucked them out. (For some reason, the Puppies seem to hate Tor, despite the fact that Tor publishes a number of their favorite writers).  Aside from the exclusion of Tor and the inclusion of Vox Day, this is a solid list, however.  Yes, all of these nominees appeared on one or the other of the Puppy slates... but we now know that at least two of them were slated without their knowledge or consent (we don't know either way about the other two).  All four are long-time industry professionals who have done excellent work.  None of them have ever won a Hugo.  Some commenters have asked how they can possibly evaluate the work of an editor, since they don't know what they started with.  Fair point.  We can only judge by the end results.  Look at what DAW published last year, at what Baen published, at what Penguin published.  Vote for the editor who gave us the most good books.  I will be voting in this category as well.  \"Puppy taint\" or no, I am not willing to throw four good people under the bus called NO AWARD.\r\n\r\nShort Form Editor is a bit more problematic.  The nominees here are all from the Puppy slates too.  Edmund Schubert of ORSON SCOTT CARD'S INTERGALACTIC MEDICINE SHOW has withdrawn (see his statement in one of my earlier posts).  That leaves anthologist Bryan Thomas Schmidt, anthologist Jennifer Brozek, and Mike Resnick, editor of GALAXY'S EDGE magazine and a seasoned anthologist himself.  Resnick has been nominated for many many Hugos in the past, winning some, losing more... but never before as an editor, I think.  The other two are first-time nominees.  What is curious here is the absence of the \"usual suspects,\" the editors and anthologists who have dominated this category all the way back to when it was \"Best Magazine.\"  Sheila Williams of ASIMOV'S is not here, Gordon Van Gelder of F&SF is not here, Trevor Quachri the new editor of ANALOG is not here.  No Gardner Dozois, no Ellen Datlow... all swept away by the Puppies.  It is, to be sure, nice to see some new contenders from time to time.  But you know, they used to say that to be the champ, you need to beat the champ... and this year, the champs were not even allowed in the ring, thanks to the slatemakers.  Do they despise ANALOG and ASIMOV'S and F&SF the same way they despise Tor?  No idea, you'll need to ask Correia and Torgersen.  In any case, these are the nominees we have.  Lacking any evidence to the contrary, I put Resnick, Schmidt, and Brozek in the same boat as the four legitimate Long Form editors, and I will be ranking them according to the quality of their editorial work, as best I can judge it from reading their magazines and books.  I would urge all of you to do the same.\r\n\r\nAnd that's all the categories I care to tackle right now.  It's late, and I'm tired.  But I will share more of my musings with you in the days and weeks to come.  (I still have a lot of reading to do, needless to say).","ditemid":424767,"eventtime":"2015-04-29 00:54:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1430684641,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" No On NO AWARD http://goo.gl/u7u19j","picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.709531928614943]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430290426}","revtime":1430979208},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-29 06:53:36","anum":63,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html","event_timestamp":1430268840,"reply_count":72,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124843208/75278646","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21530175#t21530175","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21530175#t21530175","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21530175#t21530175","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kakapo6","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kakapo6.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21530175,"talkid":84102,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21530175#t21530175","etime_ts":"1430297684","article":"I will be buying a supporting membership, and voting. <br /><br />So that I can vote \"No Award\" ahead of  Tedd Robert's awful essay \"Why Science is Never Settled\" in the Related Works.<br /><br />If I was still grading essays for sophomore \"History and Philosophy of Science\" I'd have given it...  well, probably a B.

I think it's a really hard category to vote in in a sensible way.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2015, 09:24:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://naath.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"naath","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"naath","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://naath.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"naath","ctime_ts":1430299489,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98776879/6496393","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21531455#t21531455","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21531455#t21531455","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21531455#t21531455","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"a_cubed","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://a-cubed.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21531455,"talkid":84107,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21531455#t21531455","upictitle":"a_cubed: pic#98776879","article":"But how do you propose to evaluate the categories like Long Form editor?

I'm still an utter newcomer to this. But what has happened with the Puppies over the last couple of years is just an example of what damage an extremist splinter can do to the greater community.<br /><br />The Puppies claim many things. They claim that Hugo nominations (and voting?) have been controlled by a cabal that is so far reaching as to silence the voice of the greater community, but at the same time is so secretive that there is no evidence of their existence, while simultaneously being so terrible that they were utterly steamrolled this year.<br /><br />As only a fraction of fandom are members of Worldcon, and that only a fraction of that nominates for the Hugos, they claim that that makes it unrepresentative. But instead of working to expand membership, they present a slate of Vote-this-way nominees<br /><br />As to the slates themselves...Here we have 2 very complementary slates, built up by people who have had a long running and cordial relationships, such that they had worked together in previous slates (i.e., Correia pushing Day's atrocious novella last year, mainly because (as he said) Satan didn't have anything published).<br /><br />Furthermore, the Rabid one is a primarily naked display of self-interest to push Day's own name and publishing house, while the Sad one claims there was an open and democratic nomination process, but given that some of the titles on the slate weren't nominated by *anyone* in the selection thread, it's patently a false claim.<br /><br />Where am I going with all this? Simply this - there may be some illustrious candidates nominated by these slates, but given the destructive tactics at play, the sheer bad faith justifications provided by the Puppies, and the signs already provided that they intend to continue on this approach, it's my belief that the slate building tactic needs to be slapped down, and slapped down HARD.<br /><br />Even a stopped clock maybe right twice a day, but that's no reason to not replace the damn batteries.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2015, 14:20:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"On Voting NO AWARD to those who got there by a slate","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001548464971","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Alternate Snowcrash","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_427590","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=34814694&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Alternate Snowcrash","ctime_ts":1430317229,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21536575#t21536575","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21536575#t21536575","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21536575#t21536575","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21536575#t21536575","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21536575,"talkid":84127,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21536575#t21536575","above":21534015,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Editors are to a great degree stewards of literature, who have a lot of trust placed in them both by writers and readers. Slate nominations are inherently bad for the publishing business, further it's not at all possible to 'just read their work and decide' considering how strongly subjective and wide scoped a decision this particular award is. One strong indication of how good an editor is, would be if they protested against something that's bad for the publishing business. So the problem becomes that accepting a slate nomination is something that someone deserving the award shouldn't do.

pic#49405660","article":"BEST PROFESSIONAL ARTIST<br /><br />Choosing between Eno or Duoponce, I'd go with Duoponce. They're both very photo-manipulation/CGI in rendering. I personally prefer paintings with rough painterly brushstrokes. But that's me - Literally different strokes for different folks here.<br /><br />Julie Dillon is amazing of course, I especially love her elemental works in 2015. High saturation and sharpness in her paintings. You can swim in aquamarine and turquoise in Sailing Laniakea. As fas as I can find, she also has the most output. (Or maybe she's the only one who keeps her site updated)<br /><br />I've always admired Alan Pollack's work. He has a strong eye for dynamic compositions and is great with warm palettes. I mean, I think anyone who is the least bit familiar with fantasy/sci-fi art the past decade would be familiar with him. I'm not sure what is new for 2015. I'm surprised he hadn't a couple noms already. Seen a lot of him from Wizards of the Coast.<br /><br />Carter Reid has a long and great career ahead of him for sure, but I don't think his work holds a candle here amongst Pollack or Dillon or Greenwood. Looking forward to more of him in the future.<br /><br />Nick Greenwood though, oh boy, I've long admired his work since college. Not quite the dynamic framing of Pollack, or the controlled chaos of saturation by Dillon. But his drawing is raw and classical. Probably the best draughtsman of any of them. If I could sit and just watch someone just draw for a day, it'd be him.<br /><br />So if I felt incredibly compelled by photo-manip/CGI art this year, I'd go for Duoponce. But I'm not. I'm not particularly in awe of Dillon - totally deserving the award but observational in contrast to the rest. It's really apples and oranges going from Dillon to Greenwood and Pollack. If you're looking for the most iconic, powerful graphics, I think Dillon would be the way to go. But if you're looking for drama, tension, storytelling in the imagery, then Greenwood and Pollack. I'd ask people to forget about the slates for a moment-- Pollack's cover art is great, not his best, but certainly engaging. They are very comic like, striking, but not a fan of it compared to his other work. Greenwood's work is very classical. (a student of renaissance art, hard not to love). His night skies would make him a great romantic landscapist in it's own right. Of course, he's already won awards for TEN WINKS TO FOREVER cover. And he doesn't have the volume that Pollack or Dillon have (I imagine partly in due to being a designer/engineer when starting out). His Ender's covers are wonderful though. The texture in the anthology cover is lovely and sets him apart from the rest of the candidates.<br /><br />This has all been a very long way of saying I have no idea who I'm going to vote for. There are so many great artists who should get nommed but don't, I hope we do see new people more often. I'll still be pushing for Raymond Swanland, Alan Lee and Marc Simonetti.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 30 2015, 18:42:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Artists","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sigard-sormr.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sigard_sormr","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sigard_sormr","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sigard-sormr.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sigard_sormr","ctime_ts":1430419375,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21560639#t21560639","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21560639#t21560639","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21560639#t21560639","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21560639,"talkid":84221,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424767.html?thread=21560639#t21560639","above":21560383,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Olson: Hiking","article":"Even if we had a 15 category No Award, it would not kill the Hugos. <br /><br />Would it damage the Hugos? Possibly. I only say possibly because the real question is \"Would it damage the Hugos *any more than they have already been damaged*?\" I think that, even if so, that extra damage is minor, but I doubt that it would. The harm has already happened. We're in recovery mode now. <br /><br />If you want to destroy the Hugos, the way is simple -- move to delete Article 3 from the WSFS Constitution, get it passed, ratify next year, and that year will be the last year the Hugos exist. That kills the Hugos. Nothing else does. ANY talk of \"killing the Hugos\" or \"Nuclear Option\" or whatnot that isn't \"deleting the article enabling the awarding of the Hugos\" is frank scaremongering. The way you kill the Hugos is remove the text in the WSFS Constitution that enables WSFS to award them.<br /><br />Sir, I've known you for years, I respect you deeply, and that's why I have to call you out for the scaremongering. <br /><br />We put No Award in decades ago for a reason -- if the Best Whatever is not on the ballot, you vote No Award, and this is the year to use them. Once, many, maybe even all 15. No Award was the ultimate veto given in case of a nomination failure. Despite the fact we haven't needed it in almost 40 years, we never even considered removing it. It's been there on every ballot.<br /><br />__ No Award<br /><br />Why? Because someday, we might need it. Maybe for one category. Maybe for all. That's why every single category, and the Campbell, has the exact same line at the end of it. <br /><br />__ No Award<br /><br />I intend to remember why we put that at the end of every category when I vote my ballot. Everyone else should as well. And if we end up with no Hugos this year? We've had years with no Olympics.  The Nobel Prize has explicitly declared that there was nothing worthy of award if they felt nobody had made a prizeworthy contribution in one of the categories. <br /><br />The Hugos will survive this *unless* we ignore the tools that we have to deal with the nominations that are clearly not the Best X. If that's the case, then they lose all meaning, because then, well, then the way you win a Hugo is you get on the Best Slate. <br /><br />__ No Award. <br /><br />Because if the key to the Hugo is being on the Best Slate, then we need to remove Article 3 from the WSFS Constitution -- you know. The Nuclear Option. Actually *killing the Hugos*. <br /><br />I'd prefer to save them with a few well chosen No Awards.
