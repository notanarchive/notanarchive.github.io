I hope it is published so I can send to Melinda Snodgrass and you (well, that's the plan, at least), but talking about weighing in ourselves in Aces High, also talking about sources of joy in your next entry, and in case it isn't published, I take the liberty of post in some of its excerpts (The article is originally written in Spanish, so, excuse me any inconsistency in its translation):<br /><br />\"Personally, the most striking thing I find in Wild Cards is its constant reminder that not even the fictional characters can escape that karma that gnaws the existence. Every action has a consequence and not even the most advanced superhero can avoid this inexorable principle. Do you want to absorb knowledge? Careful, someone absorbed the personalities of Julius Robert Oppenheimer (...) She had a brilliant mind, but ended up forgetting who she was(...) Maybe you can still remain anonymous if you can lift objects (...) But ... you still need a regular job, and to fall in love, and to have a family, at what time do you plan to save the world? It is better to cast away the woman of your life with some mediocre excuse because you do not have the time to do everything! Oh! You could freeze time! However, have you been freezing it lately? Last week you were forty years old and today you look like sixty years old.<br /><br />Therefore, if you are one of those who still keeps a comic under the bed, or one of those who wake up scared because, at his thirties, you dreamed of saving ladies in trouble, do not worry. Just as the children have their Spiderman, their Batman and their Aquaman, we can have our Great and Powerful Turtle, our Croyd Crenson and our Fortunato (...)<br /><br />I invite you to read this work of fiction that can remove you from reality - something that is needed from time to time - but it is also able to keep you oldered to Earth like the roots of a tree to the ground. And most importantly, Wild Cards made me fly very high, as you read it, do not forget to also do it, my dear Ace”<br /><br />I hope you like it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 weeks ago","ctime":"April 19 2017, 21:25:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Talking about weighing in...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Jvargasleal","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jvargasleal","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4097829","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81750650&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jvargasleal","ctime_ts":1492637126,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533638.html?thread=26028678#t26028678","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533638.html?thread=26028678#t26028678","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533638.html?thread=26028678#t26028678","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_4098478","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/104714023325909862480","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26028678,"talkid":101674,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533638.html?thread=26028678#t26028678","upictitle":"Liyona Bonakdar: pic#0","article":"As an Iranian fan of your books, I always wondered if the rich history of Persia also had any influence in ASOIF.
