There is a D20 system (ie. based somewhat on Dungeons & Dragons edition 3.0 or 3.5 rules - not sure which, but they're very similar) version, and another version using something called the Tri-Stat Dx system if memory serves, which I have never heard of other than this.<br /><br />Note, there is also a brand new Ice & Fire RPG in the works, from Green Ronin Publishing.  According to their site, the campaign setting book is due out sometime this month, and the main rulebook is on its way as well.  There is a Quick Start rules pdf on their site for free download for anyone who wants to give it a try in the meantime.  I run a D&D game, but if I can get a few of my players to read ASoIaF I'm definitely considering trying out the Quick Start rules to see how they play - haven't yet downloaded it or checked if it comes with an introductory adventure, but that is how these Quick Start things normally work from what I've seen.  Apparently this incarnation of the game will use a custom ruleset desgined just for the ASoIaF RPG.  Anyhow, once the books come out, this one will be a lot easier to find I'd bet.  Though award-winning autographed copies of the out of print edition do seem very tempting even if further rules supplements are now out of the question...  Green Ronin definitely makes good stuff though, so IMO you can't go too far wrong in picking up either version<br /><br />Oh yeah, Dragon Magazine issue 307 also had a nice long article about gaming in Westeros, complete with some rules and stats, and a couple of suggested adventure scenarios.  There was a map too, I think.  This is how I first became aware of the series, though I forgot all about it until my sister gave me a copy of AGoT for Christmas a couple of years later.<br /><br />As for the minis, I've got all of Dark Sword's GRRM Masterworks line so far (other than the 54mm sculpts and the newest ones which I've ordered but haven't yet received) and they are absolutely fanastic.  Been collecting and painting 28mm minis for a couple of decades now and I've never seen anything so incredibly detailed and realistically proportioned as the minis Dark Sword produces.  ~$10 a pop for human-sized figures from any other miniatures company would give me pause, but I am eager to keep collecting this line even so, if that tells you anything.  Just beautiful.  Tom Meier is a legend.   ...And the Jeff Grace sculpts are none too shabby either!<br /><br />OK, enough rambling for now.

Dark Sword gives away free minis too; if you order a bunch at a time they'll usually thrown an extra mini or 2 into the box.  Takes some of the sting out of that ~$10/mini price tag, though the quality sculpts themselves make the price quite reasonable IMO.<br /><br />Also, I have begun reading the free Song of Ice & Fire RPG \"quick start\" pdf available from Green Ronin's site - the rules seem fairly simple and the game looks interesting.  I look forward to trying out the rules for running intrigues, if I can convince my D&D group to let me run the intro. adventure that comes with the pdf instead of my regular game at some point.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"July 13 2009, 19:00:49 UTC","parent":6447958,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1247511649,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?replyto=6391638","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6391638#t6391638","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6391638#t6391638","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6391638#t6391638","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thomas_thomas","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thomas-thomas.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6391638,"talkid":24967,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6391638#t6391638","upictitle":"thomas_thomas: pic#0","article":"Figures look great hope they are in fact close to 28mm, most so far are more like 30mm (of course Tyrion will be \"shorter\").<br /><br />I've noticed that all the figures with bows tend to have recurves rather than longbows.<br /><br />In the books yew longbows are mentioned several times.<br /><br />Would it be possible to get the sculpters to do longbows for the Seven Kingdoms and save the recurves for the Docktari?<br /><br />TomT","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"June 12 2009, 15:28:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Bows","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thomas-thomas.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thomas_thomas","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thomas_thomas","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thomas-thomas.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thomas_thomas","ctime_ts":1244820517,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?replyto=6396246","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6396246#t6396246","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6396246#t6396246","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6396246#t6396246","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lords_kiss","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lords-kiss.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6396246,"talkid":24985,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/91734.html?thread=6396246#t6396246","above":6391638,"upictitle":"lords_kiss: pic#0","article":"I agree, recurved bows should only be used for Dothraki-and mayhaps the goldenheart bows of the Summer Islanders and Dornish bows as well, only George would know for sure. <br /><br /> Oddly enough, the original AGoT d20 RPG also made this same mistake, so it must be a widely misconstrued idea in the RPG/Mini world.<br /><br />Not really keen on the non-Meier sculpts, Grace's style too DnD/Reaper.
