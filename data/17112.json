{"itemid":66,"subject":"a new deal for WILD CARDS","event":"I've just finished going over the copyedited manuscript of INSIDE STRAIGHT, the first book in our new Wild Cards triad, scheduled for a January release from Tor.  It's the eighteenth volume in the series, which we originally launched with Bantam way back in 1987, but it's not necessary to have read the preceding seventeen books to be able to understand and enjoy this one, so I hope that come January some of you will go out and pick it up and give Wild Cards a try.  \r\n\r\nI am, of course, prejudiced, since I edited the thing, but I think INSIDE STRAIGHT is one of the stronger volumes in the series.  This is sort of \"Wild Cards - the New Generation,\" since a lot of our original cast of characters were getting a little long in the tooth.  (Unlike the heroes of the Marvel and DC universe, the Wild Cards characters live in real time, and aside from Golden Boy and Dr. Tachyon and a few others, they age).  A few of the older, established characters will appear in INSIDE STRAIGHT, some in major roles and some just as cameos or even just mentions-in-passing, but mostly this book will belong to the new kids on the block -- Bugsy, Lohengrin, Curveball, Earth Witch, Bubbles, Rustbelt, Lilith, Drummer Boy, and a whole bunch more.  I can't wait for you guys to meet them.  I think our old Wild Cards readers will find them worthy successors to Tachyon and the Turtle and Fortunato and Yeoman and the rest of our first generations stars... and I hope our new readers will like them enough to go out and hunt up some of the old books on ABE.  \r\n\r\nINSIDE STRAIGHT will also mark the Wild Cards debuts of some terrific new writers.  Caroline Spector, Carrie Vaughn, and Ian Tregillis will all be joining the madness, and I think you'll like their stuff.  I do.  \"The Tin Man's Lament,\" Ian's story in INSIDE STRAIGHT, is his first professional sale, but I promise you, it won't be his last.  I expect to see his name turning up on the Campbell Awards ballot in a couple of years.\r\n\r\nAnd of course a bunch of our regulars will also be on hand, albeit with new characters.  One of the best things about the Wild Cards series is the opportunity it gives me to work with so many talented writers, some big names, some just starting out.  Writing for something like Wild Cards is a bit like being in a band, as opposed to doing a solo act.  Unlike musicians, we writers play solo the vast majority of the time, so it's huge fun to have the chance to jam with other people now and again... and what comes out of those jam sessions is often wild and wonderful, and quite different from anything any one member of the band could have come up with on his or her own.  \r\n\r\nOh, and I've just seen the cover for INSIDE STRAIGHT as well.  The art is by Michael Komarck, and it's spectacular.  I think this is the best cover we've ever had on a Wild Cards book.  Yes, even better than the six Brian Bolland covers that adorned the Titan editions in England, and I loved those so much that I bought five of the originals and hung them on my wall.  Komarck is a real comer as an artist, I think.  In a few years, I think you'll be seeing his name on Hugo ballots, if there is any justice (of course, there ISN'T any justice, or else Alan Lee and John Howe would both have Hugos, but that's a discussion for another day). \r\n\r\nI should also mention that, although I won't be at this year's San Diego Comicon, the Wild Cards series will be represented.  WC writers Kevin Andrew Murphy and Carrie Vaughn will be there, participating, and Tor will be doing a special INSIDE STRAIGHT promotion, so be sure and visit their booth in the exhibit hall.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, yeah, I know this post will probably infuriate those \"fans\" of mine who would prefer that I work on A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE all day, every day, to the exclusion of everything else... but I've grown used to that by now.  Sorry, guys.  I'm working on DANCE, as I've reported, but I have other projects too, and that's going to continue to be true for a long, long time.","ditemid":17112,"eventtime":"2007-06-28 17:46:00","props":{"taglist":"wild cards","commentalter":1292888668,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-06-29 01:03:43","anum":216,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17112.html","event_timestamp":1183052760,"reply_count":114,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/62211016/7595452","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17112.html?replyto=2039768","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17112.html?thread=2039768#t2039768","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17112.html?thread=2039768#t2039768","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17112.html?thread=2039768#t2039768","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"shala_beads","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://shala-beads.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2039768,"talkid":7967,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17112.html?thread=2039768#t2039768","upictitle":"shala_beads: My hands","article":"I love the Song of Ice and Fire books, but the Wild Card books have been such long time favorites of mine.

I expect to see his name turning up on the Campbell Awards ballot in a couple of years.<br /></q> <p><br />I can't wait to read Carrie Vaughn's portion of INSIDE STRAIGHT, and your fondness of Ian Tregillis's writing has me intrigued. <p><br />Everyone should give this series a shot. The first book in the original series, WILD CARDS, is a fun read, and I'm sure you'll want more. The older books are pretty easy to find in used stores, and on-line, but as G.R.R.M. has stated you don't have to read the old books to like/get the new one.

Fortunately, most of these are very easy to find.  Look in used book stores, an line at abe.com, Amazon.com, and on ebay.  The original Bantam volumes are the easiest.  Then there are three Baen volumes.  Volume 1 is tougher than any of the Bantam books.  Volume 2 is tougher than Vol. 1.  Volume 3 is very tough; if you can find it for less than $30 or so in decent condition, snap it up.  Then there are two iBooks books.  Both are available only in hardcover.  DEUCES DOWN, the first iBooks volume is scarce, but can be found if you look.  DEATH DRAWS FIVE, my novel and the last of the \"old\" wild card books is very, very hard to find.  Only a few hundred copies got out into circulation before iBooks declared bankruptcy and closed down.  A word to the wise, however.  Not all book dealers know this, and you can still get copies, used, on Amazon.com.  Get them while you can.<br /><br />Hopefully, there will be reprints some time in the future, but the iBooks bankruptcy has been quite disastrous, and it may be quite some time before all the legalities are sorted out.<br /><br />But then, when it comes to used books, half the thrill is in the hunt, right?<br /><br />If you have an interest in Wild Cards, I recommend the following message board:<br /><br /><a href='http://www.captaincomics.us/forums/index.php?board=4.0' rel='nofollow'>http://www.captaincomics.us/forums/inde<wbr />x.php?board=4.0</a><br /><br />It has a very nice Wild Card topic full of lively fans, and several wild card authors including myself and Stephen Leigh post there on a regular basis, some others on a not so regular basis.

I need to read a quality book.  I really do not want to start another of your series.  A Song of Ice and Fire is my favorite epic.  I cannot start another epic of yours because i'm afraid it'll drag out even longer then this series.  I've turned everyone of my friends onto this series and talk it up like crazy but I need closure before reading more.  You captivate me entirely, I could not put the first book down.  I probably slept 2hrs a night because I needed to know what would happen next.  No book has ever got my attention like that.  Robert Jordan came close but he was still a distant 2nd.  I want to see the new book under my christmas tree this year...please please please..  I'll be your assistant and even type for you.  So yes, I'm the nagger for the day....  hug your woman and hug your dog then hug you typewritter...and do your thing..
