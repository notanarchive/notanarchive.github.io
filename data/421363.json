{"itemid":1645,"subject":"On the Darkling Plain","event":"The longer the Puppygate Wars drag on, the more pessimistic I grow about the future of the Hugo Awards.  I started out by saying that the Sad Puppies (and their Rabid cousins) had broken them, and every day and every post and blog and story I read underlines the truth of that.\r\n\r\nMy friend Janice Gelb, long time worldcon volunteer and SMOF, has suggested that the only thing we can do at this point is abolish the Hugo Awards altogether.  When I first heard that notion, I dismissed it out of hand.  Some good will, some civility, a mutual exchange of ideas, and surely we could find a way to salvage the situation.  \r\n\r\nI am no longer convinced of that.  The Sad Puppies are digging in and doubling down, and so is worldcon fandom.  Meanwhile, off in the cesspools, the Rabid Puppies grow ever more rabid.  Nuclear options are being seriously considered, and Vox Day has apparently threatened that if NO AWARD wins in any category, he will see to it that no award is ever given in that category again.\r\n\r\nMy first inclination was to dismiss that threat as so much toxic wind.  But I am not so sure.  According to FILE 770  http://file770.com/?p=21877 there have been 1352 new Supporting Memberships purchased this month, an unprecedented number.  Very few of these purchases, I fear, were motivated by a sincere desire to support WorldCon.  No, all these new supporting members are plonking down their money for a vote on the Hugos.\r\n\r\nAh, but which side do they represent?  Are these members of traditional fandom, signing up to take back their awards?  Are these Sad Puppy supporters, anxious to vote their slate to victory?  Are these all NO AWARDers?  Or maybe these are the Vox Day fans.  Beale seems to have much more control over his followers than Correia and Torgensen do over theirs... the ballot actually has more Rabid Puppies than Sad ones.  Could it be that Vox Day has successfully roused the GamerGate bogeyman that he was been threatening us with?  No one knows.  Unless... \r\n\r\nI think it is All of the Above.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, two of this year's nominees have withdrawn their stories from contention: Marko Kloos in Best Novel, and Annie Bellett in Best Short Story.  I understand their desire to be out of this mess.  Both nominations were, pretty clearly, due to their inclusion on the Sad Puppy slate, but neither writer was actually an active participant in the slate-making.  And both were first time nominees.  I remember how much joy my first Hugo nomination brought me in 1974, and I regret that these two young writers (I do not know either one, I am not familiar with their work, and I have no idea of their political, religious, or literary convictions) will think back on their own nominations with regret and rancor, rather than fondly.  One's first Hugo nomination, like one's first sexual experience, should be a memory to treasure, not a trauma.\r\n\r\nThe flood of supporting memberships will continue, I think.  I believe one can still join (and vote) up to July 1.  Those 1300 new supporting members will become 1500... maybe 2000... maybe 3000.  Very few of whom will bother to turn up at the con.  Great news for SasQuan's bottom line.  Not so great for fandom.  For worldcon.  For SF.  More Sad Puppies may withdraw, (I doubt very much that any of the Rabid Puppies will), like Kloos and Bellett.  More presenters may withdraw, like Connie Willis.  The business meeting will be loud and long and rancorous, as all these new rules proposals are debated and voted on.  And the Hugo Awards themselves...\r\n\r\nI do not see a happy outcome here.\r\n\r\nMaybe all the new voters are Vox Day acolytes, and the Rabid Puppies will sweep the board.\r\n\r\nMaybe the NO AWARDers will carry the day, and the night will end with no Hugos given out at all.  And then Vox Day will double down next year and try to make good on his threat to make sure no more Hugos are ever given.\r\n\r\nMaybe NO AWARD will win in the All-Puppy categories (Related Work and the three Short Fiction categories), while the other rockets go to the non-Puppy nominees in split categories.  I actually thought this was the most likely outcome, until I read about the flood of new members.\r\n\r\nMaybe some awards will go to Puppies, and some to non-Puppies.  A split verdict.  I don't see this as likely at all, actually... I think those new voters are going to trend one way or another, heavily... but I supposed it could happen.  And afterward, wow, what fun getting all the winners together for the traditional \"class photograph.\"\r\n\r\nAny way the dice fall, I foresee lots of booing and hissing as the names are called out, lots of unhappy presenters, angry winners and angrier losers.  \r\n\r\nOnly one thing for certain: no matter what happens, Vox Day will declare that he's won.\r\n\r\nAnd as for me... I don't know right now.  On odd numbered days, I lean toward opting out of SasQuan entirely.  Stay home, work on the book, I don't need this grief.  On even numbered days, I am determined to go... and to go BIG.  Take the Hugo Losers Party back.  I started it, after all.  And this year, so far as the Hugos are concerned, we are all going to be losers.\r\n\r\nIt is all very depressing.\r\n\r\nFandom is supposed to be fun.","ditemid":421363,"eventtime":"2015-04-15 17:30:00","props":{"current_mood":"depressed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":9,"commentalter":1451589319,"crosspost_tw":" On the Darkling Plain http://goo.gl/OscthC","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"angry","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.669807048392171]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1429140647}","revtime":1429394516},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-15 23:30:02","anum":243,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/421363.html","event_timestamp":1429119000,"reply_count":303,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/421363.html?thread=21174515#t21174515","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/421363.html?thread=21174515#t21174515","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/421363.html?thread=21174515#t21174515","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/421363.html?thread=21174515#t21174515","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bronn_stone","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bronn-stone.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21174515,"talkid":82712,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/421363.html?thread=21174515#t21174515","upictitle":"bronn_stone: pic#0","article":"The price for non-attending membership has to go up.

Naismith: We Want YOU","article":"<br />All I can say is--I hope to see you there.  On an even-numbered day. <br /><br />I'm mostly in the filk area. If you stop by, I can either sing one of my Westeros parody songs, or promise not to do so, depending on your preference.<br /><br /><br />OK-that's not all I can say. It's occurred to me--and my outlook has brightened on the whole mess since it did--that Worldcon isn't just about Hugos.  It's also a big fat geek party with a whole lot of chances for fun, jovial friends, song, art, panels, booksignings, cosplay, games, room parties, getting to meet people one has admired from afar for years, meeting people one has never heard of who turn out to be superstars (has happened to me often; that's why I'm polite to strangers), chances to get drunk and silly, or stay sober and silly....and all these people buying SUPPORTING memberships, who might be poisoning the well--they aren't gonna be there. They're just providing the funds to make the party that much better for the people they hate.  <br /><br />Might even be worth the Hugos becoming a joke, to have that.  Or to lower the membership price and make it affordable for more members.  Call it \"sweet grapes\" if you will, but it ain't gonna be all bad.<br /><br />Finally--I've heard of times when 4chan has tried to rig contests for a prank, like the time a radio station had a \"meet Taylor swift\" promo and they tried to arrange for some creepy old guy to win the contest and be a boor while preventing any real fan who actually wanted the prize from winning.  The station reserved the right to discard ballots from suspicious sources that appeared to be for the purpose of playing a spoiler role, and that \"prank\" failed.<br /><br />I'm trying to decide if there's a way the Hugo committee could similarly have a way to winnow out spoiler votes. Plenty of potential negatives, sure:<br /><br />1. There would be accusations that doing so was rigging the vote in favor of \"Happy Kittens\" or SJWs or whatever they're calling it.  Considering that the people most likely to say so are ALREADY claiming that, it doesn't seem like much of a risk.<br /><br />2. It's possible that such a policy could open the door to REALLY rigging things, if the committee was unscrupulous. I kinda have faith and trust, but YMMV. <br /><br />3.  Some good faith ballots could be tossed by mistake.<br /><br />Still, seems better than no Hugo at all, and better than a system where hordes of Gamergate people are enabled to give us slates full of space rape porn or whatever.<br /><br />A lot of good ideas begin with brainstorming, and a lot of bad ideas can get nipped in the bud by identifying the insurmountable flaws early.<br /><br />What do YOU think?  <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 16 2015, 00:07:52

You can burn down the house, or you can welcome everyone into a different looking house... but one that is seriously re-invigorated.<br /><br />I am sure I am not the only person who was unaware of how the Hugos were voted on until Sad Puppies.  I had mentioned before, I am a big SFF fan.  A lot of my personality has been formed from the works of Tolkien, Herbert, Silverberg, Norton, McCaffery, Le Guin, and countless others.  Asimov, Clarke, Benford, and Brin have helped open my mind to areas of science that I hadn't been exposed to in school.  These have all been remarkably positive impacts in my life.  I love SFF.  I'm seriously considering a membership because the idea of voting on the Hugos is EXTREMELY exciting!  I will get a packet and have some seriously good reading material for the next few months.  How cool is that?<br /><br />I will not be the only one who has read Brad and Larry, gotten their take on it all, and then decided to join up and... you know... vote on the pieces I like (just as Larry and Brad have suggested).  I'm pretty sure my tastes will not correlate 100% with the SD slate.<br /><br />So let me ask you this... are you willing to burn down the house and spite those who join and are rabid about thsoe slates?  Or will you work to welcome the influx of new membership and give them even an ounce of respect (and a chance) to exist and vote within the framework that has been the basis of the Hugos since the award began.  Do you really want to potentially alienate what could be a vibrant new membership of people that share a love of SFF, or will you slam the door and lock it because there are those who joined up just to spite you?<br /><br />Reminds me of the finale of Dune.  When confronted with what appeared to be a stronger, more agile, and certainly more determined opponent... Paul bent like a reed.

I have read your blog for years, and have been a sci-fi and fantasy fan for most of my life.

And they made me want to be a part of the process (even if it took this unholy storm to catch my attention).<br /><br />So, I bought a supporting membership and started reading.  And I'm going to keep reading what is on the lists, and then I will vote regardless of slates, and hope that the Hugo can go on.
