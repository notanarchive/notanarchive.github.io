I have a lot of respect for Todd Bowels and know his style very well.<br />I think he is a good coach and a great guy (but alas has nothing to do with profession choices).<br />But even I can't get behind him not starting Bryce Petty sooner. Yes once in a great while, you get a Dak. But I don't think 4 games is enough to get a great feel of a young QB. I would have liked to see 6-8 games honestly. <br />4 games, if he shows flashes - that can't convince the jets not to draft (QB class looks bad in college upcoming draft) or sign a veteran QB, if he isn't that good with all the problems and issues the jets have - how can that be his fault? To me, it would be like pulling a fan fiction writer of fantasy off the street and ask him to finish your books that you are retiring to the virgin Islands to expose them to New Mexico green chili. That has to be a lot of pressure on a rookie QB<br /><br />Sorry for the ramble. Should Todd Bowels be fired? and on top of that do you think he will be? What do you think of the prospect of signing Culter or Romo next year? I don't see how that makes the Jets a playoff team next year personally.  <br /><br />I think Bowels should be fired personally. The team has stopped responding to him. I think it is time for a free approach and filter some of the older vets out.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 months ago","ctime":"December 7 2016, 09:29:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Tood Bowels?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/102152495491770476262","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Christopher Frazier","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3921638","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=79766299&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 7 2016, 09:34:25 UTC","dname":"Christopher Frazier","ctime_ts":1481102950,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121699860/66021282","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?replyto=25377125","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25377125#t25377125","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25377125#t25377125","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25377125#t25377125","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2128407","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/torome86","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25377125,"talkid":99129,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25377125#t25377125","upictitle":"Jimmy Potter: pic#121699860","article":"Someday spring will come and end the Jets' decades long winter...<br /><br />But for now let's revel in the decade-plus long summer that the Patriots are having!!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 months ago","ctime":"December 7 2016, 13:21:20 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Someday","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/torome86","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jimmy Potter","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2128407","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=66021282&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jimmy Potter","ctime_ts":1481116880,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126845153/79216737","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?replyto=25378405","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25378405#t25378405","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25378405#t25378405","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25378405#t25378405","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"underhermask","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://underhermask.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25378405,"talkid":99134,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509797.html?thread=25378405#t25378405","upictitle":"underhermask: pic#126845153","article":"Hey, at least you're not a Carolina Panthers fan.
