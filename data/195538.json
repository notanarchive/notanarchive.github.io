{"itemid":763,"subject":"Some Odds, Some Ends","event":"I miss football already.  Looking forward to the draft.  Not looking forward to months of fighting between the owners and players, and maybe a lockout/ strike.  \r\n\r\nThings are rolling along nicely on the Ice & Fire comic book.  Check out the new interview with Daniel Abraham on Suvudu:\r\n\r\nhttp://graphic-novels-manga.suvudu.com/2011/02/interview-daniel-abraham-on-grrm-comics.html\r\n\r\nSuvudu also informs me of a new round of Cage Matches, wherein Jon Snow will be one of the contestants.  Details here:  http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/02/cage-match-2011-its-coming.html\r\n\r\nI never had the chance to talk about their \"Villains\" Cage Match (too busy), in which Ser Gregor Clegane emerged victorious over a murderer's rows of nasties and narsties from screen and page.  Congratulations to the Mountain That Rides, and thanks to all of you who voted!\r\n\r\nThere's been lots of talk about ebooks and digital publishing swirling around me of late.  It's a brave new world for this old dinosaur.  Kindles, Nooks, iPads, iPods, ebooks, PODs, all confusing as hell.  But it is something that I am looking into for some of my backlist titles... some of the out of print Wild Cards books might be well received in such formats, I think.  So expect news on that front eventually, though maybe not soon.  I have this other book I'm writing, you know, and that comes first.  I can deal with putting the old wine in new bottles when that's done.\r\n\r\nThat being said, y'know, I DO have some stuff available as ebooks and downloads, for all of you who have been asking.  Check out my listings on Fictionwise and Electric Story if you would like to sample some of it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/GeorgeRRMartineBooks.htm\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dwszc/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dwszc\" width=\"123\" height=\"185\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.electricstory.com/authors/author.aspx?authorid=78\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dxg0z/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dxg0z\" width=\"152\" height=\"211\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, over in miniature town, the good folks at Dark Sword are rolling out four great new Tom Meier sculpts in their Ice & Fire range:  the Reed siblings, Meera and Jojen, and a double of Hodor (HODOR!) with Bran riding on his back.  Have a look at the greens.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dspp3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dspp3\" width=\"373\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dt7ze/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dt7ze/s640x480\" width=\"518\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe new minis should be available soon from the Dark Sword website at http://darkswordminiatures.com/  Along with the rest of the range, of course.\r\n\r\nShould also mention that Hugo nominations are now open, for members of the current worldcon (Reno) and the last one (Melbourne).  I did not have a novel out last year (some of you might have noticed that), but I am eligible to be nominated in Best Editor/ Short Form for my anthology work with Gardner Dozois, and in the novella category for \"The Mystery Knight\" from WARRIORS.  All the other stories in WARRIORS and SONGS OF LOVE AND DEATH are eligible as well.  I hope you will consider some of them when filling out your ballot; I think there was some fine work in both books, worthy of recognition.  And let me once again suggest that it is long past time that MICHAEL KOMARCK was nominated as Best Pro Artist.  His cover art for Wild Cards has been extraordinary, and he's done amazing work for other books as well.\r\n\r\nMust run now.  Kong is calling.","ditemid":195538,"eventtime":"2011-02-11 12:31:00","props":{"current_location":"at my desk","taglist":"hugo awards, nfl, anthologies, awards, miniatures, dark sword, comic books","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1297799173,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":94,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:10,31:5,33:5,37:5,23:10,42:10,32:5,16:10,3:30,25:5,19:15,4:20,26:5,20:15,9:25,13:5,nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1297975878},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-02-11 19:31:29","anum":210,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html","event_timestamp":1297427460,"reply_count":83,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020434#t12020434","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020434#t12020434","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020434#t12020434","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12020434,"talkid":46954,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020434#t12020434","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Can't say I'm looking forward to the next football season, as I'm dreading what the Dolphins are going to put me through...<br /><br />We've also done an additional interview with Daniel over at <a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/ASoWS/News/Entry/Interview_with_Daniel_Abraham/\" rel=\"nofollow\">at Westeros</a>.

A lot of people seem to buy the graphic novels, not realizing they're comic adaptations rather than the prose originals, so there's definitely an interest.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"February 11 2011, 19:48:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1297453713,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/106579300/32753956","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12047570#t12047570","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12047570#t12047570","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12047570#t12047570","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_353241","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ruylopezdefns","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12047570,"talkid":47060,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12047570#t12047570","above":12020434,"upictitle":"Roy Lopez: pic#106579300","article":"I'm a Dolphins fan too!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"February 15 2011, 17:35:32 UTC","parent":12020434,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ruylopezdefns","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ruylopezdefns","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_353241","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=32753956&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ruylopezdefns","ctime_ts":1297791332,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020690#t12020690","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020690#t12020690","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020690#t12020690","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"gsean","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gsean.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12020690,"talkid":46955,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/195538.html?thread=12020690#t12020690","upictitle":"gsean: pic#0","article":"They are works of art and I can't wait.
