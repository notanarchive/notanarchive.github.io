{"itemid":1663,"subject":"Draft Days","event":"It's draft weekend for the National Football League, so of course I have been glued to my television set.  This year, for the first time in decades, they are holding the draft in Chicago instead of NYC, and it looks as though the whole city has gone crazy.  Nothing can compare with the pulse-pounding excitement of a name being read out every ten minutes (five in later rounds).\r\n\r\nAnyway, looks to me as if the Jets and Giants are both doing very well this year.\r\n\r\nThe Jets probably better.  DT Leonard Williams, supposedly \"the best player in the draft,\" fell all the way to Gang Green at pick #6, which should give us the best D-line in the NFL.  And in the fourth round, the Jets finally found our Quarterback of the Future in Bryce Petty (who may well become the Quarterback of the Present if Geno Smith does not start playing better real soon).\r\n\r\nBut I liked the Giants' picks too.  They picked up a promising pass rusher whose name I will never be able to pronounce, and made an aggressive trade to go up and get one of the top safeties in the draft... a definite need, given how many big plays the secondary gave up last year.\r\n\r\nRound six is now in progress, and seven coming up.  With luck, both of my teams will find a few diamonds in the rough with those late picks.","ditemid":425886,"eventtime":"2015-05-02 14:26:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1431211935,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Draft Days http://goo.gl/Yx33Gq","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.68748784164196]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430598435}","revtime":1431830828},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-05-02 20:26:26","anum":158,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html","event_timestamp":1430576760,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123414693/71027746","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21575070#t21575070","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21575070#t21575070","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21575070#t21575070","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2604874","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/LaceUpBearDown","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21575070,"talkid":84277,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21575070#t21575070","upictitle":"Dan K: pic#123414693","article":"I think the Jets did the right thing by taking Leonard Williams at <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%236\">#6</a> even though they have good defensive linemen on the roster.

Not to mention you would've had to pay a (Night's) King's ransom just to move up 4 or 5 slots lol. Williams is a great player and it'll make what happens with Wilkerson (and \"Snacks\" Harrison, who's a good NT but might be gone when his contract's up) that much more interesting. Needless to say there was a huge sigh of relief when the Pats finally took Tre Jackson, but it's because you guys made some good picks. The AfC East is going to have some good defenses this year, and I think we'll actually have the toughest pass rushing division in the league. Triarch Belicho looked at his depleted cornerback levies after Revis's Rebellion, and said \"Ya know what man, f*** it\" and took 4 or 5 defensive lineman, finally getting the pass rush Pats fans everywhere have been whining about for years (I think they only finished 18th or 19th in sacks with last year's d-line). I think Petty COULD be the guy, but at the same time I think their best bet is having a qb competition, but if all things are equal let Petty ride the bench while Smith gives it another shot. Loved the Flowers pick even if others thought it was a little high, and I think Collins is good but it might take him a little bit to improve his coverage, Bobby Hart and Owa were good picks too. Also, I was a little disappointed Belichick (or anyone for that matter) didn't use a 7th rounder on La'el Collins. I have no idea what's going on with that murder investigation, but would've at least been worth a shot.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 3 2015, 04:48:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Pats fan here","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/tyler.b.mathews.7","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Tyler Bigdreamer Mathews","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3051597","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=74668398&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"May 3 2015, 04:50:33 UTC","dname":"Tyler Bigdreamer Mathews","ctime_ts":1430628480,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21579678#t21579678","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21579678#t21579678","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21579678#t21579678","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ae_hmd","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ae-hmd.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21579678,"talkid":84295,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425886.html?thread=21579678#t21579678","upictitle":"ae_hmd: pic#0","article":"You know you're in the optimistic part of the NFL year when a quarterback who dropped to the fourth round in a weak year for QBs is a cause for optimism.

It is an embarrassment to keep the Seahawks app on my phone. Pete Carroll and John Schneider have scraped the bottom of the draft barrel in their latest go-round. Their draft pick includes Frank Clark who, according to many news reports, has a history of domestic violence, home invasion, theft, driving violations and missed court dates. The precise charges are two cases of domestic violence including the second that involved striking his girlfriend in a hotel room, leaving welts and bloody marks, (he pleaded to a guilty charge of disorderly conduct). He was also arrested and convicted of second-degree felony home invasion after stealing a laptop from a dorm room. Other charges against him were being pulled over for driving on the wrong side of the center line without proof of insurance or proper plates and having a bench warrant issued against him after he missed his court date. If you are thinking, “This is going to end badly,” I’ll affirm that sentiment with the phrase “train wreck.” It’s the sports horror movie fans have seen too often where they cover their eyes and peek out between their fingers in morbid fascination at how coaches and team owners can’t or won’t understand the principle of Just Don’t Go There when the draft pick is a criminal and financial ticking time bomb for himself, the coaches, the owners and the team.
