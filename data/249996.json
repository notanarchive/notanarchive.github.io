{"itemid":976,"subject":"Wild Cards eBooks","event":"Tor has just announced a special holiday sale on the electronic editions of four Wild Cards ebooks.  From now until December 14, ebooks of the three Committee books and the reissue of WILD CARDS volume one (with! extra! added! content!) will be only $2.99.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000kcdsw/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000kcdsw/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nDetails can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/wild-cards-ebooks-now-299\r\n\r\nIf you're an ebook reader who has yet to sample the Wild Cards series, here's your chance to get a taste.  I'd recommend that you start with either WILD CARDS (where it all began) or with INSIDE STRAIGHT (first of the \"next generation\" books, and a great intro to the world).  But hell, at that price, you can buy all four for less than the price of a pizza.","ditemid":249996,"eventtime":"2011-11-16 18:39:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"e-books, tor, wild cards","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1322888818,"give_features":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-11-17 01:40:29","anum":140,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html","event_timestamp":1321468740,"reply_count":24,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?replyto=14941324","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941324#t14941324","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941324#t14941324","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941324#t14941324","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"horsthorst","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://horsthorst.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14941324,"talkid":58364,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941324#t14941324","upictitle":"Horst: pic#0","article":"Hm, the Amazon Kindle price for Wild Cards 1 is still $12.08. :(","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"November 17 2011, 08:25:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Amazon price","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://horsthorst.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"horsthorst","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"horsthorst","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://horsthorst.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"horsthorst","ctime_ts":1321518357,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67196599/1894931","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?replyto=14941836","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941836#t14941836","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941836#t14941836","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941836#t14941836","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"silks_ic","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://silks-ic.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14941836,"talkid":58366,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14941836#t14941836","upictitle":"Dug: Walks Cloak","article":"I don't get my Kindle until after Christmas (when the 'holidays' start in the UK) :(","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"November 17 2011, 10:06:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://silks-ic.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"silks_ic","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"silks_ic","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://silks-ic.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"silks_ic","ctime_ts":1321524370,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110356498/37877896","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?replyto=14942092","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14942092#t14942092","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14942092#t14942092","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14942092#t14942092","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_546792","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1025802506","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14942092,"talkid":58367,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14942092#t14942092","upictitle":"Jonathan Leard: pic#110356498","article":"I've definitely been interested since reading the short from Dreamsongs.

Even e-books cost money to create, and there are multiple costs to publishing in any format that aren't often considered by a retail customer.<br /><br />There have been multiple discussions over the last several years about these issues. I suggest if you want to read more about the reasons e-books, hell, any format that is currently used by publishers great and small cost what they cost, you look at some blogs and sites by professional writers, publishers, and professional organizations. Look at the SFWA site, and the blogs by many pros like Jay Lake, John Scalzi, Seannan McGuire for some serious discussions about how these issues affect writers and publishers. Check the archives of magazines and newpapers' business sections to see some of the factors involved, and what various players have done to stake out their own territory and power in this new format.<br /><br />The middlemen, like Amazon and Apple take a pretty good chunk of the retail cost of publishing e-books. There are some publishers and 'bookstores' that are publishing e-books at lower costs, especially with new and emerging writers. Look for companies like WizardsTowerBooks, and Small Beer Press, Weightless Books, you might find some good reading to your liking at lower costs.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"November 18 2011, 00:45:11 UTC","parent":14943372,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Love that these are on sale","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1321577111,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?replyto=14943884","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14943884#t14943884","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14943884#t14943884","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14943884#t14943884","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"westeros_fan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14943884,"talkid":58374,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/249996.html?thread=14943884#t14943884","upictitle":"westeros_fan: pic#0","article":"I just checked amazon.com and the kindle edition of Wildcards I is listed at $12.08.
