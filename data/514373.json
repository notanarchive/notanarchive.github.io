{"itemid":2009,"subject":"End of the Season","event":"The NFL wrapped up its regular season over the weekend, with victories for both of my teams.\r\n\r\nThe Jets defeated the Buffalo Bills 30-10.  Last year, when facing the Bills on the final weekend, Gang Green could have clinched a playoff spot with a win... so, of course, they choked and played the worst game of the reason.  This year, when the game meant absolutely nothing, they romped.  The Bills fired Rex Ryan after last week's loss, so you couldn't even pitch the contest as \"Hot Seat Bowl,\" with Buffalo playing under an interim coach.  \r\n\r\nThe highlight of the game came after the Jets kicked a field goal and kicked off to Buffalo.  The ball bounced into the endzone, while a Bills player stood over it looking at it curiously, as if to say, \"What is that?  Is that the ball?  Was I supposed to catch it?  I forget.  Maybe I should pick it up?\"  While he was pondering, one of the Jets rushed past him and fell on the ball for a touchdown.  Maybe it was good Rex was not on the sideline, his head might have exploded.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I think Buffalo made a mistake in letting go of Rex.  They did not even give him two years, and they are not likely to find anyone better.  The Bills are a deeply dysfunctional franchise; they keep hiring new coaches, but never give them time to build a winner.   No wonder they have been out of the playoffs longer than any other team in the NFL.\r\n\r\nThe Jets are not much better, however.  The win left them with a record of 5-11 on the season, and the sixth overall draft slot.  But they still have no quarterback.  Christian Hackenberg, their second round draft pick last year, finally dressed for a game, but still did not play.  Ryan Fitzpatrick started and finished and played... well, okay, but everyone seems certain that he will not be back next year.  Neither will Geno.  Which leaves Gang Green with the broken Bryce Petty and the totally untested Hackenberg and that draft pick.   Do they use that on yet another young qb?  So they try to address one of their many other needs?  Do they pick up a quarterback in free agency or trade for one?  If so, who?  I hear talk of Romo, Cutler, and Kaepernick, which seems to me just a choice of poison.  Arsenic, cyanide, or strychnine, what would you like?  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Jets did keep their head coach... but fired a whole bunch of assistant coaches.  So I don't know if they really have much more continuity than the Bills, when you get down to it.  Sigh.  Sometimes it's hard to be green...\r\n\r\nSo let's go blue, and talk about the Giants.  They won too, and much more impressively, defeating the Potomac Drainage Basin Indigenous People 19-10.  (Would have been 13-10, except for a freak defensive touchdown on Washington's last desperation play).  The game was not really as close as the score, since Big Blue's defense dominated throughout, pretty well shutting down one of the league's highest scoring offenses.   What made the win even more impressive was that the Giants were already locked into the #5 seed in the playoffs, win or lose, and had nothing to play for, while the Redskins had everything to play for.  I was glad to see that Ben McAdoo and Eli Manning played to win regardless; I hate it when teams lie down on the last day of the season.  (I am looking at you, Cowboys).\r\n\r\nThe Giants ended up with an 11-5 record on the season, and their first playoff appearance since they won the SuperBowl in 2011.  Can they do it again?  Odds are against them, but you never know.  The G-Men do have a great defense, and it is often said that defense wins championships.  We'll see.  The road starts at Green Bay.  That should be a great game.  In Aaron Rodgers, the Packers have the best QB in the game, but their potent offense will be facing the Giants' tough defense.  On the other side of the ball, however, a weak Green Bay defense with a porous secondary and no pass rush will be matched against a New York offense that has no running game, an offensive line that gives Eli no protection, and only one downfield threat in Odell Beckham.  So it will be strength against strength, and weakness against weakness.  \r\n\r\nThe Packers are favored, and rightly so.  Mr. Discount Doublecheck is red hot.  On the other hand, in the past Eli Manning has played his best ball in the playoffs, the O-line has gotten a little better since Justin Pugh returned, and even the running game showed some signs of life, at least when Perkins has the ball in place of Jennings.  We shall see.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 1.8em\"><b>Go G-MEN!</b></span>","ditemid":514373,"eventtime":"2017-01-03 16:54:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Jan  3 23:54:23 2017]R [Tue Jan  3 23:54:24 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/816432554437967873 ","current_moodid":43,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1483832870,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/816432554437967873","reading_time":6,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.715616060581067]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1483487675}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2009?v=1483837208","revtime":1483832828},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-03 23:54:23","anum":69,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html","event_timestamp":1483462440,"reply_count":62,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25484869#t25484869","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25484869#t25484869","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25484869#t25484869","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25484869#t25484869","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3957931","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/103923042998206097090","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25484869,"talkid":99550,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25484869#t25484869","upictitle":"Frederik Van Praet: pic#0","article":"If you could pick one ASOIAF character to play for the Jets, who would it be and why would it be Tormund?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 4 2017, 00:00:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/103923042998206097090","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Frederik Van Praet","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3957931","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=80267639&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Frederik Van Praet","ctime_ts":1483488051,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25486149#t25486149","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25486149#t25486149","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25486149#t25486149","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25486149#t25486149","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25486149,"talkid":99555,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/514373.html?thread=25486149#t25486149","above":25484869,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I'm not sure if that's due to Green Bay finding hidden talent that can generate productive runs on their own or Rodgers just being so dang good he opens up those lanes (probably a combination of both).<br /><br />If I had to predict gameflow, I think Rodgers gets bottled up on the first few drives but then the Packers start to get creative with running the ball and quick passes to the backs which will open things up and put the G-Men back on their heels for quite some time. Rodgers was scary enough on his own but now he has some form of help. If the Giants are going to win, Eli is going to have to get ahead on the first few possessions and not look back.

Of the teams not called the Dallas Cowboys or New England Patriots (go Pats!) the Steelers and the Packers are the most dangerous going into the playoffs. The Giants have a great D this season, ranking 10th overall and are 2nd in points allowed at 17.8 (my Pats are first with 15.6). But Rodgers, along with Ryan and Brady, is among the best right now. I don't think the Giants will be able to hold Green Bay to only 17 points (they torched the Seahawks number 5 defense like it was nothing), so the Giants offense will have to show up if they want any chance at winning. Keep in mind the Giants offense only averages 19 points per game, and are only 25th overall. And while there is that saying \"defense wins championships\" you still need offense. Maybe Eli will show up and be the playoff QB that crushed my dreams as a teenager in 2007 and 2011. They can't have him be the turnover machine he's been this season, not against the Packers. <br /><br />Also, why don't you like teams resting their players?
