It just doesn't make sense to go from great one year to bad butterfingers the next. I don't think you can put all the blame on the player. Have to wonder if it's partially QB and coaching. Edwards was a first round pick and is young, I think you'll find he was worth it. It's a good trade for him too though, I don't know how Derek Anderson managed to go from rising star to 2/17, but he did, and Quinn hasn't been much better.<br /><br />I like Ricky Williams quite a bit actually. If it wasn't for a retarded backwards policy on pot, he might of been a hall of fame candidate.<br /><br />If it's any consolation I have a good chance of being sad next week if the Vikings lose to Baltimore.

After watching the Jets Dolphins game (not an impartial observer - go Dolphins!), I was a little disappointed in Sanchez. His range wasn't that good, he went deep and he went short, very little mid range passing. And against a team that has corners and safeties that can stop a deep pass he wouldn't do as well. I also heard the commentators mention that he tends to give 'looks' to his intended receivers, making him easier to read.<br /><br />Without that dreadful 49yd pass interference call, the two ridiculous personal fouls penalties, and the 2 punt fakes (who does it twice!?), then the Jets offence really weren't in it. <br /><br />Yes, Braylon Edwards looked good. No doubt, he's got hands, speed and ability. <br /><br />Now, Chad Henne, he is looking good, has it all, and is improving. If I had to pick a rookie QB this year, its not Sanchez.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"October 13 2009, 16:06:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Really, Sanchez?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://keenemarin.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"keenemarin","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"keenemarin","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://keenemarin.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"keenemarin","ctime_ts":1255450001,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109915172/10560429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114540.html?replyto=7757676","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114540.html?thread=7757676#t7757676","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114540.html?thread=7757676#t7757676","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114540.html?thread=7757676#t7757676","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nycfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7757676,"talkid":30303,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114540.html?thread=7757676#t7757676","above":7753580,"upictitle":"nycfalcon: pic#109915172","article":"I'd have to agree with you.
