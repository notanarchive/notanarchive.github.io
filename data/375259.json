Speaking of game of thrones, does anybody have any good ways to recap on the events of a feast for crows and a dance with dragons? I really don't want to forget anything that happened before the next books.

I must confess that as much as I enjoy the show I've been really unhappy with their treatment of the Wall this season. <br /><br />I began as a humble show watcher but after season 3 I read what we yet have of the series and fell even more deeply in love with the world of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones. I was looking forward to a long action packed season, expecting the initial South of the Wall Wildling assault roundabouts episode 4... with a break and mourning episode followed by the first attack on the North side of the Wall, which I expected to go on for about 2 episodes. Even if it was just coming back to the Wall to see Night's Watchment shooting arrows off the Wall and talking about how the Wildling's weren't letting up... seeing the growing exhaustion. Followed by perhaps another lull episode as we got a break in the combat of the siege to chat a bit, followed by the final portion of the battle of the Wall at episode 9 or 10. I understand the limitations of budget, and figured they would trim things down with tricks like just talking about the battles or just showing archers on the Wall while he mostly hear rather than truly see the Wildling army, or perhaps see them CGI from the height of the Wall... but yeah... I've been rather disappointed they're condensing so much into a single episode Blackwater style. I understood Blackwater as a single episode... but the length of time expended and the resulting exhaustion is just such a big part of the Battle of the Wall. That the top of the Wall is effectively out of range for the Wildings and that the Night's Watch are simply running out of arrows and bolts and stones is such a big part of the battle and I'm kind of sad that that will be difficult to properly convey.<br /><br />Again, I've watched all the commentaries on all of the DVDs and I get the needs of budgeting but the show is just so successful any money spent would be more than made back and I didn't see any other way to do it... and all of the filler at the Wall and the drawing out of the attack just seems so forced... and annoying considering we should have been getting episodes of combat. I totally get the changes to Bran's storyline for depiction in the show medium, but tying it to Jon's as they did, did nothing for me.<br /><br />But, if you are excited then I am excited once again! However... please tell us that you'll make another post AFTER the episode to let us know your thoughts on it, changes, consistencies, performances, depictions (ideally good and bad)! That would be wonderful.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"June 8 2014, 05:04:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Was concerned... but if you&#39;re excited I&#39;m excited","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gehrig.jon","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gehrig JonLou","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2565121","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70603342&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"June 8 2014, 05:06:32 UTC","dname":"Gehrig JonLou","ctime_ts":1402203876,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19246811#t19246811","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19246811#t19246811","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19246811#t19246811","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2518566","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/100266029249740897315","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19246811,"talkid":75182,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19246811#t19246811","upictitle":"Zain Tejani: pic#0","article":"Excited for tomorrow night, though I don't know how it can top The Mountain and the Viper!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"June 8 2014, 07:20:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Valar Morghulis","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/100266029249740897315","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Zain Tejani","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2518566","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69884652&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Zain Tejani","ctime_ts":1402212007,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122713328/31972280","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19247067#t19247067","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19247067#t19247067","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19247067#t19247067","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"urbanflowerpot","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://urbanflowerpot.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19247067,"talkid":75183,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/375259.html?thread=19247067#t19247067","upictitle":"urbanflowerpot: blog shot","article":"Ohh the anticipation is sweet!
