MAISIE WILLIAMS will be joining us in person right here in Santa Fe.&nbsp; That&#39;s Monday, January 20.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark it down on your calendars.","ditemid":351828,"eventtime":"2014-01-06 11:39:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1389158329,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1389492648},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-01-06 18:39:53","anum":84,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/351828.html","event_timestamp":1389008340,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115254179/45271525","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/351828.html?thread=18574932#t18574932","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/351828.html?thread=18574932#t18574932","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/351828.html?thread=18574932#t18574932","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_965814","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=503967423","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18574932,"talkid":72558,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/351828.html?thread=18574932#t18574932","upictitle":"Greg Miller: pic#115254179","article":"This sounds so awesome I wish Ilived closer.
