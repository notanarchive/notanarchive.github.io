{"itemid":547,"subject":"Creeping Crud","event":"Been fighting the crud for the past week.  Nothing major, just annoying.  Started as a slight sore throat which crept down into my chest and now has me hacking up phlegm.  The sore throat is gone now and I keep expecting the rest to be gone any day now, but the damn thing is lingering.  Pisses me off.  It is slowing me down at the time when I desperately need not to be slowed down.  I'm running at maybe 75%, my sleep cycle is screwed to hell, and I am tiring much too easily.\r\n\r\nWell, never mind.  *cough cough*  \r\n\r\nAside from that, life is good.\r\n\r\nThe Jets seem to have acquired LaDamian Tomlinson.  Good for them, I guess.  I still refuse to call him LT.  There's only one LT and his name is Lawrence Taylor.  Tomlinson can be LD.  I hope he can still run.  Replacing Thomas Jones won't be easy.","ditemid":140158,"eventtime":"2010-03-15 13:01:00","props":{"taglist":"everyday life, nfl","current_moodid":82,"commentalter":1268860844,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":154,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"45:4,10:32,57:8,23:4,3:4,24:8,25:20,4:4,39:8,26:12,9:16,13:12","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1269381490},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-03-15 19:01:31","anum":126,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html","event_timestamp":1268658060,"reply_count":51,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/7145910/1170888","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9193342#t9193342","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9193342#t9193342","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9193342#t9193342","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"megmca","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://megmca.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9193342,"talkid":35911,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9193342#t9193342","article":"Sleep.<br /><br />I once had a cold that lasted two weeks.

The adaptive immune response is the one involving antibodies and specific recognition and responses to specific agents (viruses, allergens) that we have encountered before. It is also the system that can go haywire by causing damage to innocent tissues of our own body in those who have rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease or just allergic rhinitis.<br /><br />The innate immune response is the sum of cellular and structural defenses that are our first line of defense, and what we rely on to defend us from infection by novel agents that we have not encountered before.<br /><br />Vitamin D, acting through the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), stimulates cells used in the innate response to produce AMPs or anti-microbial peptides. These AMPs are basically endogenously produced antibiotics with names like defensin 2, defensin 3, and cathelicidin . The cells stimulated include the white blood cells known as monocytes, neutrophils and natural killer cells and the epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract (nose, tracheobronchial tree and lungs).<br /><br />Say a dose of virus particles is inhaled as an aerosol into your bronchus. The particles must first penetrate the physical barrier of mucus lining the respiratory epithelium. Once past that barrier, there is an aqueous film containing AMPs that can immediately attack the virus. In addition, contact with cells by molecules from the invading organism like PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns) stimulate production and release of more AMPs. The AMPs, in an action reminiscent of the lectins plants use as self-defense against animals like us, bind to and damage the lipoprotein cell membrane of bacteria or the viral envelope of the virus. Any damage to epithelial cells induces release of yet more AMP to fend off the invader, and more immune cells are called in to the scene. The net effect of more AMP production is lower penetration by and poorer survival and replication of virus particles.<br /><br />Vitamin D enables the machinery to produce more AMPs to act as the primary line of defense. In this way, transmission of the virus to the uninfected is discouraged, and those infected who have higher D levels will have a lower viral load to infect others.\"<br /><br />i'll post the rest in another comment<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 15 2010, 20:42:12 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thaneverbefore.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thaneverbefore","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thaneverbefore","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thaneverbefore.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thaneverbefore","ctime_ts":1268685732,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9197694#t9197694","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9197694#t9197694","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9197694#t9197694","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9197694#t9197694","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thaneverbefore","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thaneverbefore.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9197694,"talkid":35928,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/140158.html?thread=9197694#t9197694","upictitle":",: pic#0","article":"Vitamin D affects the Immune system in ways that mitigate the damage if you are infected.<br /><br />The lower ability of the virus to replicate in those with higher D levels and better innate immunity will diminish the severity of the illness in those affected.<br /><br />In addition, there are VDRs on macrophages that respond to higher D levels. This is where the adaptive immune response comes in. Certain arms of the adaptive response (including the macrophage response) are actually attenuated by having higher D levels.<br /><br />Macrophages elaborate proinflammatory cytokines like Interferon g, TNFa and IL-2 in a “destroy the village in order to save it” fashion in an attempt to kill the virus. There can consequently be a lot of local tissue damage that in fact accounts for much of the phenotype (nastiness) of the virus in the infected. Such a cytokine storm as part of the adaptive response is characteristic of avian (bird) flu, where patients “drown in mucus” due to the overwhelming nature of the response and often require ventilator support to avoid death. The cytokine storm is thought to be a key feature of the virulence of the virus in the 1918 pandemic.<br /><br />So higher D levels make you less likely to get infected.<br /><br />With higher D levels, if you do get infected, you are much less likely to get severely ill, and more likely to be able to breathe on your own.<br /><br />With higher D levels, if you do get infected, you are probably also less likely to spread the virus to others.<br /><br />How high a level do you need?<br /><br />From Cannell, Vieth, et al. :<br /><br /><br /><br />Prevent rickets 10 ng/ml<br /><br />Suppress parathyroid hormone 20 ng/ml<br /><br />Maximize intestinal calcium absorption 34 ng/ml<br /><br />Maximize muscle strength 50 ng/ml<br /><br /><br /><br />We don’t know the minimal number to protect against influenza, but the above levels of benefit are well established.<br /><br />I continue to recommend, at minimum, supplementation to above 50 ng/ml and preferably above 60 ng/ml.
