{"itemid":2091,"subject":"Wild Cards IV: Aces Abroad Kindle Edition","event":"Wild Cards IV: Aces Abroad Kindle Edition on Amazon.com for $2.99!\r\n\r\n\r\nNow in development for TV: Rights to develop Wild Cards for TV have been acquired by Universal Cable Productions, the team that brought you The Magicians and Mr. Robot, with the co-editor ofWild Cards, Melinda Snodgrass as executive producer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action-packed alternate fantasy returns for a new generation, featuring fiction from #1 New York Times bestselling author George R. R. Martin, Michael Cassutt, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Lewis Shiner, and more&mdash;plus two completely new stories from Kevin Andrew Murphy and bestselling author Carrie Vaughn.\r\n\r\nForty years after the Wild Card Virus&#39;s release, the World Health Organization decides it&#39;s time to take a delegation of Aces, Jokers, politicians, and journalists on a fact-finding mission to learn how other countries are dealing with the virus that reshaped humanity. Leading the team is Gregg Hartmann, a senator with presidential aspirations and a dangerous ace up his sleeve. Joining him is a menagerie of some of the series&#39; best and most popular Wild Cards, including Dr. Tachyon, aces Peregrine and Golden Boy, and jokers Chrysalis, Troll, and Father Squid.\r\n\r\nFrom the jungles of Haiti and Peru to the tumultuous political climate of Egypt, from a monastery in Japan to the streets of the most glamorous cities of Europe, the Wild Cards are in for an eye-opening trip. While some are worshiped as actual gods, those possessing the most extreme mutations are treated with a contempt that&#39;s all too familiar to the delegates from Jokertown. New alliances will be formed, new enemies will be made, and some actions will fulfill centuries-old prophecies that make ripples throughout the future of the Wild Cards universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Wild-Cards-IV-Aces-Abroad-ebook/dp/B00L73GTMW/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1493745890&amp;sr=8-1\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#fa0a0a;\">THIS MESSAGE HAS BE BROGHT TO YOU BY THE MINIONS OF FEVRE RIVER</span>\r\n\r\n#GRRMinion","ditemid":535495,"eventtime":"2017-05-03 08:21:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","taglist":"amazon.com, wild cards, #1, #grrminion, tor.com","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"version":1,"commentalter":1494645384,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"lenore","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":3,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.603652057435787]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1493828970}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2091?v=1494645420","revtime":1494645419},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-05-03 14:21:26","anum":199,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535495.html","event_timestamp":1493799660,"reply_count":4,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123371686/70873652","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535495.html?thread=26069447#t26069447","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535495.html?thread=26069447#t26069447","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535495.html?thread=26069447#t26069447","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2587046","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2246029","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26069447,"talkid":101833,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535495.html?thread=26069447#t26069447","upictitle":"Frank Probst: pic#123371686","article":"Just bought the book, but I wanted to ask if there was any reason why this particular book got the special pricing?
