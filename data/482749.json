Most of them forward packages and parcels as well as the mail.<br /><br />I am a book seller, located here in the USA, and I sell books online. I ship books to customers all over the world, but I do not ship them to every country. I only ship books to about 1/3 of the world's countries directly, for various different reasons. For those potential customers who live in a country that I am either unable to ship too, or am unwilling to ship too, this is a good alternative.  <br /><br />Their are hundreds of Mail Forwarding Services to choose from that are located here in the USA.  A simple search will bring up hundreds of them. They usualy charge a modest fee, usually no greater than 25% of the total cost of USPS International Postage.<br /><br />This would probably solve your dilema as you could order the signed books that you want from the Cocteau Theatre, and they would then ship it to the domestic address of the Mail Forwarding Service located here in the USA.  The forwarding service, after receiving the package, would then ship the package to your home address, wherever it is that you live in the world. Just make sure to purchase the appropriate amount of postal insurance along with the international postage from the Mail Forwarding Service The Cocteau Theatre will have fufilled its obligation to you, once USPS Tracking shows that the package was delivered to the Mail Forwarding Sercice of your choosing. Everthing that happens with the package after that is between you and the Mail Forwarding Service that you choose to use.<br /><br />I buy books from Europe and Great Britain all the time,  and , many of those book sellers choose not to ship any further than their neiboring countries, and do not offer shipping service to the USA.  It  works well and usually adds no more than a week or so to the package's transit time.<br /> <br />It might be worth your while. <br /><br />Thank you George for going through all of the hard work, time, and money that it takes to own and run a buisnees like the Jean Cocteau Theatre, and for offering an online store that we can purchase signed copies of some of our favorite author's books, many who may or may not make it to the city that we live in, anytime in the near future.<br /><br />It is much appreciated.
