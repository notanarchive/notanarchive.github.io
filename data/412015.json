{"itemid":1609,"subject":"How Many Seasons?","event":"Here we go again.\r\n\r\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY is doing a big double-issue about GAME OF THRONES. Four gorgeous variant covers (collect them all, kids!), and pages and pages of material... including a sidebar feature about how long the series will run.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/11/game-thrones-end\r\n\r\nThis discussion is nothing new, of course. I get asked similar questions every time I make a public appearance, do an interview, or walk a red carpet. My usual answer is a variant on, &quot;I don&#39;t know how many seasons the show will run.&quot;\r\n\r\nI <i><b>don&#39;t</b></i> know. No one knows.\r\n\r\nThis is Hollywood, friends. As William Goldman wrote in ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE, in Hollywood &quot;nobody knows anything.&quot;\r\n\r\nI do know that David &amp; Dan have stated in interviews that they see the show winding up in seven seasons. People send me emails about that every time I say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; in response to the question, as if I were somehow unaware of what D&amp;D have said. I&#39;m not.\r\n\r\nI also know that HBO wants the series to run longer than that. I have known that since the very beginning... well, actually, since the day after the second episode of season one aired, when I had lunch with one of HBO&#39;s top execs, who told me, &quot;We want this to run ten years.&quot; I allowed that ten years sounded fine to me. I continue to hear similar sentiments from HBO every time I have meeting with them, be it in LA or New York.\r\n\r\nAnd it should be pointed out that neither ten seasons or even seven is locked in. Right now, GAME OF THRONES is guaranteed only <i><b>six </b></i>seasons. That&#39;s all HBO has officially committed to, by contract. We can speculate about additional seasons beyond that, but that&#39;s all it is, speculation. A lot of things can happen between now and season seven, or eight, or nine, things that cannot be anticipated. Believe me, I&#39;ve been there. I was on staff on an hour-long TV series that was pulled off the air and retooled as a half-hour show. I was on staff on another show that could easily have run five, six seasons... until our lead actress left, and took most of our audience with her. I had a pilot that was so hot that the network ordered six back-up scripts and all but guaranteed us a midseason slot... but without an actual production order, that meant nothing when the network underwent some big personnel changes, and new people came in.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that any of these things will happen with GAME OF THRONES. But they could. Weird stuff happens in television, and there are sooooo many factors involved. Budgets. Actors&#39; contracts. New shows in development. Ratings (though HBO does not weigh ratings as heavily as the broadcast networks, that does not mean they are unaware of them). Awards.\r\n\r\nHBO usually renews their shows for one season at a time. It was very unusual, last year, when they stepped up soon after the season four debut to order <i><b>both</b></i> season five and season six. Bloggers and journalists can speculate as they please, but none of it will mean anything until next year, when season six begins to air. Around the time that the second episode of season six is showing, HBO will order season seven, we hope... or maybe, just maybe, they will order seasons seven AND eight. But even if they just order season seven, that doesn&#39;t mean that the show will end in seven; it could just represent a return to the original policy of committing to only one season at a time.\r\n\r\nAll of which is a long-winded way of saying what I said to begin with: no one knows.\r\n\r\nI see that this new crop of stories also raises, once again, the notion of concluding the series with one or more feature films. And in some of these stories, once again, this idea is wrongly attributed to me. Let me state, yet again, that while I love this idea, it did NOT originate with me. It was a notion suggested to me, which I have enthusiastically endorsed... but since I was the first person to raise the possibility in public, somehow I am being seen as its father.\r\n\r\nSure, I love the idea. Why not? What fantasist would not love the idea of going out with an epic hundred million feature film? And the recent success of the IMAX experience shows that the audience is there for such a movie. If we build it, they will come. But will we build it? I have no bloody idea.\r\n\r\nAs we go forward, I expect I will have a voice in all these decisions. But mine will only be one voice among many, and there are all sorts of other factors that can come into play. I will say, I am incredibly fortunate in having partners like HBO, and David Benioff and Dan Weiss. Seven seasons, ten seasons, with or without one or two feature films... in the end, all that matters is that we tell a great story, with a great end.","ditemid":412015,"eventtime":"2015-03-12 01:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1427399268,"crosspost_tw":" How Many Seasons? http://j.mp/1NQSvEk","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","hasscreened":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.617537845147392]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1427040208}","revtime":1427040961},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-13 02:04:46","anum":111,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html","event_timestamp":1426122660,"reply_count":140,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123618612/71412910","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20372335#t20372335","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20372335#t20372335","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20372335#t20372335","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2647816","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/jordan.ray2","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20372335,"talkid":79579,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20372335#t20372335","upictitle":"Jordan Ray: pic#123618612","article":"Different subject.

But of course I know by your words alone that you made that decision to work on KONG.  <br /><br />However if you write at least a script for the final season it can be seen as a seal of approval in a way and that you're still trying to make the best possible story with D&D even if the 'show is the show and the books are the books'.

I really enjoy the show, and I don't necessarily have qualms about them changing or streaming material to suit a 10-episode visual format, but I have no interest in learning the outcomes of the Battle of Winterfell, the Battle of Meereen, or Cersei's trial via proxy.<br /><br />Bran's absence next season is actually a bit of a comfort for me, because it means they're trying to keep his journey at a common velocity with the rest of the story. The real concern for me is Sansa, who only has one published chapter left to adapt, and it's her scenes that will have my index finger hovering over the mute button.<br /><br />I know that might sound a bit precious, but the show is genuinely starting to alter my perception of certain aspects of the story, and I'd really like to experience the final act as it was intended, rather than HBO's cliff-notes. Resolving little mysteries and giving tidbits of lore outside the book's scope is one thing (e.g., the White Walker youth outreach program), but I managed to spoil myself on a couple of major events in the first three books (such as the Red Wedding), and while I don't think it robbed those events of any narrative substance (and, indeed, they have grown richer upon rereads), their emotional impact was reduced, and I didn't quite feel the raw vulnerability and surprise that I think George intended me to feel.

Mind boggling. <br /><br /><br />I am wondering something however, about the show adaption by HBO. Do you prefer the show staying true to the work its based upon, or do you feel that an adaption to a new medium should experiment with the base structure of the story or try something different? Would you prefer seeing alternate stories explored or different outcomes to events both past and future in the novels? I've heard multiple takes on this from a few published authors i've interviewed, who've had adaptions based on their works, and it seems their all very split on the philosophy behind what makes a good adaption of a work. <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"March 13 2015, 12:02:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The Future Seasons","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/byron.gillan","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Byron Gillan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3046503","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=74624690&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Byron Gillan","ctime_ts":1426248158,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20398191#t20398191","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20398191#t20398191","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20398191#t20398191","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20398191#t20398191","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20398191,"talkid":79680,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20398191#t20398191","above":20389743,"upictitle":"George R.R.

But going beyond that is always a risk.  The best Marvel movies, for instance, are those that stay closest to Stan Lee.<br /><br />There is a reason a book or a comic is closer for adaptation, after all.  Hollywood does not buy bad novels or comic books; they are cherry-picking the good stuff.<br /><br />That being said, no adaptation can be completely faithful.
