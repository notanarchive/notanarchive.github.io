{"itemid":472,"subject":"Make It a WILD CARDS Christmas","event":"Pat of Pat's Fantasy Hotlist runs good contests, evil Dallas Cowboys fan that he is.  Right now he's giving away five sets of the first two books in our current Wild Cards triad, INSIDE STRAIGHT and BUSTED FLUSH.  \r\n\r\nCheck out the details at http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2009/11/win-set-of-wild-cards-novels.html\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tor has scheduled the release of SUICIDE KINGS, the third and concluding volume of the Committee triad, for December 22.  \r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0005sxd5/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0005sxd5/s320x240\" width=\"157\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe contributing writers for this one are Ian Tregillis, Caroline Spector, Melinda Snodgrass, Victor Milan, S.L. Farrell, and Daniel Abraham. \r\n \r\nRustbelt, the Amazing Bubbles, Double Helix, the Radical, Gardener, and Jonathan (Bugsy) Hive provide the threads for our tapestry in this tale of love, war, revenge, and madness in the heart of darkness... but other Wild Cards favorites will also appear, including Cameo, Hoodoo Mama, Lohengrin, Dr. Finn, Popinjay, and many more. Not to mention the usual host of new characters, in parts both large and small. \r\n\r\nSo draw an ace for Xmas, and give Wild Cards a try.  You won't be sorry.","ditemid":121080,"eventtime":"2009-12-01 13:19:00","props":{"taglist":"wild cards, anthologies","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1260552448,"picture_keyword":"lohengrin","personifi_word_count":185,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"2:2,10:4,11:11,37:4,42:2,29:2,3:47,19:4,4:43,9:31,21:2,13:4,nterms:yes","interface":"flat"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-01 20:19:48","anum":248,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html","event_timestamp":1259673540,"reply_count":15,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/66437100/3109074","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?replyto=8073720","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8073720#t8073720","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8073720#t8073720","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8073720#t8073720","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jimbow8","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jimbow8.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8073720,"talkid":31537,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8073720#t8073720","upictitle":"jimbow8: Cowboys","article":"Having never read any of the Wild Card novels, are these written by committee?

See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, I think Wikipedia gives a pretty good description.<br /><br />In the past, some of the books were really anthologies with quite independent stories. Then they introduced a more connected narrative arc, which eventually evolved into full-on mosaic novels where several writers essentially worked on chunks of a single novel. This trilogy is more in the connected narrative arc but still somewhat separate stories area.<br /><br /><em>Wild Cards</em> must now be the longest-running and most successful non-media shared world setting, so I think they're doing something right. The best introduction to the setting is the original <em>Wild Cards</em> novel, but this latest trilogy follows a mostly whole new cast of characters and are specifically written to be an introduction for new readers. Give it a go, they're quite fun (especially if you enjoy superheroes).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 1 2009, 22:49:52 UTC","parent":8073720,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1259707792,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/89860538/3109074","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?replyto=8075256","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8075256#t8075256","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8075256#t8075256","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8075256#t8075256","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jimbow8","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jimbow8.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8075256,"talkid":31543,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8075256#t8075256","above":8074744,"upictitle":"jimbow8: EarthMoon","article":"Thanks for the info.

I read all the other books in less than one week, because I couldn't stop reading, it was like a drug.<br /><br />Thank you for all your work and for all the effort. \"Ice and fire\" series is a fantasy masterpiece and I will remain forever one of your most enthusiastic readers. <br /><br />All my best wishes.<br /><br />Mary.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 2 2009, 09:27:23 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://xyzmary2001.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"xyzmary2001","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"xyzmary2001","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://xyzmary2001.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"xyzmary2001","ctime_ts":1259746043,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/9021884/1523329","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?replyto=8078328","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8078328#t8078328","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8078328#t8078328","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8078328#t8078328","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"arkham1010","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://arkham1010.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8078328,"talkid":31555,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8078328#t8078328","upictitle":"Arkham: pic#9021884","article":"Is this the closest you are going to get to wild card this year? <br /><br />*ducks* ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 3 2009, 00:05:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://arkham1010.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"arkham1010","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"arkham1010","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://arkham1010.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"arkham1010","ctime_ts":1259798747,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237873/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?replyto=8087800","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8087800#t8087800","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8087800#t8087800","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8087800#t8087800","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8087800,"talkid":31592,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121080.html?thread=8087800#t8087800","upictitle":"George R.R.
