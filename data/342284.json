The general consensus is that none of the three QBs are really an option. I advocated for Ponder when he was drafted, but he just can't shake it as a starter. Cassel is a bit more polished, though people forget that he was absolutely awful last year on a very talented team (as you can see this year). Josh Freeman *is* intriguing, with his cannon arm and his prior success, but he's not going to save the season this year. Might as well start him and let him get his bearings with the team if they feel he's a long-term option.<br /><br />Aside from all that, most people feel like it's time for Leslie Frazier and most of his coaching staff to go anyway.
