Pretty small because we're re-starting up.  I asked via the blog if you could ask NYC-area folk such as Anne Groelle (editor) or Gardner Dozois (editor, Book of Swords/Sons of the Dragon, Philadelphia area) if they could come but didn't hear back.<br /><br />I was working up my \"resume\" in the local cons so that I'm now applying to run Westeros panels at New York Comic Con 2017.  Odds of getting in are slim (they didn't have programming the past 2 years) but I hope prior experience gives me a boost.<br /><br />I figured I might as well ask again, this time far in advance:  would you be willing to ask either Dozois or Groell if they'd be open to guesting at a panel I'd run on World of Ice and Fire/Fire and Blood/Sons of the Dragon?  Their appearance would give us a better chance of having ANY panel.<br /><br />The thought particularly struck me because \"Book of Swords\" is due for release in October, and NYCC is in October too, so it's timed well to help promote the release (the first published Westeros material we're getting in 3 years).
