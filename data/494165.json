{"itemid":1930,"subject":"Next Monday at the Jean Cocteau","event":"We have a very big Sunday coming up at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the end of the excitement.   There's a great event scheduled for Monday, July 25 as well, one week from today.\r\n\r\nThat's when Dutch author THOMAS OLDE HEUVELT will be be visiting us, to talk about his new horror novel, HEX.  Heuvelt was the winner of a Hugo last year for his novelette \"The World Turned Upside Down.\"  HEX is something very different, though... \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/373050/373050_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/373464/373464_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/373735/373735_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/374084/374084_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThomas does not get to this side of the pond very often, much less down here to the Land of Enchantment, so don't miss your chance to meet him, and get your book signed.  HEX is creepy and gripping and original, sure to be one of the top horror novels of 2016.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"751\"/>\r\n\r\nYou can reserve a seat and a copy of the book at the JCC website: http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/","ditemid":494165,"eventtime":"2016-07-17 13:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, signings, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jul 18 19:36:08 2016]R [Mon Jul 18 19:36:09 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/755124016352899076 ","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1469150267,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/755124016352899076","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.73170877442299]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1468870620}","revtime":1469574188},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-07-18 19:36:06","anum":85,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html","event_timestamp":1468762560,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120142958/51623257","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789333#t24789333","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789333#t24789333","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789333#t24789333","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sourbillytipton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sourbillytipton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24789333,"talkid":96833,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789333#t24789333","article":"black leather jacket over a white tank top while wearing a pendant necklace for your author photo on the book sleeve?","upictitle":"sourbillytipton: pic#120142958","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"9 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"July 19 2016, 00:16:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"George, how come you don&#39;t pose with a...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sourbillytipton.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sourbillytipton","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sourbillytipton","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sourbillytipton.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sourbillytipton","ctime_ts":1468887398,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126340786/78214856","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789589#t24789589","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789589#t24789589","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789589#t24789589","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3750074","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/274008086290423/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24789589,"talkid":96834,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24789589#t24789589","upictitle":"Damon McAllister: pic#126340786","article":"First off, I'd like to thank you for your efforts over the years, for dedicating your life to us grateful fans by creating such a breathtaking and revolutionary fantasy world in Westeros, a place where your readers can <i>live</i> among the smallfolk and the nobles, all the way from the freezing Lands of Always Winter to the desolate landscape of Dorne.

I'm pretty impressed with what Thomas has achieved... he's still only in his early thirties and is able to make a living as a fulltime professional writer. That must be hard to achieve by itself, but he's also writing in Dutch (small market) and writing fantasy and horror. \"Dutch fantasy and horror literature\" has to be Niche with a capital 'N': I'm a big fantasy fan and I'm Dutch but I could not name a single other Dutch writer in his genre. <br /><br />I believe I remember reading here on your (not a) blog you personally did not think his Hugo winning novelette was Hugo worthy, but I'm glad to read you liked Hex (but maybe you did like the novelette as well even though you didn't think it was Hugo worthy). I'm not even sure why I like the fact that you liked Hex :) * Thomas very likely never dreamed of becoming a pioneer of Dutch horror/fantasy literature, but he could very well be paving the way for other young aspiring (Dutch) authors with his work. It's nice to see non-English fantasy writers (Cixin Liu from China being another recent Hugo winner) get some piece of the spotlight. There are many fantasy writers out there but not enough talented ones who make it, IMNSHO.<br /><br />Btw, do translators get a Hugo trophy as well when 'their' book/novelette/... wins? They really should, I think. It would really scare me if I were a professional writer and I had to turn over MY work to someone else. The translator can really make or break your story and if you win a Hugo then the translator at the very least did not break it.<br /><br />Anyway, I wish you all a good time this Monday. Try to feed Thomas lots of pizza and other belly-growing stuff and see how uncomfortable he gets: judging by his social media pictures he does like to show off his fit, lean body. Please do your best to destroy it on behalf of us non-fit people.<br /><br /><br /><br />* It's probably because I like \"fellow Dutch author\" to get the seal of approval from \"very famous author\", which is a sobering thought because that makes me more of a nationalist than I thought and hoped I was...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 months ago","ctime":"July 19 2016, 17:45:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hup Holland hup.","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/rogier.kraf","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Rogier Kraf","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1414295","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=52686073&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Rogier Kraf","ctime_ts":1468950350,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/89921433/1529162","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24791125#t24791125","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24791125#t24791125","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24791125#t24791125","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aien_hime","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aien-hime.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24791125,"talkid":96840,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/494165.html?thread=24791125#t24791125","upictitle":"aien_hime: Default","article":"Oh!
