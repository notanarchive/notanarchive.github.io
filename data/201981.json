The Stark children look more like Catelyn(blue eyes/auburn hair) than Eddard, the Lannisters have green eyes and blonde hair, the Baratheons have black hair, et cetera. I don't think this is nitpicking or making a big deal about nothing, I mean Jon Arryn was able to figure out *cough* a certain secret by researching phenotypes... <br /><br />The characters' ages seem off too. Sean Bean is 50(and a lot less rangy than I imagined Eddard). Jaime's actor is 40, Catelyn's is 45.
