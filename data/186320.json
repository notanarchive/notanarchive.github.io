I wonder if my perception of him as one of the goofiest comedic actors will retroactively imbue his early \"serious\" work with an element of farce. Personally, I'll always regard \"The Naked Gun\" movies as the high point of the brand of farce that \"Airplane\" started (although the presence of OJ Simpson does make the films a little creepy). Those four films are pretty much bear the gold standard of a genre that's been saturated so much it's as dead as Mr. Nielsen.\n\nThe most wonderful thing about his gifts as an artist was probably the way, he played comedy completely straight. He could say a line like, \"Come in, Jimmy. Sit down. Let's have a talk.\" with total sincerity and somehow it would be funny, despite the total lack of any discernible joke. Somehow, his very presence in a movie carried  the mythic resonance of someone who has made you laugh over and over, again. Every time he'd open his mouth, part of you wanted to laugh. Even when he was slumming it in lame fair like \"Spy Hard\", he always made me giggle.\n\nI'm sad he's gone but I'm also glad that he lived such a long life. Just the same, I can't think of a single male actor from his generation that's still alive, working and could do comedy as well as he could. Sure, Betty White and Cloris Leachman are still around and doing terrific work. But the void Leslie leaves behind is one that can never be filled.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"December 2 2010, 01:37:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Memories...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ashley-falls.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ashley_falls","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ashley_falls","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ashley-falls.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ashley_falls","ctime_ts":1291253837,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/186320.html?thread=11420624#t11420624","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/186320.html?thread=11420624#t11420624","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/186320.html?thread=11420624#t11420624","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"davenielsen78","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://davenielsen78.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11420624,"talkid":44611,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/186320.html?thread=11420624#t11420624","upictitle":"davenielsen78: pic#0","article":"I only saw that movie after having seen all his comedies.

I hope he had a good life.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"December 4 2010, 18:16:27 UTC","parent":11424208,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Bobby Strydio","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1291486587,"tracked":0}]}
