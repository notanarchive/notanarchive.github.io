It was a hit and miss book for some of my peers but I just love the writing style placed in that book. It is completely different then your current works (which I also love). At first I was very impatient about the release with A Dance With Dragons, having only picked up the series 3 years ago, but I understand now just how stressful it must be. I am a VERY big fan of A Song of Ice and Fire. Whenever I am in between a series I always pick up A Game of Thrones and just reread the entire series. The same goes when I get stuck at a certain point in my writing. I just pick up one of your books, crack it open to a random page and start reading. Your work is completely inspiring. As redundant as it sounds I can't wait for your next book, but in a good way. I know it will be just a fantastic work of art. Keep of the phenomenal work GRRM!<br /><br />Andrew Rene","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"May 5 2010, 09:06:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Keep up the fantastic work!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://werdnaace.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"werdnaace","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"werdnaace","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://werdnaace.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"werdnaace","ctime_ts":1273050402,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/150865.html?replyto=10167633","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/150865.html?thread=10167633#t10167633","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/150865.html?thread=10167633#t10167633","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/150865.html?thread=10167633#t10167633","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kdiddlyroamer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kdiddlyroamer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10167633,"talkid":39717,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/150865.html?thread=10167633#t10167633","upictitle":"kdiddlyroamer: pic#0","article":"Just wanted to cheer you on as you near the finish line with Dances.
