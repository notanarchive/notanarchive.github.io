That book really had me thinking.. I kept going back to it in my thoughts for weeks. I think it is safe to assume an unhappy ending... the story of Worlorn was a fairly grim tale.<br /><br />If you like Dying of the Light I would suggest picking up Fevre Dream. Another great story by Mr Martin. Entirely different from Dying of the light to the same degree that Dying of the Light was different from ASOIAF. <br /><br />Though the writing style of Martin is fairly similar in all his works I still find it amazing to realize that they are the same author. The tone and flavor of his books are so entirely different from eachother.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"November 8 2010, 21:07:23 UTC","parent":11288365,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: to george","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://astro-tiger.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"astro_tiger","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"astro_tiger","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://astro-tiger.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"astro_tiger","ctime_ts":1289250443,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51970829/2668298","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/181805.html?thread=11288877#t11288877","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/181805.html?thread=11288877#t11288877","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/181805.html?thread=11288877#t11288877","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cera_sumat","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cera-sumat.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11288877,"talkid":44097,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/181805.html?thread=11288877#t11288877","upictitle":"Shane: pic#51970829","article":"I just wanted to take a moment to stop by and say that your constant traveling and work really impress me.
