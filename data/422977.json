{"itemid":1652,"subject":"Max Is Coming","event":"I'm VERY excited to announce that Mad Max is coming to the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\nRemakes are often problematic, but this one looks as though it could be something special.  And I say that as a fan of the original Mel Gibson trilogy.  The first MAD MAX was just okay, I will admit, but BEYOND THUNDERDOME was damned good, and I rank the middle film, THE ROAD WARRIOR, as the best post-holocaust film, and one of the best SF adventures, ever made.  \r\n\r\nThe reboot looks as though it is drawing more on THE ROAD WARRIOR than the other two.  But hey, take a look for yourself:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"564\"/>\r\n\r\n(Ignore that last frame about 3D.  The Cocteau does not have 3D.  See it in gorgeous 2D!!!)\r\n\r\nWe're going to try and make FURY ROAD's run at the Cocteau a real event.  We are making arrangements to bring in Max's V8 Interceptor to park in front of the theatre, and we hope to have the Gyro Captain, the Humungus (Ayatollah of Rocknrollah), and Max himself on hand.  (No, not the actual actors, sorry).  (Not sure whether the Gyro Captain actually appears in FURY ROAD, but he's my favorite characters from ROAD WARRIOR, so he'll be here anyway).\r\n\r\nFURY ROAD will open at the Cocteau on the night of Thursday, May 14.  Advance tickets are available for purchase right now at the Cocteau website.  And as a special bonus for all you Warriors of the Wasteland, anyone who purchases an advance ticket to FURY ROAD, any showing, before May 10 will also get a FREE SMALL POPCORN.  Real butter and special toppings, no charge.\r\n\r\n\"Remember lingerie?\"","ditemid":422977,"eventtime":"2015-04-22 18:33:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, films","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1429934925,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Max Is Coming http://goo.gl/aUQgoC","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.718525621802313]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1429662857}","revtime":1431545188},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-22 00:33:18","anum":65,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422977.html","event_timestamp":1429727580,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124857576/75346238","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422977.html?thread=21416257#t21416257","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422977.html?thread=21416257#t21416257","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422977.html?thread=21416257#t21416257","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3118091","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/135001231","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21416257,"talkid":83657,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422977.html?thread=21416257#t21416257","upictitle":"Justin Mallery: pic#124857576","article":"Couldn't agree more.

The stories - especially BEYOND THUNDERDOME - were framed in a semi-mythical narrative; treating Max Rockatansky more or less like a cipher. That lends itself well to recasting, methinks. So I'm quite optimistic - after all, George Miller himself has written&directed FURY ROAD.<br /><br />P.S.: Speaking of George Miller, I *seriously* have to recommend his *other*, often overlooked masterpiece: BABE: PIG IN THE CITY. <br />Yes, I'm serious, you can stop laughing.

Grrr....<br /><br />But the reason I was posting is to point out that the premise of Mad Max was a world in which the oil has run out. Very believable in 1983. But today? We have spent much of the time since developing and deploying other options.<br /><br />One of the reasons Mad Max was so important was precisely because it was obvious that oil is a finite resource that is being depleted at an unsustainable rate. Even today when the scientific consensus is that we will destroy the ecology of our planet before we actually burn the lot, Max Max is an important counter to the climate change deniers. Even if the claims of the deniers are true we still face a choice between working out a sustainable course now or waiting till we get to Max Max.<br /><br />What rather worries me is that despite the fact that we seem to have been able to learn at least some lessons from Mad Max, we don't seem to be able to learn the obvious lesson from all those killer robot stories. We now have remote control drones out killing people and those drones are increasingly being made autonomous. All we need to complete the extinction cycle is for the production facilities to be automated and placed below ground to prevent attack and then for two similarly equipped adversaries to start a war.<br /><br />Unfortunately the killer robots of SF are far too smart.
