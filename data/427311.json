{"itemid":1669,"subject":"Fury Road","event":"FURY ROAD is doing great business at the Cocteau... and, indeed, all over Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the country.  I saw it myself last night.  It has got to be one of the most relentless action movies ever made, if not THE most intense.  Pretty much non-stop from beginning to end.  \r\n\r\nI've often said that the climatic chase sequence at the end of THE ROAD WARRIOR was the best car chase scene ever put on film (it's what DAMNATION ALLEY should have been, as I once told Roger Zelazny -- who agreed).  Well, FURY ROAD is the ROAR WARRIOR chase sequence with the dial turned up... not just to 11, but to 47 or some such.\r\n\r\nTruth be told, I sometimes get bored during car chases.  Not this one.  It has a human context that gives it a power lacking in FAST & FURIOUS and TRANSFORMERS movies.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I liked this one.  A lot.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did miss, however.  THE ROAD WARRIOR (a great film) and BEYOND THUNDERDOME (a good film with flaws) both ended with wonderful, moving, elegiac voice overs.  The one from THUNDERDOME always brings a tear to my eye.  \r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"573\"/>\r\n\r\nFURY ROAD has no similar elegy at the end.  I missed that... the poetry of it, and the sense of triumph and tragedy that it left me with, a feeling that elevated the movie into myth.  \r\n\r\nEven so, it's a helluva movie.\r\n\r\nSee it at the Cocteau, if you can.  (We'll be showing it for two more weeks, at least).  But see it somewhere, regardless.","ditemid":427311,"eventtime":"2015-05-16 20:42:00","props":{"current_mood":"drained","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"movies","current_moodid":40,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1433279295,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Fury Road http://goo.gl/vIOKPM","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.706771548959255]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1431830924}","revtime":1433456071},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-05-17 02:42:16","anum":47,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427311.html","event_timestamp":1431808920,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117094227/2289645","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427311.html?thread=21651247#t21651247","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427311.html?thread=21651247#t21651247","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427311.html?thread=21651247#t21651247","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jere7my","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21651247,"talkid":84575,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427311.html?thread=21651247#t21651247","upictitle":"jere7my: Glasses","article":"I just got back from seeing it at the Somerville (another fine independent theater).

A band of misshapen odd balls trying to just find peace in their unhappy lives go on an epic  adventure to a magical place that's to provide what they seek. They're chased by an annoying, villainous entity who is petty enough to want to kill our hero for shoes...oops, i mean for a little bit of fuel and water, and some young women who are treated like property.

The car chases are way better than all the Fast and Furious car chases and so is the plot. It’s unbelievable that Furious 7 is currently earning over 1.4 billion dollars. Although I understand that an R rated movie like Mad Max will never gain as much money as a normal rated movie, but it still deserves just as much attention. The same can be said about the transformers movies. Michael Bay will never direct a movie as good as a Mad Max movie by George Miller. Yes, they both have a lot of explosions and some big budget CGI, but that is not the most important part of this Mad Max movie (Although the burning guitar was a sick part that fitted perfectly in the mayhem that rules in this Mad Max movie). I simply hope now that Mad Max gains a worldwide popularity so that we can see many more Mad Max movies with the outstanding Tom Hardy. Yet, It will be difficult for him to replace Mel Gibson as the amazing Road Warrior that is Max Rockatansky.
