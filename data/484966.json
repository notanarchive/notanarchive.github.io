{"itemid":1894,"subject":"Hugo Withdrawal","event":"I see that the fanzine BLACK GATE has withdrawn from the Hugo race, after being slated by the Rabid Puppies and nominated (perhaps) as a result of that.   \r\n\r\nYou can read their reasons here:\r\nhttps://www.blackgate.com/2016/05/01/black-gate-declines-hugo-nomination/\r\n\r\nThis is the second year that BLACK GATE has refused a nomination, so one certainly has to admire them for their consistency.  And no one can deny that this is a very difficult decision for those, like BLACK GATE, that were put on the ballot by the Rabids without their consent  (it is an easy decision for the Rabids themselves and their allies, of course, most of whom are squealing as happily as pigs in shit).  \r\n\r\nSince I'm on record as urging the \"hostages\" to stand their ground, I can't applaud this decision.  But I will not criticize it either.  They had a tough call and they made it, consistent with their own politics and principles.\r\n\r\nI will quibble, however, about one of their assertions: that even if BLACK GATE had elected to remain on the ballot, they had no chance of winning.  I am not going to go so far as to say they were the favorite... but I think they would have had a shot.  All five of this year's nominees were on the Rabid Slate, yes.  But two of the five -- BLACK GATE and FILE 770 -- are clearly hostages, slated without their consent.  Despite the success of No Award in last year's voting, I think the presence of so many hostages this year changes the equation.   My hope is that fewer fans will resort to the Nuclear Option.  If so, I think FILE 770 will win here... but BLACK GATE would have given Glyer's zine its strongest competition.  Oh, and yes, No Award will be contending too.  TANGENT might have a very slim outside chance.  \r\n\r\nBLACK GATE's withdrawal changes all that, of course.  The big question is, what takes its place?  Whatever it is, I'd say that it instantly becomes a major contender here, just as THREE BODY PROBLEM became a contender last year after Marko Kloos pulled out of novel.  My guess is that the rocket goes to either FILE 770 or the new nominee...\r\n\r\n(One also wonders what will take place of the \"The Commuter,\" the Thomas Mays nominee in Short Story.  Mays has also withdrawn).\r\n\r\nSixth place has never been so crucial.","ditemid":484966,"eventtime":"2016-05-01 16:24:00","props":{"current_mood":"disappointed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, puppygate","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun May  1 22:24:45 2016]R [Sun May  1 22:24:47 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/726900198211899392 ","current_moodid":55,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1462312648,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/726900198211899392","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"sadface","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.659129286886987]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1462141654}","revtime":1462741613},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-05-01 22:24:42","anum":102,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html","event_timestamp":1462119840,"reply_count":36,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124302622/73354478","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349286#t24349286","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349286#t24349286","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349286#t24349286","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2902334","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24349286,"talkid":95114,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349286#t24349286","article":"But what can we do as individuals?","upictitle":"The Dragon Demands: pic#124302622","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"1 year ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"May 1 2016, 22:50:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"What do we do?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ADragonDemands","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2902334","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73354478&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ADragonDemands","ctime_ts":1462143034,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349798#t24349798","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349798#t24349798","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349798#t24349798","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24349798,"talkid":95116,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24349798#t24349798","above":24349286,"upictitle":"George R.R.

They've already had one. Asking for more amounts to special pleading on behalf of the Pups' preferred works and authors.<br /><br />If a Pup-favored book or story was published within the year of eligibility, <i>it has already had the same chance to be read, generate word of mouth, and find its audience, as all the other books and stories published during that time</i>.

While I've written about it in some depth at <b>ComicMix</b> (http://www.comicmix.com/2016/04/28/glenn-hauman-neil-gaiman-does-not-need-a-pity-hugo-award/), it occurs to me that with you, I can make my argument using extremely familiar metaphors-- to wit, \"Game Of Thrones\" and football.<br /><br />Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the 1940 college football game between Cornell and Dartmouth. Cornell came into the game with 18 straight victories over two years, while Dartmouth was 3-4 that season.. Dartmouth led 3-0 with less than a minute to play. A referee made a mistake on the field and ended up giving Cornell a fifth down instead of turning it over to Dartmouth. Cornell scored a touchdown on the fifth down and won, 7-3. The mistake wasn't discovered until after the game was in the books and officials viewed the films.<br /><br />The president of Cornell sent an offer to Dartmouth offering to forfeit the game, if they would accept it. Dartmouth did. Because that was the honorable thing to do. To claim a tainted victory would be unsportsmanlike.<br /><br />(Note that fifty years later, a similar last-minute fifth down happened between the Colorado Buffaloes and the Missouri Tigers, which has cast doubt on Colorado's claim to Division I-A's 1990 national championship ever since.)<br /><br />As for the second metaphor: \"Game Of Thrones\" was Emmy nominated for Best Dramatic Series in 2012, but lost to \"Homeland\". Would you think it fair that GOT won if a slate had put GOT on and kept \"Homeland\" and \"Breaking Bad\" off the final ballot? After all, \"Game Of Thrones\" was good enough to get nominated anyway, so it's no big deal if it would have won against a weakened field, right?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"May 2 2016, 06:46:23 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Honorable concessions and withdrawal from the field","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10209683453711452/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Glenn Hauman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3637839","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77878307&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Glenn Hauman","ctime_ts":1462171583,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24369510#t24369510","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24369510#t24369510","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24369510#t24369510","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24369510#t24369510","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24369510,"talkid":95193,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24369510#t24369510","above":24358502,"upictitle":"George R.R. Martin: Spain","article":"I think it is insulting and borderline offensive to talk about Neil Gaiman and Lois McMaster Bujold and Neal Stephenson winning \"pity Hugos.\"  I do understand the point you're making, but you don't need to couch it in such terms.<br /><br />As to the issue... no, the situation this year is far from ideal.  As I said at last year's Hugo Losers Party, the scenarios the Pups have created make losers of everyone, even the winners.  I know many of the hostages, and I know none of them wanted to be slated, and all, I am sure, would rather be competing against legitimate nominees, the best the year had to offer.<br /><br />That's not possible, however.  We have a bad situation here, and we need to make the best of it.  Your solution, having Neil and Neal and Lois and the rest withdraw, makes the bad situation much much worse, from where I sit.  It hands VD a total victory.<br /><br />My own priorities?  I think that in all cases the Hugo should go to a work worthy of the Hugo.  Something very good at minimum, and preferably great.  Something that will not make fans of the future do a double-take when they see it on the list of winners.  Neil Gaiman and Sandman?  Great stuff.  Certainly worthy.<br /><br />(And you keep talking about how Neil does not 'need' a Hugo, and ignoring his partner on this, the artist.  Neil may have a shelf of Hugo awards, but the artist doesn't.  This would be his first, and may be the only shot he'll ever have at one.  Also, if you going to argue that someone who has won Hugos in the past does not need any more, you should be consistent and extend the principle to all the other perennial winners.  Mike Glyer does not 'need' another Hugo either.  Connie Willis does not need any more.  Dave Langford probably did not need that tenth Hugo of his, and certainly not the fifteenth.  Etc Etc  Sometimes a writer or artist does indeed decide to retire or decline a nomination -- Neil himself has done that, just a few years back -- but most are always glad to add one more to the mantle.  I can't blame them.  That's only human.)<br /><br />As for your second metaphor... hoo hah, you really know nothing about the Emmy Awards, do you?  It's ALL 'slates' and campaigning. has been for decades.  HBO promotes and campaigns for its shows, sends out screeners, takes out ads.  Starz does the same for its slates, ditto Showtime, CBS, Fox, NBC, ABC, A&E, the History Channel, everybody.  All campaigns, all the time.  You don't promote, you don't compete, you don't get nominated.  In the end, though, the campaigns cancel each other out and the best stuff rises to the top anyway... usually.<br /> <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","below":24370278,"ctime":"May 2 2016, 22:31:44 UTC","parent":24358502,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Honorable concessions and withdrawal from the field","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1462228304,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126130201/77878307","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24373862#t24373862","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24373862#t24373862","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24373862#t24373862","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24373862#t24373862","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3637839","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10209683453711452/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24373862,"talkid":95210,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24373862#t24373862","above":24369510,"upictitle":"Glenn Hauman: pic#126130201","article":"My argument is not that someone who has won Hugos in the past doesn't need more, it's that someone who has won them in the past doesn't need <em>tainted</em> ones.

The voters showed last year that they are perfectly capable of giving No Award in a category if they don't think anything is Hugo-worthy.  When Orphan Black won last year, no one called it a Pity Hugo just because some of the other noms were on the RP slate.<br /><br />As for your Cornell versus Dartmouth game analogy, the comparison just doesn't work.  We don't know--and we'll probably NEVER know--what would have made it onto the ballot without Beale's minions being involved.  There's no way to tell an RP ballot from a non-RP ballot.  People can guesstimate, but they'll still just be guessing.  There's a big difference between people who willingly associate themselves with Beale and those who want nothing to do with him.  Many--if not most--of the people on his list probably didn't want to be there.  They shouldn't be penalized for it.  And this year, they all know that the voters are willing to vote No Award in many categories, not just one or two, so they all know they might get what is essentially a slap in the face from the voters.  Read/watch the works on the ballot and vote the way you would vote in any other year.  Don't let yourself get trolled by Beale.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","below":24370790,"ctime":"May 2 2016, 22:44:41 UTC","parent":24358502,"massactions":0,"subject":"RE: Honorable concessions and withdrawal from the field","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2246029","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Frank Probst","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2587046","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70873652&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Frank Probst","ctime_ts":1462229081,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126130201/77878307","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24375398#t24375398","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24375398#t24375398","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24375398#t24375398","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24375398#t24375398","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3637839","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10209683453711452/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24375398,"talkid":95216,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484966.html?thread=24375398#t24375398","above":24370278,"upictitle":"Glenn Hauman: pic#126130201","article":"Actually, we'll have a very good idea what would have made the ballot right after the nomination data is released.
