{"itemid":253,"subject":"Same Old Jets","event":"To be a Jets fan is to understand the meaning of pain.\r\n\r\nIt is, admittedly, a different sort of pain than that known by Lions fans, but no less sharp.  The Jets like to tease you with false hope, so the eventual defeat will cut deeper.\r\n\r\nIt is all Joe Willie's fault.  As every true Jets fan knows, he made a deal with the devil to win SuperBowl III.  So long as any Jets fan who saw that victory remains alive, the Jets will never win again.\r\n\r\nSigh.\r\n\r\n(I won't talk about the Giants this week.  The game meant everything to the Vikings and nothing to the G-Men.  I was heartened to catch glimpses of Danny Ware and Mario Manningham, however.  Both showed flashes, and David Carr did well enough as well, though Ghu Forbid that we ever actually need him).\r\n\r\nOne consolation for Jets fans.   At least they're not the Cowboys.","ditemid":64896,"eventtime":"2008-12-28 19:00:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":156,"current_moodid":38,"commentalter":1233637699,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","verticals_list":"life"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-12-29 02:05:33","anum":128,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html","event_timestamp":1230490800,"reply_count":85,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?replyto=4921216","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921216#t4921216","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921216#t4921216","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921216#t4921216","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rbauer1969","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rbauer1969.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4921216,"talkid":19223,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921216#t4921216","upictitle":"rbauer1969: pic#0","article":"If I had to put blame, I'd put it on the organization for taking a QB that was on his last leg (although he did ok last season, look at the seasons before that) and let him throw a zillion interceptions to lead them to where...nowhere.<br /><br />He had 3 more picks today.<br /><br />Shameful.<br /><br />And it was nice to see Chad get some revenge.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"December 29 2008, 02:08:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Jets","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rbauer1969.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rbauer1969","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rbauer1969","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rbauer1969.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rbauer1969","ctime_ts":1230516538,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?replyto=4921472","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921472#t4921472","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921472#t4921472","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921472#t4921472","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"beef_cleftchin","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://beef-cleftchin.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4921472,"talkid":19224,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/64896.html?thread=4921472#t4921472","upictitle":"beef_cleftchin: pic#0","article":"George:<br /><br />Perhaps instead of lamenting the Jets' collapse, you can be happy for your boy Chad Pennington.
