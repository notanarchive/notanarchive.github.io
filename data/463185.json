{"itemid":1809,"subject":"Last Year (the Cliff's Notes version)","event":"My giant Review of the Year Post got eaten by Live Journal.  \r\n\r\n That was very vexing.  I had spent the entire morning and part of the afternoon working on that post.  It was very long.  Lots of graphics too, book covers and party photographs, all sorts of stuff I had to find on my hard drive and load.  And in an instant it was gone.\r\n\r\n I don't have the time to energy to recreate it.  I probably could not even if I tried.  Nothing is as onerous as trying to rewrite something you've already written and lost.  \r\n\r\n So all I can give you, on this fine 2016 afternoon, is a sort of Cliff's Notes version.\r\n\r\n And to make sure I don't lose a lot of stuff again, I will break this up into a number of shorter posts rather than one epic one.\r\n\r\n So... where was I?  Oh, the lost post.  Well, the title was simply \"2015.\"  It was meant to be a review of my entire year, personal and professional.  And yes, I talked about WINDS, but I talked about a lot of things as well.  That was the sort of year it was.  \r\n\r\nMy opening statement was a crib from Dickens: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  Which pretty well sums up 2015 for me.  Lots and lots and lots of amazing stuff happened, and I felt that I wanted to stress that... most writers could only dream about the kind of year I had... but it was a year full of frustration and disappointments as well, a year of lows as well as highs...\r\n\r\n So let me get into that.\r\n\r\n In smaller posts.","ditemid":463185,"eventtime":"2016-01-01 14:49:00","props":{"current_mood":"quixotic","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"everyday life, computer woes","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Jan  1 21:48:36 2016]R [Fri Jan  1 21:48:37 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683042167309254656 ","current_moodid":105,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1451698060,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683042167309254656","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.649995174065472]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451685078}","revtime":1451698090},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-01 21:48:35","anum":81,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/463185.html","event_timestamp":1451659740,"reply_count":28,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125733561/77255340","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/463185.html?thread=23431249#t23431249","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/463185.html?thread=23431249#t23431249","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/463185.html?thread=23431249#t23431249","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3453575","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/andressilva","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23431249,"talkid":91528,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/463185.html?thread=23431249#t23431249","upictitle":"Andr S.

Granted you said that you wrote about many things in that original post, it just seems logical that given your stance on talking about The Son of Kong that you would re-think your momentary lapse of reason of writing about it. If I'm correct I believe that someone at Live Journal needs to be fired for whatever the mistake was! <br /><br />Anyway, I look forward to hearing anything about the book but please know that there are those of us who realize that all the updates in the world are insignificant until you can say, \"My part is done and Winds will be on the shelf in \"x\" months.\"  Looking forward to reading that post.

I love reading your blog because (despite its name) it is more of a blog than those of most famous people (where it is either just mindless drivel to keep people following them, or just pure marketing that they aren't involved in).<br /><br />I don't follow football, but I love seeing the passion you have for it. And I admire how you stand up for those who are under unfair attack, be it the Hugo's fiasco, or Syrian refugees. That you organised the Alfies to mend some of the damage caused by the rabid puppies, put a huge smile on my face. It was a wonderful and inspired gesture proving once again that good spirit can stand strong in the face of hate.<br /><br />But most of all, I really enjoy hearing about your love for Santa Fe, and all the work you are doing for it. I would love to visit some day, and check out the Jean Cocteau (and try some of your famous popcorn!), but that may have to unfortunately wait some time, as I have a young family that is naturally my highest priority these days.<br /><br />I think those who come to your blog only to see (and in some cases even demand) updates on Winds are missing out on its true value.

It automatically does this.  So if there's suddenly a power outage, or a cat jumps on the keyboard and closes my browser, whatever, I can get back most of what I wrote.
