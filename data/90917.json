{"itemid":355,"subject":"Videogame Rights Optioned","event":"For years now fans of my epic fantasy series A Song of Ice & Fire have been writing and emailing me to suggest... ask... beg for the books to be made into a videogame.   I'm thrilled to be able to announce that, at long last, those requests are being answered.  Cyanide Studios, an independent videogame developer based in Nanterre, France, has acquired an exclusive option to develop Ice & Fire as both an RTS (Real Time Strategy) and RPG videogame for next generation consoles and PC.\r\n\r\nCyanide will begin development  immediately, with an eye toward rolling out the games for release in the summer of 2011.  \"We are all huge fans of 'A Song of Ice and Fire', so it is a true honour for our teams to be entrusted with creating the first video games inspired by this masterpiece\" said Patrick Pligersdorffer, Managing Director of Cyanide. \"The twists and turns of the plot will allow us to deliver an experience which can be enjoyed by both long-time fans as well as gamers new to the series.  Its rich web of characters, set in a universe where nothing is just black and white, make it an ideal background for both an RTS and an RPG.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000581we/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000581we\" width=\"173\" height=\"126\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n \r\nCyanide first approached me about videogame rights five years ago.  No agreement was reached at that time, but Patrick and his colleague Joe Ryan have maintained their interest in the series over the years, impressing me with their doggedness and determination.  Since that first contact, Cyanide has opened a studio in Montreal and more than doubled its headcount, and now have the resources to produce both RTS and RPG games that will, we hope, satisfy all my fans and readers, and gamers unfamiliar with the books as well.  I am pleased to be in business with the Cyanide,  and look forward to working with them on the games.\r\n\r\nCyanide was founded in 2000, and has developed and produced games in numerous genres, including sports management, real time strategy, fantasy, and action RPGs.

Some good crafters of video games in the fantasy RPG genre are Bioware and Bethesda. Bioware is coming out with a new game called \"Dragon Age\" and shares many similarities with settings in Westeros. Bethesda's unique style and it's \"Elder Scrolls\" series also prove it can develop great fantasy RPG experiences. Day and night I dream of one of these firms licensing an Ice and Fire game. <br /><br />While I am absolutely thrilled that someone finally realized the market potential for a SoIaF game, I reserve judgement for the qualities of these games. Perhaps I will be surprised. However, I think this is a milestone for us Ice and Fire fans. If nothing else, this will serve to attract other teams to try their hands on an Ice and Fire video game.

On the other hand, their budgeting and marketing may not be as great. My worry about a game from either BioWare or Relic would have been that it would have felt like a traditional BioWare RPG or a traditional Relic strategy game first and an ASoIaF-specific product second.

It is going to be a tall order.<br /><br />2011 does sound a little ambitious (especially for 2 full games.)  I hope that Cyanide subscribes to the \"it's done when it's done\" school of though rather than the \"it's done because the deadline is coming up.\"  Too many games are rushed out.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"June 8 2009, 20:24:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dgabbott.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dgabbott","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dgabbott","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dgabbott.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dgabbott","ctime_ts":1244492689,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/90917.html?thread=6365477#t6365477","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/90917.html?thread=6365477#t6365477","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/90917.html?thread=6365477#t6365477","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"proudbronco","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://proudbronco.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6365477,"talkid":24865,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/90917.html?thread=6365477#t6365477","upictitle":"proudbronco: pic#79896655","article":"Gaaaaaaaaaaah, nerdgasm....and that was a strong one. <br /><br />Sweeeeeeet!
