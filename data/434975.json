{"itemid":1699,"subject":"Speaking of Awards...","event":"The clock is ticking.  Only two weeks remain to cast a ballot for this year's Hugo Awards, in what is proving to be the most controversial and hotly contested Hugo race in the award's long history.  The Hugo, as regular readers of this Not A Blog know, is our field's oldest and most prestigious award.  Named in honor of Hugo Gernsbach, the founder of the first SF magazine <i><b>Amazing Stories</b></i>, it has been given annually at every worldcon since 1953 (well, except for 1954).   And this year, as never before, the voice and vote of every true fan is needed to help protect the integrity of the rocket.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/260706/260706_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/261190/261190_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nYou need to be a member of Sasquan, this year's worldcon, to vote on the Hugos... but even if you are unable to attend, Supporting Memberships are available that will allow you to vote.  If you have not voted the Hugo Awards before, please note that it is an \"Australian ballot,\" a preferential system whereby one ranks the nominees. You don't just vote for one. You can rank NO AWARD as if it were any other finalist; ahead of some nominees, behind others.\r\n \r\nYou can sign up to buy one at https://sasquan.swoc.us/sasquan/reg.php  In addition to voting privileges, a Supporting Membership will get you the convention's program book (usually a handsome item, though it varies from year to year) and other publications.\r\n\r\nThe ballot is here: http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/voting/\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/261628/261628_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/261735/261735_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nYou can also sign up as an ATTENDING member and actually attend the convention, which is the course I strongly recommend for those who have the time and the money. Cons are fun, especially worldcon; that's what they are all about. Reading, panel discussions, the art show, the dealers' room, the masquerade, filksinging... all sorts of great stuff goes on. Something for all tastes. And EVERYONE is welcome, despite what you have heard. (Just don't be an asshole. Assholes get welcomed too, but the welcome wears out more quickly).\r\n\r\nBoth supporting and attending members get an electronic \"Hugo packet\" that will enable you to read many of the works nominated for this year's rockets. \r\n\r\nFILE 770, which has been doing an exemplary job of reporting on Puppygate, reports that Sasquan memberships continue to climb, and that more than 2300 Hugo ballots have already come in:\r\n\r\nhttp://file770.com/?p=23818\r\n\r\nWho are all these new Supporting Members?  Are they trufans rallying to the defense of one of our field's oldest and most cherished institutions?  Are they Sad Puppies, Rabid Puppies, Happy Kittens, Gamergaters?  Are those dreaded SJWs and ASPs and CHORFs turning out by the hundreds and the thousands?  Are these the Neo-Nazis and right-wing reactionaries we have been warned of?  The truth is... no one knows.  We may get a clue when the ballots are opened and counted, but even then, the numbers may well just say, \"Answer cloudy, ask again.\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/261906/261906_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nAll I know for sure is that every vote will count.  \r\n\r\nOnce again, balloting closes at midnight on July 31.  And it would be best not to wait until the last day to vote, since there is a very real danger that Sasquan's servers could be overloaded.  Even if you haven't finished all the reading -- and I do urge everyone to read the nominees -- you can cast a partial ballot today, and go back and revise, add, delete, and change as many times as you want between now and July 31.  No votes will be counted until the deadline.\r\n\r\nLet this be fandom's finest hour.  Vote.","ditemid":434975,"eventtime":"2015-07-17 14:08:00","props":{"current_mood":"determined","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, puppygate","current_moodid":45,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1438154866,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Speaking of Awards... http://goo.gl/CKrxDY","picture_keyword":"hugo","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.660287573866754]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1437163721}","revtime":1438198833},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-17 20:07:54","anum":31,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html","event_timestamp":1437142080,"reply_count":47,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22082079#t22082079","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22082079#t22082079","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22082079#t22082079","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22082079#t22082079","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3231231","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/116178701053726451306","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22082079,"talkid":86258,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22082079#t22082079","upictitle":"Tom Root: pic#0","article":"What's the story with that Ultraman statue?

And the San Antonio base is stunning as well.  I think it was Orlando where the Hugo base actually included a piece of the Saturn V gantry -- it was not as eye-catching as the others, but deserves props just for historic coolnees.<br /><br />On the other hand, there have been some truly ugly base designs as well.  The New Orleans 1988 Hugo is infamous.  And of course the Aussiecon 3 Hugo HAD to be spectacular to make people forget the Hugo from Aussiecon 2, which featured something that was supposed to be a miniature Ayers Rock but looked more like a scoop of salmon mousse.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 17 2015, 23:30:24 UTC","parent":22083615,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"July 17 2015, 23:32:38 UTC","dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1437175824,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/44863184/8286274","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084383#t22084383","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084383#t22084383","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084383#t22084383","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"soon_lee","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://soon-lee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22084383,"talkid":86267,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084383#t22084383","above":22083871,"upictitle":"Soon Lee: Saccharomyces","article":"I believe they should be <a href=\"http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-trophies/2010-hugo-award-trophy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aussiecon4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-trophies/1999-hugo-award-trophy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aussiecon3</a> respectively.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","below":22084639,"ctime":"July 18 2015, 02:45:09 UTC","parent":22083871,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://soon-lee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"soon_lee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"soon_lee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://soon-lee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"soon_lee","ctime_ts":1437187509,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084639#t22084639","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084639#t22084639","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084639#t22084639","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"soon_lee","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://soon-lee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22084639,"talkid":86268,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084639#t22084639","above":22084383,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","parent":22083871,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://soon-lee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"soon_lee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"soon_lee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://soon-lee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"soon_lee","ctime_ts":1437187633,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084895#t22084895","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084895#t22084895","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084895#t22084895","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3231469","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/118419722376464669708","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22084895,"talkid":86269,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434975.html?thread=22084895#t22084895","upictitle":"jonathan pierce: pic#0","article":"George I want to sincerely thank you for all of your effort spent shedding light on this issue.  I find myself to be a fringe SF/Fantasy reader that has fallen away over the years, and thanks to your not-blogging regarding it I have become more and more involved.<br /><br />It has been 20 years since I have gotten seriously into reading great fiction, and if it wasn't for the puppies and their slates, as well as the reaction to it I would not have.  Three Body Problem was so amazing, it is certainly at the top of my list.  I have become a supporting member of this years world con, though I wont be able to make it, I will be attending next year's MidAmeriCon.  <br /><br />Thanks to you I learned about ConQuest, and participated in my first ever SF/Fantasy Convention.  Attending GRRM and Brandon Sanderson's panels was simply outstanding.<br /><br />The way you ended your first paragraph with \"every true fan...\" made me sharply inhale, as I know that statement will whip the puppies into a frenzy.  However polarizing issue this has become, I have gotten to read some great fiction, not so much the nominees this year (a lot of 'meh'), but I decided to go back and read the Hugo Winners from the last 20 years.  None of this would have happened if this years contest hadn't of been gamed by the slates.<br /><br />Eric Flint and yourself have been great voices of reason, and hopefully you will see that your cat herding has paid off.  I was so impressed by Mr. Flint's writing, argument, and logic I decided to pick up his grand series first novel 1632.  My initial thought was that the premise was childish, but then wow, great writing.  I am currently working through the 6th book in the series.
