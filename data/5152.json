{"itemid":20,"subject":"The Heart of a Small Boy","event":"For a science fiction or fantasy writer, there is no bigger honor than being named Guest of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention.  (Yes, I know, the field has other awards for lifetime achievement, most notably SFWA's Grandmaster Award, but for me that will always rank second).  The honor comes with an obligation, however -- you have to give a speech at the con.\r\n\r\nOf course, any writer who's been around for a few years has probably given dozens of speeches at regional cons and book signings, in addition to sitting on hundreds of panels, so none of us are exactly strangers to public speaking.  Some writers have a standard speech for all occasions, a one-size-fits-all sort of talk.  Others write a new speech every year or two.  Some wing it.  If you are really hard up and/or lazy, you can even take questions from the audience, or ask to do an interview instead of a speech.  I confess, I have resorted to all those dodges in my time, at one con or another.  \r\n\r\nA worldcon is different, though.  It's the biggest honor most of us will ever get, unless the Pulitzer Fairy or the Nobel Prize Santa Claus should somehow take note of us, and it requires a real speech.  Something major, memorable, substantive.  A speech with some meat on its bones.  Probably Robert A. Heinlein's fault.  At the first of his three worldcon GOHships, in 1941, he set the template with his famous \"time binding\" speech and gave fans something to talk about for years (the speech he gave at his third GOHship in 1976 was rambling and incoherent and ended abruptly in mid sentence when the alarm clock on his podium went off, but never mind, third time can't always be the charm, and RAH was not in the best of health by then).\r\n\r\nMy own worldcon GOHship was in 2003 at Torcon III.  I began agonizing over the right topic for that speech from the moment Toronto won the bid, and I worked on the text off and on for most of the year leading up to the convention... which might explain why I was so cheesed off when LOCUS reported afterward that I hadn't given a speech, but did an interview instead (for the record, I gave a speech AND an interview).  I wasn't too thrilled by the small room that Torcon put me in either, a far cry from the grand ballrooms where the Guests of Honor always spoke when I first started attending cons in the early 70s...\r\n\r\nNever mind, though.  It wasn't my intend to complain, but to praise.  I've just got gotten my copies of a new anthology from ISFic Press, edited by Mike Resnick and Joe Siclari.  WORLDCON GUEST OF HONOR SPEECHES, it's called, and I'm astonished that no one thought of doing this sort of book earlier.  Resnick and Siclari collect thirty-one GOH speeches in one attractive hardbound package, from Frank R. Paul's address at the very first worldcon in 1939 to Christopher Priest's talk at last year's Glasgow con.  Heinlein's famous 1941 speech is here (but not his 1976 speech, mercifully), along with Philip Jose Farmer's infamous 1968 speech, two talks by the late great Robert Block, and speeches from such luminaries as Theodore Sturgeon, Donald A. Wollheim, Fritz Leiber, Doc Smith, Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison, and many others, all too many of whom are no longer with us.  Even Hugo Gernsback himself is represented, the man for whom the Hugo Awards are named.  (Siclari and Resnick have also included my own Torcon speech, \"The Heart of a Small Boy,\" so if you're one of those who couldn't squeeze into that cramped little room in Toronto, or one of those who believed LOCUS and thought I did not give a speech, here's your chance to read what I said).\r\n\r\nThe book is not complete, alas.  There are as many speeches missing as there are included, sad to say, and some of those may well be lost to us.  That's certainly understandable when we're talking about the 40s and 50s, half a century ago; most of those writers are dead, and it may be no one thought to write down what they said.  More puzzling, however, is the fact that the entire decade of the 90s seems to be missing, save for Joe Haldeman's speech from the 1990 worldcon in the Hague.  Those writers are still around, mostly, and you'd think that some of them would have saved the text of their speeches... \r\n\r\nOh, well.  That's a cavil, and we can hope that some more of those talks will turn up in the future, and make for a great second edition.  What Siclari and Resnick have given us is good enough.  If you're interested in the history of SF, the history of worldcons, the history of fandom, or would just like to sample the words and thoughts of some of the giants who built this field, this is a book you need to have.  I imagine there will be copies available at this year's worldcon in LA.  Those not planning to attend can order this from the ISFic Press website at\r\nhttp://www.isficpress.com/WGOH.html\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of LACon IV, Connie Willis is the GOH at that one.  You won't want to miss HER speech, I promise you.  I don't know what her subject will be, but knowing Connie, she's been working on the speech for two years, and it's sure to be as provocative as it is hilarious, and I'm certain that LACon will give her a room big enough to hold everyone who wants to hear her.","ditemid":5152,"eventtime":"2006-08-05 13:35:00","props":{"commentalter":1156920898,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2006-08-05 20:34:52","anum":32,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html","event_timestamp":1154784900,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/80423412/3649629","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?replyto=124192","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=124192#t124192","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=124192#t124192","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=124192#t124192","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ikorose_shinsou","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ikorose-shinsou.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":124192,"talkid":485,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=124192#t124192","upictitle":"Sara: Mask","article":"I'd love to attend some of these cons someday... :) <br />And great book!

We sent Connie an advance copy of the book when review copies were sent out.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"August 7 2006, 20:48:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://shsilver.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"shsilver","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"shsilver","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://shsilver.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"shsilver","ctime_ts":1154983697,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?replyto=130592","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=130592#t130592","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=130592#t130592","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=130592#t130592","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=130592#t130592","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":130592,"talkid":510,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=130592#t130592","above":130336,"upictitle":"George R.R.

That is a rare blood disease which affects only 8 people out of a million each year, and those 8 per million are divided among 22 distinct forms of amyloidosis. They are distinct enough that while some have no treatment at all, for the others, the treatment that works on one will have no effect whatsoever on any of the rest. An amyloid is a misshapen or misfolded protein that can be produced by various parts of the body and which may deposit in other parts of the body (nerves or organs) with varying effects. (As a small oddity, amyloids are associated with a wide list of diseases ranging from carpal tunnel syndrome to Alzheimer's. There's no current evidence of cause and effect, and none of these is considered any form of amyloidosis, but the amyloids are always there. So it is entirely possible that research on amyloids may one day lead to cures for Alzheimer's and the Lord knows what else. I've offered to be a literary poster boy for the Mayo Amyloidosis Program, and the May PR Department, at least, seems very interested. Plus, I've discovered a number of fans in various positions at the clinic, so maybe they'll help out.) <br /><br />Now in my case, what I have is primary amyloidosis with cardiomyapathy. That means that some (only about 5% at present) of my bone marrow is producing amyloids which are depositing in the wall of my heart, causing it to thicken and stiffen. Untreated, it would eventually make my heart unable to function any longer and I would have a median life expectancy of one year from diagnosis. Fortunately, I am set up for treatment, which expands my median life expectancy to four years. This does NOT mean I have four years to live. For those who've forgotten their freshman or pre-freshman (high school or junior high) math, a median means half the numbers fall above that value and half fall below. It is NOT an average. <br /><br />In any case, I intend to live considerably longer than that. Everybody knows or has heard of someone who was told they had five years to live, only that was twenty years ago and here they guy is, still around and kicking. I mean to beat him. I sat down and figured out how long it would take me to write all of the books I currently have in mind, without adding anything new and without trying rush anything. The figure I came up with was thirty years. Now, I'm fifty-seven, so anyone my age hoping for another thirty years is asking for a fair bit, but I don't care. That is my minimum goal. I am going to finish those books, all of them, and that is that. <br /><br />My treatment starts in about 2 weeks at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where they have seen and treated more cases like mine than anywhere else in the US. Basically, it boils down to this. They will harvest a good quantity of my bone marrow stem cells from my blood. These aren't the stem cells that have Bush and Cheney in a swivet; they can only grow into bone marrow, and only into my bone marrow at that. Then will follow two days of intense chemotherapy to kill off all of my bone marrow, since there is no way at present to target just the misbehaving 5%. Once this is done, they will re-implant my bmsc to begin rebuilding my bone marrow and immune system, which will of course go south with the bone marrow. Depending on how long it takes me to recuperate sufficiently, 6 to 8 weeks after checking in, I can come home. I will have a fifty-fifty chance of some good result (25% chance of remission; 25% chance of some reduction in amyloid production), a 35-40% chance of no result, and a 10-15% chance of fatality. Believe me, that's a Hell of a lot better than staring down the barrel of a one-year median. If I get less than full remission, my doctor already, she says, has several therapies in mind, though I suspect we will heading into experimental territory. If that is where this takes me, however, so be it. I have thirty more years worth of books to write even if I can keep from thinking of any more, and I don't intend to let this thing get in my way. <br /><br />—Robert Jordan <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"August 9 2006, 12:53:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Robert Jordan","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1155128037,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?replyto=284704","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=284704#t284704","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=284704#t284704","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=284704#t284704","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":284704,"talkid":1112,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/5152.html?thread=284704#t284704","article":"\"...which might explain why I was so cheesed off when LOCUS reported afterward that I hadn't given a speech, but did an interview instead\"<br /><br />George, you gave a dammn good speech.
