{"itemid":1567,"subject":"Wild Cards World Junket","event":"Something old and something new... that&#39;s ACES ABROAD,&nbsp; scheduled to be re-released by Tor in a new, expanded trade paperback edition on Tuesday (January 13).\r\n\r\nThe fourth volume in the original Wild Cards series of mosaic novels, ACES ABROAD is set in 1987, and tells the tale of a global fact-finding junket sponsored by the World Health Organization, to investigate the conditions of aces and jokers around the world.&nbsp; The original book contained stories from Stephen Leigh (featuring Puppetman) , John J. Miller (Chrysalis), Leanne C. Harper (the Hero Twins), Gail Gerstner Miller (Peregrine), Edward Bryant (Wyungare), Walton Simon (Jayewardene and the Great Ape), Lewis Shiner (Fortunato), Victor Milan (Mackie Messer), Melinda M. Snodgrass (Dr. Tachyon), Michael Cassutt (Polyakov),&nbsp; and my own linking interstitial &quot;Journal of Xavier Desmond&quot; (starring Xavier Desmond, of course).\r\n\r\nAll of those are here, for anyone who missed them first time around... but to sweeten the pot, we&#39;ve added two brand new originals for this new edition.&nbsp; Kevin Andrew Murphy takes center stage with the untold tale of Troll&#39;s adventures in Peru, and we visit Prague with Lady Black and Carrie Vaughn.\r\n\r\nWe also have a brand new cover, another spectacular piece of art from Michael Komarck.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"big\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/231501/231501_900.jpg\" title=\"big\" />\r\n\r\nOld stories, new stories, great new art...&nbsp; you can preorder a copy from Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Cards-IV-Aces-Abroad/dp/0765335581/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420919494&amp;sr=1-1, or pick it up Tuesday from your favorite local bookstore or online retailer.","ditemid":401306,"eventtime":"2015-01-12 13:19:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, anthologies, publications","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1421300890,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Wild Cards World Junket http://j.mp/1y4g6Jv","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.616062879246622]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1420921191}","revtime":1421872290},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-01-10 20:18:52","anum":154,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html","event_timestamp":1421068740,"reply_count":9,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124424418/4158581","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081050#t20081050","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081050#t20081050","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081050#t20081050","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"eowyn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://eowyn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20081050,"talkid":78441,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081050#t20081050","upictitle":"Lauren: Eleven/Amy Love","article":"Shrek, is that you? :P","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 10 2015, 23:55:40 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://eowyn.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"eowyn","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"eowyn","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://eowyn.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"eowyn","ctime_ts":1420934140,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081818#t20081818","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081818#t20081818","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081818#t20081818","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20081818,"talkid":78444,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401306.html?thread=20081818#t20081818","above":20081050,"upictitle":"George R.R.
