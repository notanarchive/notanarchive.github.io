{"itemid":689,"subject":"Leaving Lizard","event":"Our last morning on Lizard Island.  We're off in about an hour for Sydney.  Signing there tomorrow at Galaxy Bookshop.  See their website or mine for details.\r\n\r\nLizard was wonderful.  Amazing snorkeling.  And we made some new friends.  Reginald the Gull, Larry the Lizard, Clem the Clam... parting is such sweet sorrow.\r\n\r\nNot QUITE crossing paths with our friends Melinda Snodgrass and Ian Tregillis, who arrive here next week.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the real world, the NFL season is about to begin.  We will try to catch the games via the internet, but I don't know if we'll uscceed.  So please, no football spoilers here unless I post about the game results.\r\n\r\nOh, and I hear HBO is planning some sort of GAME OF THRONES promo in connection with the TRUE BLOOD season finale.  No, I don't know what it will be.  I'm way way out of the loop here on the bottom of the world.  Hope it's coool.","ditemid":176397,"eventtime":"2010-09-12 10:53:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1284356230,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":164,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"18:7,45:3,8:7,10:3,31:3,37:7,1:7,3:21,25:17,5:3,4:10,26:17,20:3,9:14,13:14,nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1284358071},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-09-12 00:53:52","anum":13,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html","event_timestamp":1284288780,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/61556877/10865290","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029005#t11029005","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029005#t11029005","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029005#t11029005","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"philmophlegm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://philmophlegm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11029005,"talkid":43082,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029005#t11029005","upictitle":"philmophlegm: raidersshield","article":"If you've got a decent broadband connection, NFL Gamepass is excellent for watching games.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"September 12 2010, 01:15:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://philmophlegm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"philmophlegm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"philmophlegm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://philmophlegm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"philmophlegm","ctime_ts":1284254102,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/70417226/680014","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029261#t11029261","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029261#t11029261","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029261#t11029261","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cailin_t","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cailin-t.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11029261,"talkid":43083,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029261#t11029261","upictitle":"no thank you: kestrel","article":"hopefully we get more than that 20 seconds of out of focus black and white woods this time.  ;)  ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"September 12 2010, 01:20:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cailin-t.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cailin_t","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cailin_t","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cailin-t.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cailin_t","ctime_ts":1284254410,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/73670670/15369582","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029773#t11029773","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029773#t11029773","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029773#t11029773","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"limerick_jim","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://limerick-jim.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11029773,"talkid":43085,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176397.html?thread=11029773#t11029773","upictitle":"limerick_jim: frisbee ultimate","article":"hey George if your NFL game pass doesn't work try www.atdhe.net how i watch the G-men and Gang Green here in Ireland!

I was introduced GoT a few weeks ago by a \"friend\" who insisted that I HAD to read your series. Of course, she neglected to tell me that only four of the planned seven books were in print. Nor did she mention the horrific cliffhangers I would encounter throughout the series and the sleep I would lose because I had no choice but to read long enough to be certain that my favorite character didn't go the way of Lord Eddard. (I can't tell you how many times I cursed your name and swore that if you killed off my beloved Tyrion I wasn't reading one more word! You've been warned, sir!)<br /><br />It was the most delightful, emotionally draining reading experience I've had in quite a long time.<br /><br />Having devoured all four books now, I am waiting on tenterhooks to find out what happens next. The entire series is astonishing in scope and complexity, but Tyrion (in my mind, at least) is one of the great heroes of contemporary literature. THANK YOU for creating him and this amazing universe.<br /><br />At the insistence of my friend who didn't want me spoiled on who lived and who died, I avoided everything online until I had finished Crows. Half-way through the series, though, I learned about the upcoming HBO series based on Game of Thrones. I immediately began mentally casting, and once I was able to get online to scavenge for crumbs, I was overjoyed to learn that the only actor I could envision for Tyrion had gotten the part!<br /><br />Seeing him in tonight's preview was thrilling. (I'm overjoyed that they made the decision not to load him down with prosthetics.) The whole texture of the series looks wonderful and I can hardly wait. My friends and I are already planning a big premiere party.  You're invited, of course, but if you can't make it, we'll understand and drink a toast to your good health and prolific pen!<br /><br />Once again, deepest thanks from a devoted new fan.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"September 13 2010, 05:07:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The preview was Fabulous!
