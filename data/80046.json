{"itemid":312,"subject":"Hugo nominations","event":"Well, this year's Hugo Award nominations are in.  You can check out the full list at:\r\n\r\nhttp://anticipationsf.ca/English/Hugos\r\n\r\nFor several years now I have been beating the drum on this blog and elsewhere, urging more people to nominate.  \r\n\r\nThe good news is, nominations are up sharply this year.  Denvention III received 483 valid nominating ballots, Anticipation has announced 799.  That's a very impressive spike.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is, well, almost none of the stuff that I nominated made the ballot, and I'm not crazy about a lot of stuff that did.  \r\n\r\nBut at least more people are nominating.\r\n\r\nNow comes the vote.  The categories have all been winnowed down to a short list.  Go ye forth and read.","ditemid":80046,"eventtime":"2009-03-20 01:40:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":124,"opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":55},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-03-20 07:49:16","anum":174,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80046.html","event_timestamp":1237513200,"reply_count":0}
