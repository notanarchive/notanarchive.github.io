{"itemid":431,"subject":"3-0, 3-0","event":"Life is magical and full of joy.\r\n\r\nTwo more victories for my New York teams today.  The Giants totally dominated Tampa Bay, holding them to under a hundred yards of total offense, shutting down their run game completely, pitching a 24-0 shutout.  On offense, Jacobs and Bradshaw both ran the ball convincingly, Eli and the receivers looked sharp.  The Scottish Kicker did miss a chip shot field goal, probably because the commentators jinxed him by mentioning his name.  That, and a few new injuries, were the only flies on what was otherwise a complete victory.  I am especially worried about Kareem McKenzie, who was carried off on a cart.  The G-Men have looked very strong to date, but the injuries have really started to pile up, and that is worrisome.\r\n\r\nThe Jet game was much more exciting.  Dressed in their throwback New York Titans unis, the Jets jumped off to a fast 14-0 start and for a bit the game looked like a blowout.  But a fumble changed the momentum and the Titans (in their throwback Oiler unis) came roaring back in the second and third quarters to go ahead 17-14.  Then came another turnover, and Big Mo shifted back.  The last quarter belonged to the Jets.  Sanchez had some trouble with the wet ball, but played pretty well, all in all.  Jericho was a beast, especially on that long catch.  The Jets special teams were outstanding.  And the defense... what was especially impressive was how much Rex changed his game plan from last week.  Gone were all the blitzes.  Instead the Jets focused on shutting down the Tennessee running game, their strength, and were successful.  \r\n\r\nThe weirdest thing was that the two games were being played simultaneously, which I don't recall ever seeing before, in all my years of watching football.  I had to switch back and forth between them on my TiVo, and inevitably some plays got spoiled for me.\r\n\r\nNext week the Giants go to Kansas City for their third road game in a row, and the Jets face their sternest test yet when they go to New Orleans to play Drew Brees and the high-flying Saints.","ditemid":110440,"eventtime":"2009-09-27 23:41:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1254544074,"personifi_word_count":366,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"18:20,35:17,11:5,37:7,32:5,3:30,25:17,4:5,39:5,20:5,9:10,21:5,13:22,nterms:yes","revtime":1254117333},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-09-28 05:54:56","anum":104,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html","event_timestamp":1254094860,"reply_count":56,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/92853803/39131","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html?replyto=7532392","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html?thread=7532392#t7532392","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html?thread=7532392#t7532392","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html?thread=7532392#t7532392","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html?thread=7532392#t7532392","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"princess_vernie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://princess-vernie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7532392,"talkid":29423,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/110440.html?thread=7532392#t7532392","upictitle":"Never lost at sea...: crystal","article":"Start preparing yourself for disappointment next week!
