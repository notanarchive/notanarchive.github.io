While Westeros is clearly a knitting of the medieval Europe, and there you can't really point out a specific location, in certain places \"across the sea\",we have cities like for example Braavos, which immediately remind me of Venice (Italy), with its canals, being established as a commercial and banking power and multi-cultural metropolis.<br />There is Volantis, an exotic and old city, divided in half by a great river, and I can clearly see traces and hints of Istanbul (or Constantinople) in Turkey.<br />And the great cities of Slavers Bay, with its high pyramids and brutal slave based economy and way of living, which immediately remind me of the City-States of the mesoamerican cultures such as the Mayas.<br />I hope you find the time to answer this, and that you have a safe return back home.<br />All the best!<br />Cheers from Portugal<br />PD","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"April 22 2012, 10:36:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Memory plays tricks when reaching certain levels of excitment :(","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://daddydoom.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"daddydoom","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"daddydoom","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://daddydoom.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"daddydoom","ctime_ts":1335090979,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117029227/48745021","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/277427.html?thread=15880115#t15880115","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/277427.html?thread=15880115#t15880115","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/277427.html?thread=15880115#t15880115","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1173478","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000200684043","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15880115,"talkid":62031,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/277427.html?thread=15880115#t15880115","upictitle":"Claudia Carvalho: pic#117029227","article":"Me and my boyfriend went to the signing at Lisbon, it was crowded and we had to wait like 2 and a half hours to have our books signed, but the wait was totally worth it!

I see your books and the first thing that comes to mind is, \"sword... throne... okayyy (rolls eyes)\". The books didn't interest me at all, until I saw a picture of Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke on my classmate's FB account. And then, she mentioned something incest blah blah blah and pretty character names. So, curious as I was, I googled the names, saw Daenerys and Khal Drogo (as they were portrayed on TV), read their love story on wiki (don't blame me sir, I was born a girl), googled the other characters, got headaches reading the names  on family trees, etc. <br /><br />But, I have A Clash of Kings in my hands right now, and three other books are waiting for me at home. I didn't tell my mom how much they cost me (all 5 of them bought at once), lest she behead me. Got to finish this before Season 2 of the series spoils it for me again. *sigh*<br /><br />Oh, sorry for the long post. Before I forget, a big, big THANK YOU, Ser Martin!
