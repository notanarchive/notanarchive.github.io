I don't know what you would call that other then trying to get to the ball carrier and disrupt the play - in essence, making a tackle or at the very least contributing to a tackle. We can debate exactly what it was he intended, but the fact remains he didn't take himself out of the play. Players make plays, they don't worry how cool it looks. If McCray had stood aside and allowed Warner to get to the ball because he was worried about what a hit on the QB would look like, that would of been \" not cool \". <br />    In a situation like a turnover, the league can't make a rule that prevents players from hitting the QB and at the same time allows the QB to make tackles. They would have to prevent both, and woe to the player who, in the chaos of a fumble or interception, runs into the QB while he's just standing there like a referee. And I find it hard to believe a QB in position to stop a score would give up on the play for the sake of a rule. While some may be more concerned about their salaries then a potential game saving play, I would think the majority of QBs would simply disregard such a rule in a situation like that.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"January 23 2010, 21:31:37 UTC","parent":8356868,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Both Good Results","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://commonstock-d.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"commonstock_d","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"commonstock_d","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://commonstock-d.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"commonstock_d","ctime_ts":1264282297,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/9340329/1072299","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/127236.html?replyto=8336644","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/127236.html?thread=8336644#t8336644","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/127236.html?thread=8336644#t8336644","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/127236.html?thread=8336644#t8336644","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"leprechn13","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://leprechn13.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8336644,"talkid":32565,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/127236.html?thread=8336644#t8336644","upictitle":"Pat: pic#9340329","article":"Hey George,<br /><br />Don't know if you like the sport, but there will be a lacrosse game at the Meadowlands on April 10th, Syracuse versus Princeton.

BUT I'm such a fan of the NFL that they are my new favorite team for the remainder of the season.  Why?  The Jets beating the Chargers (long shot! I know) and then the Colts (not as much of a long shot) would be poetic.  After all, the Colts let the Jets in the playoffs by pulling their starters and essentially giving the game (and the chance of a Perfect Season???) away.  I realllllly hated that.  Being a Fins fan, the Jets losing was one of the 14 things that had to happen on the final Sunday for the Fins to make it in. LOL  BUT more importantly, I think the integrity of the league and each and every game of the regular season should be preserved, after all... it's 16 games.  Why play 15 2/3 perfect and then just give up?  Bc Peyton might get hurt?  C'mon.  He might trip in the parking lot and pull something on a curb.  Should they also golf cart him around and place pillows around him during the week?   It's football, people.
