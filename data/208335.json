Now, it's fine if you didn't like the ending, but damning it as bad because you didn't like it, that's where I have to call you out.<br /><br />Here's the rub - regardless of whether you liked or disliked the ending of LOST, the writers seemed rather pleased with it, because they believed that they had told the story to their specifications.  More important than delivering answers to a show that, from the outset, couldn't have all of them, they decided to be true to the *story* instead.  They wrote the ending of LOST to be the ending of LOST, not the fan version where we understand the why of everything.<br /><br />What's troubling is that you seem to indicate that you *don't* want to do this.  Please, please, please, don't be tempted to write characters or plot lines to fit what *we* want, because, honestly, we're a bunch of unwashed Neanderthals that won't be pleased under any circumstances.  We'll want to know why X happened or demand that you wrote Y character wrong or Z should have lived or whatnot.  You're never going to please all of us.  Every single one of us is going to have a gripe, even if we love it from first word to last.<br /><br />So don't try to please us.  And when we whine and mewl and pitch a fit and tell the New Yorker that we don't want our next endeavor to \"pull a Martin,\" you can look back and say \"To hell with 'em, I wrote the story that needed to be written.\"<br /><br />It's *your* story, just like it was the LOST writing team's story.  You do with it what you want.  You write it how it needs to be written.  The only person you really need to satisfy is yourself, and by extension, the story itself.  I think by this point, you've earned enough of a following to do as you please with it.<br /><br />Just like the LOST staff did.<br /><br />So please, do a LOST.  Write the story that needs to be written the way you want to write it.

Mr. Martin will be the first to tell you that he's messed up in his PR/estimations of completion along the way. <br /><br />I have been reading since 1996 and I can tell you that I understand where they're coming from, even if I don't agree with their methods. The debate about whether or not readers are owed a conclusion is not as crazy as some here would like to make it seem. <br /><br />I'll explain before everyone throws eggs at me: Serials (which is what ASoIaF is) are sold with the explicit understanding that there will be a conclusion at some point. I think that is why Mr. Martin is feeling so much pressure to get it right, and why this process has been so incredibly tough for him. <br /><br />Personally, I am glad he cares so much and am really pulling for him to finish a book that he's happy with. These detractors simply don't believe that he's been frank with them, that there is some great conspiracy on George's part to deprive them of what they feel they deserve. Mr. Martin's relative silence about Dance these past couple of years only served to reinforce these fears.<br /><br />So I get it. I mean, if anything it is a testament to Mr. Martin;s sheer skill as a story teller that people are getting so riled up. I like the emotion, if not the execution. <br /><br />I must say, Elio's devotion is bordering on OCD to hear the author tell it.

Growing up in Chile, you'll excuse me if my access to pop culture was a bit more limited in the pre-wikipedia times. Then I bought the first Wild Cards anthology and got the story straight. I was actually drawn to \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" (partly) because of Wild Cards, and not the other way round. <br /><br />Now I found out that this pilot I caught on cable way back when, that I still want to see more of, about that weird chick from another dimension, and the hero doctor, the fuel eating bacteria and the guy that I can only asume was going to get killed in every episode, was also written by you. <br /><br />I think was 13 at the time, so I might be over indulgent, but my memories of it are quite positive. Please tell me: was Spiderman one of the faces carved on that alternate Mt. Rushmore or is that just my memory tricking me? I have a fuzzy recollection of that. I really wanted to know what was up with THAT reallity.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it is so cool the way you're discreetly yet firmly woven into geek pop culture, and to recognize that subtle presence you've had in my life for so long, from Vincent to JetBoy to Tyrion.
