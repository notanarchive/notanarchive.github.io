In ASOIAF there are many descriptions of Valyrian Steel swords. Ice is described as dark as smoke. And the swords Tywin reforged from Ice are described as having black and red ripples. Is the typical color of Valyrian Steel black? Or is it something else? Could you give us a description of the color? I appreciate your time in reading this and hope you can give an answer.","upictitle":"blackeyedlily: HG Hand in Air","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"7 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"September 30 2016, 23:59:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The Color of Valyrian Steel","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://blackeyedlily.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/userhead/422?v=1318258971","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"blackeyedlily","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"blackeyedlily","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://blackeyedlily.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"blackeyedlily","ctime_ts":1475279966,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/6426307/831977","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499988.html?replyto=25049108","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499988.html?thread=25049108#t25049108","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499988.html?thread=25049108#t25049108","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499988.html?thread=25049108#t25049108","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"boblovesdot","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://boblovesdot.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25049108,"talkid":97848,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/499988.html?thread=25049108#t25049108","upictitle":"Guardian Bob: bad-ass","article":"mmmm... swords!<br /><br />I got married with a sword on my hip.
