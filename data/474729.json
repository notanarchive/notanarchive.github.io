If you post something on social media, it has a significant affect on your world. If you want to be a teacher, don't post photos of you holding beer on facebook. If you want to be an elected official, in Administration, or in entry level business, don't post anything that may be controversial. Stay quiet, get in line, and don't draw attention to yourself.<br /><br />This cultural suppression has spilled into my writing. I'm afraid to write scenes depicting sex, rape, death-etc. I'm afraid of being attacked, silenced, or judged because I am creating a real-world situation that happens daily. I was deeply disturbed that Sansa was raped, deeply, but I know that is what you meant me to feel when you wrote it. You wanted me to understand the complexities of humanity, and our deep secrets we shove aside in favor of only remembering the triumphs. The world is not always well-meaning, it's not always sterilized, it's not always kind. I feel like that has been forgotten by so many authors, and they write it in as something to overcome. <br /><br />Thank you.
