{"itemid":1890,"subject":"The Puppy Wars Resume","event":"I've had most of the day to consider the new Hugo ballot and what it means, and to read some of the online commentary.  The ballot, as I said in my first post, is very much a mixed bag.  Some categories are much improved from what we were offered last year.  Some are worse.  Some <i><b>much </b></i>worse.  \r\n\r\nThose of us who hoped this year's massive turnout might give us something more palatable than last year were mistaken; the 2016 ballot and the 2015 ballot are pretty much a wash.  The two editor's categories are much stronger than they were last year.  Novel has some very fine and worthy choices (though my own favorite novels from last year are missing).  Some talented young writers are up for the Campbell.  On the other hand, Best Pro Artist is a joke, Short Story is if anything <i><b>weaker</b></i> than last year, and Best Related Work is a toxic swamp.  \r\n\r\nIt's too late tonight to go through the list category by category, though.  We have months to do that, so I will leave you all to do it for yourselves.  We will have a Hugo packet eventually, which will make the process easier.\r\n\r\nIt is important, for those of you who may not have been following the awards controversey closely, to note that three important things happened since last year:\r\n\r\n     (1) MidAmericon II reported a record number of nominating ballots, more than 4000, almost double the previous record.  In addition to MAC members, those who were members of Sasquan and the forthcoming Helsinki worldcon were also eligible to nominate,\r\n \r\n      (2) Sad Puppies 4, this year headed by Kate Paulk, changed its approach and produced a recommended reading list, with anywhere from one to ten suggestions in each category, rather than slating four or five.  The process was open and democratic, which Sad Puppies 3 often claimed to be but never was.  Paulk also avoided the ugly excesses of the previous campaign, and never stooped to the sort of invective that her predecessor, Brad Torgersen, had been so fond of, with all his talk of CHORFs and Puppy-kickers.  For all this she should be commended,\r\n\r\n      (3) in contrast, the far right Rabid Puppies did a slate, as before.  However, VD played it cute this year, peppering his lists with poison pills by including some major, popular works by well-known authors, works everyone knew to be contenders regardless of any Puppy support, along with the usual spate of mediocrity and a few choice picks that appear to be purely \"fuck you\" choices.\r\n\r\nSo how did all these factors intersect?  \r\n\r\nThe record turnout seemed to have no impact.  Fandom nominated in huge numbers, but it would appear that they did not nominate the same things.  They scattered their nominations among dozens, perhaps hundreds, of possible choices.  We won't know the full story till we see the complete list of nomination totals on Hugo night... but I suspect (unless MAC cuts the list short) that we'll see many more titles than we're used to.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened to the Sad Puppies.  By shifting from Torgersen's slate to Paulk's list of recommendations, they suffered the same fate as many other recommended reading lists, be it the LOCUS list or the Nebulas or my own recommendations.  They had almost no impact on the ballot.  The Sads did get works on the ballot when their choices overlapped with the Rabids, to be sure, but very few works that were \"sad only\" made the list.  SP4 was a non-factor.  (And before someone else points this out, let me be the first to admit that the Sads had more impact than I did.  As near as I can tell, I batted .000 on my own recommendations, which just goes to show that all this talk of about my immense power is somewhat exaggerated.  No wonder I never get invited to the meetings of the Secret Cabal).\r\n\r\nThe big winners were the Rabid Puppies, whose choices completely dominated the list.  The Rabids had nominees in every category, I believe, and in a few categories they had <i><b>ALL</b></i> the nominees.   Mike Glyer has a nice breakdown on FILE 770: http://file770.com/?p=28616  It seems obvious that while traditional fans and the Sad Puppies have minds of their own, the Rabids just vote the way they are told to vote. \r\n\r\nWe should remember that this was just the nominating round.  The final vote is still ahead.  How will that turn out?  Well, that's up to you guys.  Helinski pre-supporters and Sasquan members could nominate, but they cannot vote, so the ultimate winners will be decided by the members of MidAmericon II.   So join.  Read.  Vote.  You can sign up here: http://midamericon2.org/\r\n\r\nOne last point.  The Rabids used a new tactic this year.  They nominated legitimate, quality works in addition to the dross.  Works by writers like Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, Neal Stephenson, Alastair Reynolds (Reynolds went public well before the nominations asking NOT to be slated, but they slated him anyway), Andy Weir, and several others.   Some of these writers are apolitical (like Weir), while others are known to oppose everything that VD stands for (Gaiman, Stephenson, King).  One has to think they were deliberately targeted.  \r\n\r\nIn some of the online comments I've seen, these writers are being called \"shields.\"  I've even read some people calling for them to withdraw, simply because they were on VD's list.  \r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">Withdrawing is the <i><b>LAST</b></i> thing they should do.  </span>\r\n\r\nI urge them all to stand their ground.  They wrote good books, stories, graphic novels, they did NOT take part in any slate.  In some cases they were largely unaware of all this.  In other cases they explicitly denounced the slates ahead of time (Reynolds, again).  Punishing them... demanding they turn down this honor... simply because VD listed them is insane.  \r\n\r\nMarko Kloos and Annie Bellet did the right thing by withdrawing last year.  Their was an ethical and courageous act; I applauded them then and I applaud them now.  But this is a different year and a different situation.  Given the well-known political views of some of these writers, it seems plain to me that VD and the Rabids picked them deliberately, in hopes they would withdraw, or would be voted under No Award.  They would probably have put Scalzi (VD's best bro) on the ballot too, but he outsmarted them and withdrew before they could.  \r\n \r\nI am rather hoping that several of them win.  Based on quality alone, some deserve to.   Sure, VD will claim that as a victory, but as last year proves, he claims everything as a victory.  We'll know the truth.  The only real victory for him would be having any of these fine writers pull out.  Let's not play his game.  \r\n\r\nAnyway... I am sure we'll all have much more to say about this in the months to come.  Fasten your seat belts, friends.  It is going to be a bumpy ride.\r\n\r\n(Oh... and yes, for those who were asking.  This does mean we will need a second set of Alfies).","ditemid":483848,"eventtime":"2016-04-27 01:56:00","props":{"current_mood":"irritated","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Apr 27 07:56:36 2016]R [Wed Apr 27 07:56:38 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/725232170495700992 ","current_moodid":112,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1462000689,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/725232170495700992","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.668290743244078]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1461743841}","revtime":1462000721},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-27 07:56:35","anum":8,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html","event_timestamp":1461722160,"reply_count":168,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/111343425/39034864","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24279560#t24279560","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24279560#t24279560","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24279560#t24279560","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24279560#t24279560","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_677722","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RA_Whipple","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24279560,"talkid":94842,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24279560#t24279560","upictitle":"R.

Seeing some of these categories, with amazing content on there, is a relief. Others, it’s like being crushed with a concrete block.<br /><br />But I’m torn. As I’m sure you’ve seen, Tales to Terrify, StarShipSofa's sister horror podcast, made the ballot. At first, we all couldn't be happier at District of Wonders, especially the folks over at TTT. Hugo Award for one, a Hugo nom for another. For two out of three DoW podcasts. That's got to be a record. <br /><br />But it’s on this year.<br /><br />And it could very well taint us. Because Vox Day threw it up on his website - a fact that disgusts me. The same with Pierce Brown, Daniel Polansky, Alastair Reynolds, Nnedi Okorafo. All of them amazing writers. All of whom would have gotten on the ballot regardless of the Puppies.<br /><br />All of them - and us - under threat of the Noah Ward. Because that's what VD wants. To rub it in our faces. Scalzi has the right of it when he says they're just trying to take credit for ruining the Hugos. There’s no way in hell they had more power than Gaiman, King, Stevenson, etc. They’re trying to discredit their names.<br />Let’s not let them do that. Don’t give them more credit than they’re worth.<br /><br />Ultimately, we're happy that Tales to Terrify got a Hugo nomination. But I'm also worried that the whole Noah Ward and ballot association would drag us down. I don't know how many of you know this, but TTT founding host and editor Larry Santoro died just under two years ago from cancer. He gave TTT everything he had and the whole community adored him. He was absolutely dedicated not only to diversity, but showcasing newer writers alongside bigger ones. He was a powerhouse – we all loved him and it crushed us all when he passed. The fact that Tales to Terrify got this nomination now and was supposedly bloc voted on not only threatens to undo everything he and the team worked on, but soil his reputation as well.<br /><br />Not getting the award? Not a big deal.<br /><br />Having Larry’s legacy and the years he spent working on the podcast dragged through the mud? Quite a big deal. <br /><br />It’s a mixed bag result. Knowing that people thought we were worthy is amazing and awesome. But knowing that all that Larry’s work could be wiped out like this is troubling. I can’t even imagine what his widow is thinking right now.<br /><br />But from where I stand, pulling out is the last thing we, and others, should do. We’re going to be judged and evaluated either way. But we’re not going to let Day win. He doesn’t deserve that. He doesn’t get to destroy these special moments and destroy reputations. <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 27 2016, 10:03:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Torn in two","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/821617077932553/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jeremy Szal","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3186391","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76171284&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"April 27 2016, 16:57:54 UTC","dname":"Jeremy Szal","ctime_ts":1461751409,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24305672#t24305672","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24305672#t24305672","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24305672#t24305672","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24305672#t24305672","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"marcaramini","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://marcaramini.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24305672,"talkid":94944,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24305672#t24305672","above":24281608,"upictitle":"Marc Aramini: pic#0","article":"Larry's work could never be tainted.

However, I don’t trust a system that is so hard to understand and I feel like it might somehow deter what should be a democratic process (though logically I might understand that it doesn’t).<br />I actually believe that there is no need to modify the nomination rules at all just because of some people that only want promoting and who nominate (as we have seen with Neiman or King) hoping to get other authors to retire the nominations that they justly deserve, to  destroy our freedom of choice and to eventually make the Hugos less worthy.<br />We should not modify the existing rules of the nomination process. Nonetheless, we could take measures so that slates don’t reduce our choices in the final ballot by adding a Protocol in case of Slates.<br />For each category in the final ballot, we could have our five most voted non-slated nominations AND all the slated nominations that ranked higher than the fifth non-slated one.<br />That would make a longer list of candidates in the final ballot, but all those that would have been selected where not for the Rabids’ slate would also be part of it.<br />Then it would be a matter of finally making a GOOD USE of No Award and filter all those works that don’t deserve a Hugo and then order our preferences of those that do.<br />It’s true that by doing so we would recognize the Rabids (or any slate) existence, but at the same time we would deprive them of their power. If they nominate some unworthy stuff, never mind, we still have our picks and theirs go under No Award. If they nominate something good that much more people would approve of and would probably have contended anyway, okay some less known non-slated author or artist got a boost and some publicity from being nominated. If they create more than one slate, then their votes will be divided and they will weed themselves out of the final ballot.<br />The only disadvantage I can see is that they do will get some promotion, but they are getting that anyway and also enjoying the current confrontation. Hopefully, with this protocol they would eventually see that their endeavor  is fruitless and then they can continue making slates or get bored and let the Hugos be what they were a few years ago.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 27 2016, 12:22:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Why change the Hugos?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/100421217894007754877","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"arien 2","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3627070","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77842692&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"arien 2","ctime_ts":1461759768,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/96744317/4545815","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24297992#t24297992","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24297992#t24297992","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24297992#t24297992","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24297992#t24297992","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kevin_standlee","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24297992,"talkid":94914,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24297992#t24297992","above":24282888,"upictitle":"Kevin Standlee: Hugo Logo","article":"How do you decide what is on a \"slate\" and what is not?

While that is how some awards programs work (and they then do not tell you that they did so, nor are they required to do so), the Hugo Awards administrative process, the rules for which are written by the members of the Worldcon, not some Secret Select Cabal, is designed to require a great deal of openness (despite what its critics would claim), and Administrators aren't supposed to use much or any subjective judgement. I try to warn people that you really don't want an Administrator to be able to throw out a ballot using the criteria \"I personally didn't like this choice,\" or \"I ascribe specific motives to this individual, and therefore won't count it.\"<br /><br />We'll hear a lot about No Award in the months to come. The way I've approached it in the past (not just last year) and continue to approach it is this:<br /><br /><strong>If you don't think a finalist deserved to be on the ballot at all, don't rank it, and vote No Award somewhere on your ballot.</strong><br /><br />This is the most straightforward way of \"downvoting\" a finalist. Rank anything you want to win above No Award. When you get to the point where you don't think any of the remaining finalists deserve to be on the ballot, rank No Award and stop ranking candidates. But remember that \"did not deserve to be on the ballot\" and \"I didn't personally like it\" are two different things. In fact, they're not even mutually exclusive. You can personally like something but think that it did not deserve to have a place on the Hugo Award shortlist.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 27 2016, 15:29:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kevin_standlee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kevin_standlee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kevin_standlee","ctime_ts":1461770983,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24286472#t24286472","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24286472#t24286472","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24286472#t24286472","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24286472#t24286472","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3626800","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/116514376797032705001","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24286472,"talkid":94869,"etime_ts":"1461772286","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483848.html?thread=24286472#t24286472","above":24285704,"upictitle":"Red Zen: pic#0","article":"So, more of the same.
