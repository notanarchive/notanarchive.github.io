Pike Street, in Seattle.&nbsp; There will be an opening reception at the gallery on Saturday, March, 1, and a final special engagement at Emerald City Comicon, March 28 - 30th.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s no secret that I love fantasy art, so I&#39;m very excited about this show.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had the honor and privilege of working with incredible artists like Michael Komarck, John Picacio, Gary Gianni, Marc Simonetti, Charles Vess, Jeff Jones, John Howe, Marc Fishman, Donato Giancola, Stephen Youll, Tom Kidd, and many many more in the past, and it&#39;s my hope that some of them will be sending brand new original pieces for inclusion in the show... along with many new artists, some of whom may very well win places in my personal pantheon.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing all sorts of wild, new, exciting visions of my world and characters.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the gallery website at http://www.ltdartgallery.com/\r\n\r\nArtists who would like to submit their work for consideration for inclusion in the show should contact James Monosmith at the gallery email.\r\n\r\n(At this date, I can&#39;t promise that I will be able to attend the gallery opening.&nbsp; But if I can, I will).</div>","ditemid":343534,"eventtime":"2013-10-29 16:54:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"santa fe","taglist":"artwork, song of ice and fire, fantasy, art collecting","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1387053860,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":4,"interface":"web","revtime":1383503456},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-10-23 22:54:42","anum":238,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343534.html","event_timestamp":1383065640,"reply_count":12,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121403519/49487085","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343534.html?thread=18375662#t18375662","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343534.html?thread=18375662#t18375662","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343534.html?thread=18375662#t18375662","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1208390","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/rayfeighery","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18375662,"talkid":71779,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343534.html?thread=18375662#t18375662","upictitle":"Ray Feighery: pic#121403519","article":"Really Exciting News!
