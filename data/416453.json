My faithful minions have just translated the first Alayne chapter from WordStar and uploaded it to my website.\r\n\r\nYes, I know, I'd said there would be no more sample chapters, but (1) it had been more than a year since Mercy, (2) lots of you were asking, and (3) Anne Groell and my friends at Bantam twisted my arm.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it. But whether you love it or hate it, please go to Westeros or Tower of the Hand or one of the other bulletin boards to talk about it. Not here. \r\n\r\n(I would have put it up yesterday, but I did not want it mistaken for an April Fool's joke)","ditemid":416453,"eventtime":"2015-04-02 11:25:00","props":{"current_mood":"chipper","current_location":"Seattle","taglist":"writing, a song of ice and fire, the winds of winter","current_moodid":99,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" A Visit to the Vale http://j.mp/19Nako7","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":3,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.721495862671278]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428361266}","revtime":1428361208},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-02 18:25:02","anum":197,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/416453.html","event_timestamp":1427973900,"reply_count":0}
