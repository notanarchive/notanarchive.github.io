{"itemid":313,"subject":"Another Monkey Off My Back","event":"Gardner Dozois and I have completed work on our WARRIORS anthology, and delivered it to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, our editor at Tor\r\n \r\nThis one is a monster, a gigantic \"event\" anthology with an all-star lineup of writers, most of them award winners and bestsellers in their own fields. The theme of the anthology is war and the warrior ethos... but what makes WARRIORS different from all the military SF anthologies that have gone before is that this one is a cross-genre anthology. Fantasy, SF, historical fiction, suspense, mainstream, romance, and more, all of it was welcome here.  \r\n \r\nOur final lineup:\r\n \r\nIntroduction: \"Stories  from the Spinner Rack,\" by George R.R. Martin\r\n\"The King of Norway,\" by Cecelia Holland\r\n\"Forever Bound,\" by Joe Haldeman\r\n\"The Triumph,\" by Robin Hobb\r\n\"Clean Slate,\" by Lawrence Block\r\n\"And Ministers of Grace,\" by Tad Williams\r\n\"Soldierin',\" by Joe Lansdale\r\n\"Dirae,\" by Peter S. Beagle\r\n\"The Eagle and the Rabbit,\" by Steven Saylor\r\n\"Seven Years from Home,\" by Naomi Novik\r\n\"The Custom of the Army,\" by Diana Gabaldon\r\n\"The Pit,\" by James Rollins\r\n\"Out of the Dark,\" by David Weber\r\n\"The Girls from Avenger,\" by Carrie Vaughn\r\n\"Ancient Ways,\" by S.M. Stirling\r\n\"Ninieslando\" by Howard Waldrop\r\n\"Recidivist\" by Gardner Dozois\r\n\"My Name is Legion,\" by David Morrell\r\n\"Defenders of the Frontier,\" by Robert Silverberg\r\n\"The Scroll,\" by David Ball\r\n\"The Mystery Knight,\" by George R.R. Martin\r\n \r\nThere's twenty stories, all original and never before published, including a Forever Peace \r\nsequel from Joe Haldeman, a \"Lord John\" novella by Diana Gabaldon, an Emberverse tale from Steve Stirling, and a major new Dunk & Egg novella from yours truly.  Vikings, doughboys, Roman legionaries, knights, Buffalo soldiers, cybernetic infantry, WASPs, Cossacks -- you'll find them all in the pages of WARRIORS.\r\n \r\nLook for the Tor hardcover in March 2010. \r\n\r\nSo far there's no UK sale, nor any foreign deals on the table.  Those may come later... but until and unless they do, if you want to read \"The Mystery Knight\" or any of the other stories, you'll need to grab the Tor edition.\r\n\r\nBuy early and often, and help us smash these genre boundaries!  It's the story that matters, not the label... at least that's our mantra here.","ditemid":80313,"eventtime":"2009-03-24 12:18:00","props":{"taglist":"tor","current_moodid":90,"commentalter":1238525913,"current_music":"Sixteeen Tons","personifi_word_count":377,"picture_keyword":"ape","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revtime":1237936193},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-03-24 18:27:04","anum":185,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80313.html","event_timestamp":1237897080,"reply_count":69,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/27129566/2990495","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80313.html?replyto=5686457","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80313.html?thread=5686457#t5686457","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80313.html?thread=5686457#t5686457","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80313.html?thread=5686457#t5686457","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dgsiii","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dgsiii.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5686457,"talkid":22212,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80313.html?thread=5686457#t5686457","upictitle":"dgsiii: pic#27129566","article":"Congratulations!
