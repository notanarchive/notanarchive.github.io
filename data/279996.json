It's been the perfect memorial day adventure.  I've been playing for almost 15 hours straight and never a dull moment.  The story is as close to being written by GRRM himself as I can tell.  I was expecting a totally different story, but so far it's one of the main stories that run through the entire series...and for many of us it's the most important series, though that is open to subjectivity.  I'm really enjoying the story.<br /><br />The voice acting and lip synching is top notch.  The game-play features are excellent.  I particulary like the combat mechanics with slow-motion allowing selection of up to 3 character actions in advance.  It's very well thought out and seamlessly implemented.  <br /><br />The downsides are the fixed 3rd persion view...during some conversations I'm staring at a wall and during some battles in tight corners I can barely see anything at all.  I'm hoping there is a way to switch the view to 1st person so I can see what's going on.  I've already modified the controls so I can move the character and camera at the same time with just one mouse button, but I still need some tweaking...essentially in PC video games the mouse is always moving the camera angle unless there's a dialog box or menu.<br /><br />And there's something that prevents a deeper immersion by the way the textures for the arms don't line-up with the torso textures at the shoulder joints.  The arms' textures are extending over the torso texture.  It's due to their inexperience with the more detailed animation that is required.  More experienced developers use clippers, link-meshes, and other techniques to prevent shoulder textures from separating from torso textures and thus give the appearance that the character has shoulder joints which move underneath skin and cloth.  The Unreal 3 Engine that is being used has these features because I've played other games which has the required effect.  <br /><br />I hope the game is a commercial success so that they can fix those few defects and release another game using another of the main storylines.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"May 27 2012, 18:13:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"A decent RPG...well done Cyanide","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://stevewood.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"stevewood","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"stevewood","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://stevewood.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"stevewood","ctime_ts":1338142419,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117490936/49888242","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279996.html?thread=16045244#t16045244","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279996.html?thread=16045244#t16045244","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279996.html?thread=16045244#t16045244","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1229956","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=626581935","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16045244,"talkid":62676,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/279996.html?thread=16045244#t16045244","upictitle":"Eric Martinez: pic#117490936","article":"I realize there are some issues with the game, that said, I absolutely loved it.
