The fact that so many readers are hungry for this kind of book is, of course, testimony to the amazing depth of this world we love being immersed in.

I, like so many others, am anxiously awaiting the next installment, The Winds of Winter, and for the time being this makes a great hold-me-over.<br /><br />I know that a tremendous amount of fan pressure is put on you to finish your next novel as quick as possible(with all ridiculous rumors flying every which way but true), but as a true fan, and writer, I would prefer that you take as much time as is needed to make certain that every character's arc is well thought out and well written, as has always been your style. Not many people truly appreciate the amount of time that it requires to put so much accurate detail into a work, and as they say, \"the devil is in the details\", it is those precious details that give your characters, and your world(I could say \"our world\" because many of us feel as though we are living it right alongside Tyrion, Arya, and so many other of our beloved characters) a feeling of truth and realism that is very difficult to attain.<br /><br />You are a constant inspiration to an aspiring writer such as myself, and from what I've read about you, a true fan of all forms of art. Congratulations as well on the purchase of your new \"bowling alley\". I hope that once it is open I can find the time to plan a trip to Santa Fe to visit it.<br /><br />I know I speak for your entire fandom when I say, thank you for all the wonder that you have given us and that you will continue to give us.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />A fan","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 9 2015, 15:54:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Terrific Companion Book for a Terrific Series","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rms771984.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rms771984","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rms771984","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rms771984.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rms771984","ctime_ts":1420818897,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400605.html?thread=20074717#t20074717","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400605.html?thread=20074717#t20074717","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400605.html?thread=20074717#t20074717","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2956005","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/112030329126511863446","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20074717,"talkid":78416,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400605.html?thread=20074717#t20074717","upictitle":"Joseph Achman: pic#0","article":"I don't usually ask for books for Christmas.
