{"itemid":781,"subject":"A Pox on Both Your Houses","event":"Regular readers of this Not A Blog will know what a fanatic fan of the NFL I am.\r\n\r\nI cannot possibly express how disgusted and pissed off I am by the failure of the NFL owners and players to reach an agreement, which has now led to a lockout and may possibly imperil the 2011 season.  There are no good guys in this scenario.  It is millionaires versus billionaires, and it's all about greed, greed, greed.  \r\n\r\nDon't believe what Gordon Gekko told you. Greed is not good.  Greed sucks.\r\n\r\nWhen the pie is as big and rich and gooey as the NFL's, the inability of the principals to come to any agreement about how to slice it up is just obscene.  \r\n\r\nLocking out the players?  Owners, shame on you.\r\n\r\nDecertifying as a union so you can sue?  Players, shame on you.\r\n\r\nThe last bit is ESPECIALLY offensive in the light of what is happening in places like Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio, where real working class people are fighting desperately to keep their unions in the face of a concerted effort by the Radical Right to strip them of their right to collective bargaining.  The teachers in those states are battling for their pensions, their health care, and salaries in the mid five figures, while NFL players decertify to make certain their seven figure salaries don't get trimmed down to six.\r\n\r\nHere's a proposal for you: the legislatures in every state with an NFL franchise should pass a new tax.  For every game missed due to a strike or lockout, the franchise owners should be required to take all the money they would have paid the players, and pay it instead into a pool to fund teacher salaries, benefits, and pensions.\r\n\r\nOh, to be the king.  Oh, to have some dragons.","ditemid":200039,"eventtime":"2011-03-09 12:23:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl, politics","current_moodid":2,"commentalter":1300484139,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":305,"picture_keyword":"sad sack","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"2:5,17:16,18:10,10:5,11:2,57:2,37:13,23:5,36:5,16:16,3:10,19:8,9:40,13:13,nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1301848526},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-03-12 19:22:41","anum":103,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html","event_timestamp":1299673380,"reply_count":88,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93490984/15995588","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12509287#t12509287","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12509287#t12509287","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12509287#t12509287","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"matthewrodney","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://matthewrodney.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12509287,"talkid":48864,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12509287#t12509287","upictitle":"matthewrodney: absurd!","article":"I agree with you.

The issue here is that the owners are walking away from a collective bargaining agreement that they signed because they think they should be making more profit.

Good pay, sure, but pretending that every player is getting Albert Haynesworth money is simply inaccurate. Heck, most of them aren't getting Brady Poppinga money. The median NFL salary is 770k, which means that half of the players earn less than that. It's a lot of money, but if your career is 3 years long and you face serious physical damage for playing the sport, we're not talking anything nearly like the wealth of the billionaires who own the

Which, given the spate of really serious health issues retired players have to deal with (dementia and such) simply from playing, is a really big deal.<br /><br />Now the owners want to extend the season solely to make more money, which would shorten the careers of some players while exposing them to greater health problems. I can understand why the players went with the nuclear option and de-certified the union so they could sue. It's legitimately life and death for them.<br /><br />The salaries disgust me too, but it's helpful to think about it as a really big pie, and the players deserve their slice of it too.

The problem is that the player's union has done a piss poor job of getting their message out to fans. What the owners are proposing with the added games and other issues rarely affects the superstar player with more money than they know what to do with - it's the majority of players, not the Peyton Mannings or Tom Brady's or other anomalies. Most of the players make a nice wage, but certainly if considered over the course of a lifetime - it's really not that much money, especially given the level of talent they must have AND the scores of residual health problems they face. Most of these guys are kids that hope to create a better life for themselves and their families - not to wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills. By adding additional games purely for greed, the owners are putting the players in even greater peril without changing the rules of insurance that really affects 90% of the player's body. I think the player's union has done a horrible job conveying that to the public. Oh and yeah - they aren't on strike, they are locked out. Big, huge difference.

Haven't workers got what they strove (and legitimately suffered) for? Labor laws now work on behalf of the individual (as all rights laws are meant to, according to the Constitution).<br /><br />So why are union leaders still addressing the system like it's the 1800s? Maybe I'm naive (hell, I'm still young!) because I don't have a union to \"represent\" me, but I don't see the point of the structure of the union anymore. This is America- if you feel wronged, you take your issue to the party that wronged you. If one person is wronging many people, then the odds are stacked against them in both the courtroom and the office. <br /><br />The concept of unions worries me because politics in itself is a rotten deal, and the union figure in itself is just compounding those politics.

Here, the employers said to the domestic staff, essentially \"Even though you don't speak English well, or at all, you must sign this new contract that reduces your wages and other conditions, right now, in this room, without benefit of a translator, or a union rep, or be taken off the payroll.  You may not take away the new contract to get advice or have it translated.\" <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%232\">#2</a> Aer Lingus (Ireland's national airline). Here, they said to the stewards \"We're just unilaterally changing your rosters, so that you have no idea from day to day when you'll be working. This may have the effect of making childcare arrangements literally impossible, but the side-effect of forcing people with children (therefore, demographically, likely to be older and therefore more senior/better paid) to resign is *completely* coincidental.\"<br /><br />It took union action in both cases to preserve workers rights, using  industrial action to even get the employers to agree to use the Labour Court mechanism.<br /><br />And sometimes, as in Wisconsin, somebody tries to take your rights away anyway.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","below":12568935,"ctime":"March 13 2011, 08:34:18 UTC","parent":12529767,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bastun_ie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bastun_ie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bastun_ie","ctime_ts":1300005258,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12568935#t12568935","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12568935#t12568935","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12568935#t12568935","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"spacediamond","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://spacediamond.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12568935,"talkid":49097,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12568935#t12568935","above":12536679,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","parent":12529767,"massactions":0,"subject":"While I see what your getting at...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://spacediamond.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"spacediamond","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"spacediamond","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://spacediamond.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"spacediamond","ctime_ts":1300140126,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12530791#t12530791","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12530791#t12530791","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12530791#t12530791","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12530791,"talkid":48948,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/200039.html?thread=12530791#t12530791","upictitle":"George R.R.

Guys who give it their all to manage just a couple years in the league generally are there by effort over natural talent.  That tends to also mean special teams involvement, which inevitably will be shown to have a high correlation with concussions.  Until the owners put their health at risk, let the little guy players get a decent cushion for their post football careers.<br /><br />Now, I agree they should have open finances, open to all the public (I wonder if it could be made public as a requisite for anti-trust status, for all sports, heck, for all anti-trust exempts!).  <br /><br />But my second thought is that the owners should also be on the hook for the medical treatment costs and disabilities which result in their farm system, the NCAA.
