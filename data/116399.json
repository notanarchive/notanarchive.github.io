{"itemid":454,"subject":"A Pair of Starks","event":"One of the hardest parts to cast was Bran.  When the story opens he's a cute kid, off to see a man beheaded for the first time.  But after that... think of all the challenges that await the boy in this role.  We think we've found a young actor capable of handling them, however.  His name is Isaac Hempstead-Wright.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00076qb2/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00076qb2\" width=\"100\" height=\"140\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nMy clues for this one are pretty self-explanatory.  Hempstead is a town in Nassau, and Isaac was the Biblical sacrifice (not really, of course, Yahweh was just joking around).  All the same, I was astonished when some of you managed to puzzle them out.  Isaac is a bright young talent and he gave a great reading, but I figured he was google-proof.  Not so.  I'm looking forward to seeing him bring Bran to life.\r\n\r\nAlso cast, as his uncle and Lord Eddard's younger brother Benjen, a ranger of the Night's Watch, is Joseph Mawle.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00077y6r/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00077y6r\" width=\"102\" height=\"124\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00078zr3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00078zr3\" width=\"108\" height=\"81\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnother fast-rising British actor, Mawle has portrayed both Jesus and Judas, starred in a film called FREEFALL, and began his acting career at the Tobacco Factory Theater.
