{"itemid":701,"subject":"Two for the Road","event":"Froggy would like to hint around with you madmen some more, but Andy is too damn tired right now.  It's less than a week before I fly off to Ireland, and I'm still exhausted from the long trip to Australia... so I will forgo the games this time around and just tell you straight out that David & Dan and HB0 have filled two more roles for GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nThe part of Hot Pie will be played by a newcomer named BEN HAWKEY.  And as Lommy Greenhands, we will have EROS VLAHOS, best known for his role in the \"Nanny McPhee\" movies.\r\n\r\nBEN HAWKEY\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000d49qg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000d49qg/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"189\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nI hear some of the purists pointing out that Lommy and Hot Pie don't actually appear in the first novel.  You're not wrong.  In the books, they don't appear until the first Arya chapter of A CLASH OF KINGS... but they'll be in season one, looks like.\r\n\r\nOther announcements should be coming soon, though it's not likely that I'll be the one making them.  I'll be packing or flying to Ireland, and afterwards to Malta.  We've very close to naming actors for the roles of Stiv and Ser Meryn Trant, waiting only HBO approval, and Nina and D&D have been looking at Kevan Lannisters as well.
