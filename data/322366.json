{"itemid":1259,"subject":"MEATHOUSE MAN Is Coming","event":"Nowadays they call 'em graphic novels.  Which is a fancy way of saying \"big thick trade paperback or hardcover comic books sold in bookstores instead of comic shops,\" really.  When I was a kid we called them \"funny books,\" but I don't think anyone but me and Howard Waldrop still remembers that.  Never mind.  I ramble.\r\n\r\nThe point is, I have all sorts of cool news on the funny book/ comic book/ graphic novel front.  Which I am not going to spill here all at once, because, well, it's more fun to torment you guys with one announcement at the time.  \r\n\r\nHere's the first: MEATHOUSE MAN, the graphic novel.\r\n\r\nThose of you who know me only from A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE may be wondering, what the hell is MEATHOUSE MAN??  The short answer is, \"one of my old SF short stories.\"  (Actually, a novelette).  \r\n\r\nThe long answer is, \"the darkest, bleakest, sickest, most twisted thing I ever wrote.\"  \r\n\r\nI wrote it back in the late 1970s, in response to an invitation from Harlan Ellison, who wanted something of mine for THE LAST DANGEROUS VISIONS.  Most of my own visions, back then, were more romantic and melancholy than dangerous, but I wanted in that book, so I took up the challenge, opened a vein, and with my very own blood (no, not really) wrote this disturbing tale of zombie necrophilia, and... well, it was a painful story to write, and painful to read as well.  When I sent it to Harlan, he rejected it... but Damon Knight bought it, and it was published in ORBIT 18.  I've reprinted it a few times since.  I really cannot say I \"like\" the story (it is not the sort of story that lends itself to liking), but it is a powerful piece.  \r\n\r\nAnd now it is going to be a funny book... er... graphic novel.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/166030/166030_300.jpg\" alt=\"mhmcov_Web\" title=\"mhmcov_Web\" width=\"210\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\nFor that, blame must go to Raya Golden, my talented (and somewhat twisted) Second Minion, a terrific young artist.  Raya wanted to adapt something of mine as a comic, so when I offered her the choice of all the stuff in DREAMSONGS not already under option, she surprised the seven hells out of me by choosing \"Meathouse Man.\"  (And she seems so sane and happy).  Then she took the ball and ran with it.\r\n\r\nRaya broke down the story, adapted it to comic form, wrote the script, did the pencils, the inks, the coloring, the covers.  This is her MEATHOUSE MAN as much as it is mine.  \r\n\r\nAmazon's publishing arm 47 North will be bringing it out in October... as an e-book for Kindle for sure.  Raya and the gang at Amazon have done some interesting and innovative stuff to marry the medium to the format; this whole e-comic thing is a brave new world.  (E-funny books?  Who woulda thunk it?)  A print edition is also possible, but not definite, waiting on final word on that.\r\n\r\nSo that's the first of my funny books making its way toward you.  Raya's done an an amazing job on it, I think... I hope you'll check it out, and... well, \"enjoy\" may not be the word, the story is kind of a punch in the gut, but...\r\n\r\nThat's MEATHOUSE MAN.  Coming this October to a Kindle near you.","ditemid":322366,"eventtime":"2013-05-08 18:37:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"graphic novels, science fiction, zombies, comic books","current_moodid":134,"commentalter":1368401939,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":4,"revtime":1369866827},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-04-30 00:38:01","anum":62,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html","event_timestamp":1368038220,"reply_count":44,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121936034/32959990","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17666366#t17666366","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17666366#t17666366","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17666366#t17666366","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"robospawn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://robospawn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17666366,"talkid":69009,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17666366#t17666366","upictitle":"robospawn: pic#121936034","article":"Last night's Game of Thrones was stellar.

There is nothing like the feel and smell of a \"funny book\", new or old. My first graphic novel was the first Superman annual which cost 50 cents, a small fortune at the time (1950's).

Definitely a well written piece.  Personally, as much as I love fantasy, my true love is horror.  Especially well written short horror stories such as MEAT MAN.  <br /><br />I find it interesting that you frequently feature stories in your anthologies that you edit by Joe Lansdale who is considered one of the masters of extreme horror.  NIGHT THEY MISSED THE HORROR SHOW is one of the most disturbing examples of extreme horror that I've ever read.  In reading the story, you get the impression that Joe had a lot of fun writing it, as twisted as it sounds.  That's a testament to Joe's skills as a writer. He wrote another story called INCIDENT ON AND OFF A MOUNTAIN ROAD that was pretty cool. <br /><br />Edward Lee is another prolific author in the Splatterpunk vein.  While I find him intriguing, he frequently bludgeons readers with so much sex and violence that you eventually become numb to it.  THE BIGHEAD is a perfect example.  Way too over the top.  <br /><br />Richard Christian Matheson, son of the great Richard Matheson, also is renowned in the Splatterpunk movement.  His short story RED is only two pages long but definitely hits you like a punch to the stomach.<br /><br />Of course the greatest writer considered part of the Splatterpunk genre would have to be Clive Barker.  While some of his work could be considered extreme, his creativity and fantastic imagination could almost be considered Lovecraftian in that he created entire worlds and myths that are horrible and stunning at the same time (see THE HELLBOUND HEART (what the HELLRAISER movies were based upon) as well as WEAVEWORLD).<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 30 2013, 20:47:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://montydelrogue.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"montydelrogue","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"montydelrogue","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://montydelrogue.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"montydelrogue","ctime_ts":1367354830,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17678398#t17678398","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17678398#t17678398","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17678398#t17678398","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17678398#t17678398","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17678398,"talkid":69056,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17678398#t17678398","above":17676094,"upictitle":"George R.R.

There is nothing comical in (almost) any of them. The whole genre is monopolized by picture format stories of violent (not even slapstick and quite often gory) adventures of skimpily dressed bulging-muscled super-heroes (gender neutral). In that respect 'graphic novel' is a much more appropriate name. One can call it 'cartoon book' (simply 'cartoon' being reserved for cartoon movie/strips).<br /><br />European comics are still true to the nature/genre ... I have seen a bunch of recent French and German comics that have pun, humour and other comical aspects. Even their adventure graphic stories are much better than their US counterparts ... in terms of drawing style and more importantly, content wise ... much more historical or fantasy based rather than one-dimensional super-hero stories.<br /><br />Speaking of 'comic' and good book, I would promote 'Cartoon History of the Universe' all the volumes ... an exceptionally entertaining ans immensely edifying work. Anyone who likes comic books and EVERYONE who likes history (of the human race as a whole) should read/buy it.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"May 1 2013, 07:45:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"on comic book and graphic novels","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/amaresh.datta.1","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Amaresh Datta","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1454011","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=53507163&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Amaresh Datta","ctime_ts":1367394337,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17683518#t17683518","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17683518#t17683518","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17683518#t17683518","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"attilathepbnun","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://attilathepbnun.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17683518,"talkid":69076,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html?thread=17683518#t17683518","upictitle":"attilathepbnun: pic#0","article":"I remember them being called funny books!<br />Well, actually, I remember other (older)people calling them funny books ...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"May 2 2013, 02:10:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://attilathepbnun.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"attilathepbnun","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"attilathepbnun","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://attilathepbnun.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"attilathepbnun","ctime_ts":1367460658,"tracked":0}]}
