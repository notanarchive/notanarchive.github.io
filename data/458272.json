{"itemid":1790,"subject":"Awards Season","event":"Awards season is upon us.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Globe nominations have just been announced.  And once again GAME OF THRONES is a finalist in Best Television Series - Drama.  Congrats to David Benioff, Dan Weiss, HBO, and our amazing cast and crew.  This year we are up against OUTLANDER, MR. ROBOT, NARCOS, and EMPIRE. \r\n\r\nWill we win?  Maybe.  We've been nominated before, but never won -- but that was true of the Emmy Awards as well, until this year, so maybe this time will prove to be the charm in the Globes as well.  Actually, none of the nominees in this category have ever won, so someone is going to be taking home a Globe for the first time.  I'm glad to see OUTLANDER getting some recognition, after being snubbed by the Emmys; it's a superb show.  Never watched the other three, so it's hard to say how they stack up.  \r\n\r\nSad to say, none of our actors were nominated.  Boo, hiss.  Lena Headey deserved a nod for sure, and some of our other regulars as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/317448/317448_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nFor a full list of those who were, go to:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/golden-globe-nominations-complete-list-847494\r\n\r\nOUTLANDER did very well with noms for Tobias Menzies in Supporting Actor and Catrionia Balfe in Lead Actress, both well deserved... but the Hollywood Foreign Press should really have made it three by nominating Sam Heughan too.  He was amazing as Jamie Frazier.  \r\n\r\nThe film nominations were a mixed bag, in my opinion.  Very pleased to see MAD MAX:FURY ROAD up for Best Drama, and Bryan Cranston nominated for his performance as Dalton Trumbo in TRUMBO... a superb film that deserves a lot more attention than it's getting.  \r\n\r\nAlso pleased to see the nominations for THE MARTIAN... but wait... THE MARTIAN is up <b><i>for Best Comedy or Musical??????  </i></b>Was that for Mark Watney's toe-tapping rendition of \"Get Me Home Before I Starve To Death?\"  Or maybe that ever popular musical number, \"Growing Potatoes in Poop, Heigh Ho?\"  I mean, c'mon guys, a nomination is a nomination, but... \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on other fronts, the Writers Guild of America also announced their screenwriting nominations.  GAME OF THRONES is up twice.  David Benioff and Dan Weiss and Bryan Cogman and Dave Hill are up collectively as a writing staff, up against the writing staffs of MR. ROBOT, MAD MEN, BETTER CALL SAUL, and THE AMERICANS.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/317230/317230_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nDavid and Dan are also nominated for best single episode for \"Mother's Mercy,\" competing with episodes of NARCOS, THE LEFTOVERS, THE GOOD WIFE, MAD MEN, and BETTER CALL SAUL.  For a complete list of finalists, go to:\r\n\r\nhttp://awards.wga.org/wga-awards/nominees-winners\r\n\r\nFinally, we also have acting nominations from the Screen Actors Guild, which can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://variety.com/2015/film/awards/sag-award-nominations-2016-nominees-full-list-1201657169/\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/317822/317822_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/317996/317996_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nSAG gave GOT three nods:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama, Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble... and Peter Dinklage for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama.\r\n\r\nMy congratulations to everyone who was nominated.  You deserved it!  And my condolences to all those who were not.

No other way to put it! The former did an absolutely incredible job in \"Outlander\" (especially at the end of the season) and deserves recognition for that amazing performance. As the for the latter, well, it's Tatiana Freakin' Maslany. That's pretty much all that needs to be said at this stage! \"Orphan Black\" itself should be nominated at least once too.<br /><br />It's really great to see Gina Rodriguez nominated again. Her work on \"Jane the Virgin\" is definitely praise worthy. Not a show I ever thought I'd like let alone love. But the cast is outstanding and the writing is surprisingly sharp and funny. The show knows exactly what it is (a telenovela that's a spoof of telenovelas without ever being disrespectful) and is fully committed to being one of the most convoluted, amusing stories on TV. As much as I love dark stories, sometimes it can be a bit much. This one is mostly lightweight and positive. Balances out the many dark shows that I'm watching!<br /><br />I'm a bit surprised that \"Master of None\" didn't get nominated. At least Aziz Ansari was, though. The show caught me a bit off guard. I was just expecting a comedy with the usual morally bankrupt characters that are popular these days and instead it delivered a show that's part comedy, part drama, and part essay with a main character that's ultimately a good person.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 12 2015, 17:38:59 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/clonedllama","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"clonedllama","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2573139","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70685480&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 12 2015, 17:41:44 UTC","dname":"clonedllama","ctime_ts":1449941939,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123721201/71653468","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458272.html?thread=23242784#t23242784","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458272.html?thread=23242784#t23242784","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458272.html?thread=23242784#t23242784","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"iroberts007","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://iroberts007.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23242784,"talkid":90792,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458272.html?thread=23242784#t23242784","above":23240992,"upictitle":"iroberts007: pic#123721201","article":"Maslany is an incredible actress (maybe one of the best I've ever seen) and Orphan Black was great but I think it jumped the shark a while back.

Personally I'd really like that. It's not that I have a problem with the current writing crew. On the contrary, I think the writing on the show is spectacular, and I'm a huge fan of both David and Dan. But It's still your story after all, and I'd still like it very much if you'll write an episode for the show every now and then, and you'll have a big active part in it. I know you are always behind the curtains and with endless discussions with David and Dan, but writing an actual episode is much more... intimate. Also, I understand you must be very busy with writing The Winds of Winter, but is there still hope we might see another GRRM episode on HBO?<br /><br />By the way, I'm a huge fan.
