I had heard about this show a while ago and thought it sounded somewhat intriguing. Seeing the trailer has made this show a \"must see\" for me once it starts up.<br /><br />I admit that I have been a bit soured on Syfy ever since they canceled Farscape* and treated Stargate Atlantis like a second class citizen. They did have the reimagined BSG, though. So that counts for a lot. Still, it's nice to see them finally getting back into having more actual science fiction shows. And not only that, one that takes place in space. More sci-fi, less wrestling and ghost hunting please!<br /><br />* Yes, I know that's a long time to hold a grudge over something like this but I'm still annoyed with Fox for canceling Firefly, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and Dollhouse (even if there were clear financial reasons for why all of those decisions were made).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 17 2015, 00:26:16 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/clonedllama","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"clonedllama","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2573139","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70685480&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"clonedllama","ctime_ts":1421454376,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402786.html?replyto=20120418","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402786.html?thread=20120418#t20120418","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402786.html?thread=20120418#t20120418","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402786.html?thread=20120418#t20120418","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2967747","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/110040390191648791759","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20120418,"talkid":78595,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402786.html?thread=20120418#t20120418","upictitle":"Tessa Vaako: pic#0","article":"Well that was annoying.
