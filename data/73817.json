{"itemid":288,"subject":"For Your Hugo Consideration: Me","event":"And before I close out the Hugo discussion (at least from my end), I would be remiss if I did not mention that I am eligible myself in a couple of categories this year.\r\n\r\nBoth of new Wild Cards books were published last year, INSIDE STRAIGHT in January and BUSTED FLUSH in December.  They're mosaic novels, but of course that's not a Hugo category.  And there is no \"anthology\" category.  But, as editor, I would be eligible in\r\n \r\n            Best Editor: Short Form\r\n\r\nThe editorial Hugo was split in two a couple of years ago, and Short Form has become the magazine category, where all of the magazine editors contend, with sometimes an anthology editor sneaking in to round out the shortlist.  \r\n\r\nI also published a story in INSIDE STRAIGHT -- my Lohengrin story, \"Crusader.\"  If you liked it, that one would be eligible in\r\n\r\n            Best Novelette\r\n\r\nAnd that's all I have to say about this year's Hugos.\r\n\r\nFor now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002kaz3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002kaz3/s320x240\" width=\"80\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nBut whether or not you choose to nominate me, or any of my recommendations below, please do remember to nominate.  The Hugo is your award, the reader's award, but it's meaningless without your participation.\r\n\r\nRemember, you only have until February 28.","ditemid":73817,"eventtime":"2009-02-19 16:13:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":205,"taglist":"hugo awards, fandom","current_moodid":43,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1235410143},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-02-19 23:23:05","anum":89,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html","event_timestamp":1235059980,"reply_count":3,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/71940833/14280702","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?replyto=5325657","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5325657#t5325657","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5325657#t5325657","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5325657#t5325657","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"scottedelman","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://scottedelman.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5325657,"talkid":20803,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5325657#t5325657","upictitle":"scottedelman: Tokyo","article":"Hmmm ... if the Best Novel Hugo is the Big One and the Best Short Story Hugo is the Little One, then what One is the Best Editor Hugo?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 20 2009, 00:06:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://scottedelman.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"scottedelman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"scottedelman","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://scottedelman.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"scottedelman","ctime_ts":1235088387,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/85553320/2114520","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?replyto=5416281","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5416281#t5416281","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5416281#t5416281","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5416281#t5416281","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"slojae","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://slojae.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5416281,"talkid":21157,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5416281#t5416281","upictitle":"James Cheney: pic#85553320","article":"what's a hugo?<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 20 2009, 11:16:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://slojae.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"slojae","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"slojae","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://slojae.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"slojae","ctime_ts":1235128562,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?replyto=5522265","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5522265#t5522265","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5522265#t5522265","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5522265#t5522265","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wabus44","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wabus44.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5522265,"talkid":21571,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/73817.html?thread=5522265#t5522265","upictitle":"wabus44: pic#71622456","article":"ummm...I think the award for best football prognosticator commenting on this blog should receive an award as well.
