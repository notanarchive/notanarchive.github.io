{"itemid":1736,"subject":"A Win for Big Blue","event":"The Giants won their first game of the season last night.\r\n\r\nAbout time, I say.  At this point they should actually be 3-0, since they went into the fourth quarter of the Dallas and Atlanta game with double-digit leads, only to blow both contests.  Last night, thankfully, they hung on and won convincingly.\r\n\r\nBut I am not reading that much into this.  It was a win, yes, but a home win over Washington, and the G-Men have owned the Redskins in recent years.  Eli looked good last night, and Odell Beckham Junior continues to look great.  Reuben Randal came up big as well, thank ghod.  But I still have questions about the defense.  In the fourth quarter, they had not one but two chances to end the game by stopping Washington on fourth-and-long, but gave up first downs both times.  And the pass rush is just not there.  Will JPP ever return?  If he does, will he be the player he was, minus a finger and half his thumb?  Who knows?  But boy, the G-Men need him.\r\n\r\nVictor Cruz will return next week, they say.  That will be great, and should lift the offense to the next level.  But how Spags gets the D to the next level, I don't know.\r\n\r\nEven at 1-2, the opportunity is there for the Giants, with the Eagles reeling and the Cowboys suffering devastating injuries to Dez and Romo.  Whether they will be good enough to take advantage of the chance remains to be seen.  There are sterner tests a-coming.","ditemid":444496,"eventtime":"2015-09-25 13:54:00","props":{"current_mood":"cynical","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":104,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1443330021,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"A Win for Big Blue http://goo.gl/P24jdh","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.73796783956136]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1443210888}","revtime":1443722588},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-09-25 19:54:32","anum":80,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444496.html","event_timestamp":1443189240,"reply_count":32,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121411156/65344279","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444496.html?thread=22688336#t22688336","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444496.html?thread=22688336#t22688336","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444496.html?thread=22688336#t22688336","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2058420","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22688336,"talkid":88626,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444496.html?thread=22688336#t22688336","upictitle":"GeekFurious: pic#121411156","article":"Obviously Giants should be 3-0.

Throw in William Beatty's return to the offensive line in October or November and I think this offense will have enough parts to succeed (although I wouldn't mind an upgrade at TE as Larry Donnell is way too inconsistent).<br /><br />What they need is ammo for the D-line, another safety, and a third cornerback.  We don't know what if anything we'll ever get from JPP, meaning Hankins is the only long-term building block on the D-line we can depend on. Ayers is a nice role player, but that's about it. I don't think Damontre Moore is going to develop into anything more than a situational pass rusher.  He has a huge opportunity this year and he's done nothing with it.  Maybe that rookie Oza will develop on the line, but first we need to see him play.  Landon Collins seems to have some promise at safey, but Merriweather is just a stopgap for the year.  I also wouldn't mind the Giants improving the linebacking corps, but Reese never puts a premium on this group.<br /><br />Still, if the Giants can kick the injury bug, I think they are one good draft and free agency period away from improving the defense enough to become a very dangerous team.
