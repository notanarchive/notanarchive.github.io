But since A Song of Ice and Fire was also originally intended to be a much shorter work, is it possible that what you think will just be another short story could end up as a whole novel instead?<br /> <br />And about religions; when introduced to the world is Westeros, doesn't it all take place in a post-magic world, where all the miracles belongs to the past and people like Tyrion believes it's all fairytales and superstition (I suppose the long summers and winters are not considered magic but simply accepted as part of nature). Then the white walkers and dragons returns, and magic is \"brought back into the world\".<br /><br />If people in the past followed those who could perform miracles, is it their absence the last centuries that has caused the rise of the \"new gods\" and new religions? And could the number of religions decrease in numbers now when magic has returned once more?<br /><br />And now when you have become a celebrity writer; has it ever happened that you have been chased by a horde of screaming female fans?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"August 2 2014, 07:06:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://profiles.google.com/112872450945678881297","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ext_1669084","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1669084","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=60850522&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"August 10 2014, 15:03:51 UTC","dname":"ext_1669084","ctime_ts":1406963170,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/89426865/11405769","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377702#t19377702","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377702#t19377702","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377702#t19377702","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"olunkaa","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://olunkaa.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19377702,"talkid":75694,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377702#t19377702","upictitle":"Oluna: wedding","article":"Thank you a lot!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"August 2 2014, 08:05:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://olunkaa.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"olunkaa","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"olunkaa","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://olunkaa.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"olunkaa","ctime_ts":1406966753,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123576700/71315710","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377958#t19377958","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377958#t19377958","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377958#t19377958","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2636329","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/arne.tmn","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19377958,"talkid":75695,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378918.html?thread=19377958#t19377958","upictitle":"Arne T-mann: pic#123576700","article":"Well, this one was the best interview so far.
