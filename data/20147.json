{"itemid":78,"subject":"The Joy of Football","event":"First the Jets, now the Giants.  Life is meaningless and has no purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Giants and Cowboys did put on a barnburner, at least.  I thought the G-Men were going to blow them out in the first quarter -- and they might have, if Amani Toomer had only gotten his toes down on Eli's second TD bomb.  Then at the end, I thought maybe they'd somehow pull it out with a miracle finish.  But it was not to be.  \r\n\r\nEverything in between is best forgotten.\r\n\r\nBest game I've seen from Plax.  Eli should just have thrown to him every play.  Derrick Ward showed some good stuff too, and Amani Toomer came back bigtime from last season's injury.  The Giants O-line held up better than expected, but their D-line generated absolutely no pressure.  Strahan decided not to retire, I know, but you couldn't tell it by his presence on the field today.  Where were the sacks?  \r\n\r\nI know most football fans love games like this, with all the scoring, but not me.  I like good defense.  I didn't see one on the field today.  Neither the Giants nor the Cowboys seems to have a defense.  Neither team could stop the other.  Both have lots of high-priced defensive stars, but that doesn't seem to translate to actual stops.\r\n\r\nThe Giants injuries are more worrisome than losing the game.  Eli Manning, Brandon Jacobs, Osi Umenyoira... that's our starting QB, starting RB, and best pass rusher.  Losing all three in the first game is no way to begin a season.\r\n\r\n(And all my best wishes are going out to that poor TE on the Bills)","ditemid":20147,"eventtime":"2007-09-09 23:14:00","props":{"commentalter":1189659620,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-09-10 05:25:39","anum":179,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html","event_timestamp":1189379640,"reply_count":54,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98198739/7319215","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?replyto=2411443","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2411443#t2411443","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2411443#t2411443","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2411443#t2411443","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2411443#t2411443","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"stegoking","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://stegoking.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2411443,"talkid":9419,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2411443#t2411443","article":"Rough game.<br /><br />I totally agree with you about the high scoring games.

His pass rushing was missed, though the rookie first round pick Anthony Spencer played fairly well. The real concern, though, is the loss of nose tackle Jason Ferguson to a possible season ending injury. There is really no depth behind him at tackle.<br /><br />On the positive side they didn't seem to miss Terry Glenn, who may miss a portion or the entire season. And so much for the notion that Tony Romo would have a hangover from the Seattle playoff debacle last season.

I hope that they will be able to start playing like they should be capable of.<br /><br />As for Everett, reports are they won't know for a few days whether he will be able to walk again.  Hopefully, he will pull through and come out of this healthy.  While Everett's injury was by far the worst, by the time all the games were finished, the NFL was littered with opening day injuries.<br /><br />As for the Giants, to have their new top running back, their top sack leader and their quarterback to not make it through their opening game, makes me wonder what type of season this will end up being.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"September 10 2007, 16:15:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Where&#39;s the defense?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cedunkley.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cedunkley","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cedunkley","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cedunkley.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cedunkley","ctime_ts":1189440934,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/87437535/1578749","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?replyto=2419123","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2419123#t2419123","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2419123#t2419123","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2419123#t2419123","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wmslawhorn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wmslawhorn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2419123,"talkid":9449,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20147.html?thread=2419123#t2419123","upictitle":"wmslawhorn: dodo","article":"I have to admit I hope the Giants second game isn't too good either.  I have to believe that Thomas Jones will get better as the season progresses.  The NE Defense is a tough first test.  LT only had a few rushing yards, yes a passing td and 50 receiving yds, but Michale turner hasd more rushing yds at 41 than LT.  Larry Johnson had a pitiful game against Houston.
