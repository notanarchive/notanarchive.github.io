However, on re-reads, one realises his ramblings seem almost prophetic. I paid particular note to Mel’s comment about him in Dance too (which I won’t repeat for fear of spoiling).<br /><br />I cannot believe you have created this character as a mere throwaway. You must have big plans for him (even though he isn’t in the show)? Please, for my sanity, let me know.

A copy of my book, my most loved book, she is beautiful and worn and warm when I hold her, her pages soft and flowing, the words familiar and close, loved & treasured.  <br /><br />My heart skipped as I pressed PayPal (for international orders), and froze as I awaited the page to load, only to my horror and deep sorrow to receive: \"We're sorry, the following item(s) isn't available at this time:\"<br /><br />Fevre Dream is no longer in stock. My dear Abner, my companion Joshua, the 2 men in my life that have traveled with me through thick and thin, never leaving my side even in my darkest hours, was unavailable to purchase.<br /><br />Thank you for putting one of the most beloved books in my collection up on sale, it's a shame that I missed it.  I hope you will do another release.<br /><br />Merry Christmas & Happy New Year.<br />X","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 19 2014, 06:25:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Thank you","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Mistress.LoveBrice","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Karen Love-Brice","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2928415","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73616814&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 19 2014, 06:27:05 UTC","dname":"Karen Love-Brice","ctime_ts":1418970327,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396143.html?thread=19948911#t19948911","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396143.html?thread=19948911#t19948911","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396143.html?thread=19948911#t19948911","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19948911,"talkid":77925,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/396143.html?thread=19948911#t19948911","above":19929711,"upictitle":"George R.R.
