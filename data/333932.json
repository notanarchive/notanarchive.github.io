{"itemid":1304,"subject":"Finland, Finland, Finland","event":"In the comments section to the post immediately below, someone asked about voting for this year&#39;s Hugo Awards.&nbsp; Alas, Hugo voting closed some time ago... for the 2013 awards, at least.\r\n\r\nYou can still cast your vote at LoneStarCon, however... not for the Hugo Awards, but for site selection.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s the fans who nominate and vote for the Hugos, and the fans who decide where the world science fiction convention will be held. Unlike Dragoncon (always in Atlanta), Comicon (always in San Diego), or other megacons of their ilk, worldcon moves to a different city every year, just as it has since its founding in the 1930s.&nbsp; Cities wishing to host worldcon must put together a concom, find a suitable site and hotels, and bid for the rights to hold the con.&nbsp; Bidding, like American presidential elections, sometimes seems to go on forever, but the actual site selection ballot takes place two years in advance.\r\n\r\nAt this year&#39;s San Antonio worldcon, LoneStarCon 3, fans will decide where the worldcon goes for 2015.\r\n\r\n(The site of the 2014 worldcon was determined at Chicon 7, last year&#39;s worldcon.&nbsp; The winner was London, England).\r\n\r\nThere are three contenders for 2015: Spokane, Washington; Orlando, Florida; and Helsinki, Finland.&nbsp; All three will be campaigning vigorously and throwing parties at Texas, I&#39;m sure, selling pre-supporting memberships, and bending the ears of everyone who cares to hear about their wonderful cities, amazing facilities, and experienced committees.&nbsp; So who to choose?\r\n\r\nAs it happens, I&#39;ve been to all three cities.&nbsp; Back in the mid 90s, I was GOH at a small regional con in Spokane.&nbsp; Nice fans.&nbsp; The city has its charms, and the surrounding countryside was lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s a small city, though, and it was a small friendly low-key con, which makes me wonder if the committee is ready to tackle something as large and contentious and complex as worldcon.\r\n\r\nOrlando hosted the worldcon once before -- MagiCon in 1992 -- and was supposed to be the site once even earlier -- SunCon in 1977.&nbsp; But SunCon was a disaster, had to move to Miami Beach after the fans voted for Orlando, and still ranks as one of the worst worldcons ever.&nbsp; MagiCon was much better... but hot, swelteringly hot.&nbsp; I have fond memories of the Peabody Hotel, but the new Orlando bid isn&#39;t using the Peabody, instead they will actually be inside Disney World, using Disney facilities.&nbsp; I like visiting Disney parks from time to time, and I love attending worldcon, but that does not mean I want to mix the two.&nbsp; The Orlando convention set-up has some undeniable advantages... I love the idea of having all of worldcon under a single roof, without elevators... but if you&#39;ve ever been to Disney World or Disneyland, you probably know that there will be drawbacks as well.&nbsp; Under the Mouse&#39;s roof, the Mouse&#39;s rules apply.&nbsp; And what with global warming and all, Orlando in 2015 will probably be even hotter than Orlando in 1992.&nbsp; Just thinking about it makes me want to turn the air conditioner up to &quot;ARCTIC BLAST.&quot;\r\n\r\nFortunately, I think there&#39;s one choice for 2015 that stands head and shoulders above the other two:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"362\" />\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, NOT England.&nbsp; England is next year.&nbsp; I&#39;m talking FINLAND!&nbsp; Helsinki!\r\n\r\nSinging, dancing, fish-slapping, reindeer, lingonberries...\r\n\r\nWell, no, not really.&nbsp; But Parris and I were guests at Finncon just a few years ago, and we had a great time.&nbsp; Helsinki is a great, lively, historic city, and the Finnish fans are terrific... warm and friendly and hospitable.&nbsp; They all speak English, by the way.&nbsp; Every Finn we met spoke English.&nbsp; So no one need worry about getting lost in a country where you cannot understand the language.&nbsp; You can eat reindeer and lingonberries if you have a yen... but there&#39;s plenty of other types of food for those who&#39;d rather not.&nbsp; Saunas are omnipresent... but not compulsory, if you are the shy sort who would rather not take off your clothes around other people.&nbsp; Helsinki&#39;s not quite north enough for a midnight sun, but we got a ten-oclock-at-night sun, and that was pretty cool too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell, you could even find good pizza.&nbsp; (I prefer never to go anywhere where you cannot find good pizza).\r\n\r\nEven more than the charms of the city, however, it was the competence and experience of the committee that impressed me.&nbsp; We have had too many badly-run worldcons in recent years (need I mention Montreal, anyone?).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finncon we attended was huge, drawing something like 30,000 people to Helsinki as I recall.&nbsp; That&#39;s six times as large as any worldcon since the 80s, yet the con ran smoothly start to finish, and everyone seemed to have a great time.&nbsp; I have no doubt that a Helsinki worldcon would be well run as well... and I know the Finnish fans would love to show your their city, their castles, the herds of reindeer wandering the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, there&#39;s vodka too.&nbsp; And saunas.&nbsp; Did I mention the saunas?\r\n\r\nBut seriously... if you&#39;d like to know more about the Finnish bid, check out their website here:&nbsp; http://www.helsinkiin2015.org/\r\n\r\nAnyway, those of you who will be attending LoneSTarCon should be sure to visit the site selection booths, check out the literature for the competing bid, then sign up for 2015 and cast your ballot.\r\n\r\nMe, I&#39;ll be voting for Helsinki... to put the &quot;world&quot; back in worldcon. \r\n\r\n(And for KANSAS CITY IN 2016 as well, but that vote is next year, in London).\r\n\r\nPOST LONESTARCON ADDENDUM\r\n\r\nAlas, Helsinki did not win the rights to host the 2015 worldcon.&nbsp; The Finns threw the best parties and had the most first place votes, but after leading on all the early ballots, they lost out in the end when Orlando was finally eliminated, and their votes swung en masse to Spokane.&nbsp; The vagaries of the Australian ballot. \r\n\r\nThe Finns will rise again, I hope.&nbsp; But it&#39;s Spokane in 2015.\r\n\r\n(Future bids announced or rumored at the con included New Orleans, Washington DC, and Dublin.&nbsp; I like the sound of all of those.","ditemid":333932,"eventtime":"2013-08-18 17:48:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"worldcon","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1378944986,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"denvention","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":6,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1378324006},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-08-18 23:48:23","anum":108,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html","event_timestamp":1376848080,"reply_count":78,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121665260/65925132","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18130540#t18130540","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18130540#t18130540","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18130540#t18130540","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18130540#t18130540","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2119687","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/bob.jenson","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18130540,"talkid":70822,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18130540#t18130540","upictitle":"Bob Jenson: pic#121665260","article":"But...I live in Spokane.

Class photo","article":"\"You can eat reindeer and lingonberries if you have a yen\"  When did Finland adopt the Japanese currency? I'd think having a Euro would be more useful, although the amount of reindeer and lingonberries one would get for a single Euro would probably be hardly enough for a snack. : -)<br /><br />More seriously, I have problems with all the sites. I think it was a long-term mistake to have 2000-2006 Worldcons all be in large non-isolated cities with large fanbases...followed by the 2007-2011 Worldcons all being in some combination of non-US, isolated, smallish cities. If Worldcon doesn't periodically appear in the sort of cities in 2000-2006, I think folk get out of the habit of attending. Note that Chicago was 20% lower in 2012 than in 2000. So while I sympathize with the Northwest wanting their first Worldcon since 1961, the hotel problems with Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver that make the SMOFs there bid for Reno and Spokane are a problem. And I don't think having as small and isolated a site as Reno and Spokane within 4 years is a good idea overall.<br /><br />Same for 2 years in a row in Europe. If Helsinki was bidding for 2017, I'd be all in favor. But I think Japan-Denver-Montreal-Australia was long term a bad ordering for the reasons given above. So by rights, I should be in favor of Orlando which'd be only the second Worldcon in the Eastern Time Zone since 2004, Montreal being the other and having had its own problems (didn't break 4K despite having Neil Gaiman as a GoH). But I have qualms about some of their upper committee. Damned if I know who I'll end up voting for.<br /><br />(Yes, I know it's a matter of who bids in a particular year, particularly since the 3-zone rotating location system was abolished, and there's nothing anyone could do to enforce a different order from 2000-2011. I still think the effects of 6 big non-isolated cities in a row followed by 5, well, not such, were detrimental long term)<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"August 19 2013, 02:43:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://querldox.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"querldox","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"querldox","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://querldox.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"querldox","ctime_ts":1376880229,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18132844#t18132844","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18132844#t18132844","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18132844#t18132844","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18132844#t18132844","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18132844,"talkid":70831,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18132844#t18132844","above":18132076,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Myself, I'd like to see it growing again.  It saddens me that our record attendance, 8000, was twenty years ago.  I don't want to see worldcon turn into San Diego Comicon with 150,000 fans, no, but a worldcon of 15,000 to 20,000 people would be good for everyone.  We would actually fill the big convention centers we use, instead of having to share them with four other conventions (as at Denver), we'd have more clout with hotels, it would certainly be good for the writers and publishers.  And we'd get a younger and more racially and sexually diverse crowd.<br /><br />This seems to be a minority view, however.  Certainly among the SMOFs I know, most of whom seem to like worldcon as it is, and don't want it getting any bigger.  And since almost all worldcons turn a profit in the end (Japan and Baltimore excepted), these problems caused by small cities, foreign sites, and the like are not problems at all.<br

In '95 At Glasgow there wasn't even whimsical talk of going to LAcon the next year, it was so beyond our reach. I think/hope that fans would get the bug after two consecutive Worldcons and consider the long trip to the US worth it. It also allows European conrunners to build experience and for European fans to become regular volunteers. <br /><br />Helsinki is some distance from London and so distinctly different yet achievable as a destination. I hope they win because I want to see people at London really captured by the idea of going to another Worldcon and I like the thought of growing Worldcons, where they can.

We do not attend more WorldCons for the simple reason it is scheduled opposite DragonCon (and I know D-Con is an Edward IV usurper type).  Still it seems an odd thing to not work out.  We prefer non-US locations simply because they don't tend to conflict with D-con.<br /><br />(Other reasons to support the Yorkist Con:  despite Mr. Martin being at WorldCon, D-con often has more Ice and Fire oriented events including a mass out pouring of fans in the parade.  Also it has more gaming including my I&F oriented miniature games - a personal favorite).<br /><br />Making Lemondade out of Lemons<br /><br />The schedule conflict is unfortunate but at risk of a beheading, I'll give my reasons for moving WorldCon:<br /><br />1)  The Hugos.  These are awarded VERY late in the award season.  Academy awards go out in March - not September.  The winners can seem a bit like old news as a new Summer movie season has passed etc.  I think the H's would get more/better pub if they were a bit closer to year end (say Memorial Day?)<br /><br />2)  D-con is big and immobile when faced with a large \"opponent\" use maneuver not head butting<br /><br />3)  Strength in numbers.  Why split efforts in a genre trying to establish itself as a cultural heavy weight.  At Dragon Con the spirit is \"nerds\" rule (the whole city turns out to cheer the parade - it feels like marching in the Rose Parade).  Worldcon seemed a bit more reserved and self-concious esp re costuming and other forms of irrational exhurbrance.  Oldtimers (like me) did not seem to realize that we had won the culture wars.  What do those guys that picked on you in high school call you now?  Boss.  <br /><br /><br />For now I plan to just be a supporting member so I can vote on the Hugos but I would much prefer to be a year in year out attender...<br /><br />TomT","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"August 19 2013, 20:58:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Where to Worldcon","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://starkdad.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"starkdad","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"starkdad","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://starkdad.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"starkdad","ctime_ts":1376945938,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18143084#t18143084","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18143084#t18143084","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18143084#t18143084","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18143084#t18143084","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18143084,"talkid":70871,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/333932.html?thread=18143084#t18143084","above":18142060,"upictitle":"George R.R.
