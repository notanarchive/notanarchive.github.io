Talked about new book, MARTIANS ABROAD, about Old Mars and New Mars and Podkayne and Heinlein, about her bestselling Kitty Norville series, about her contributions to Wild Cards.\r\n\r\nIf you missed it, have no fear.  We taped it, and plan to upload a streaming video soon.\r\n\r\nBefore she left, of course, we made her sign lots and lots of books for us, so if you're looking for an autographed copy of MARTIANS ABROAD or any of her earlier books, or a hardcover of INSIDE STRAIGHT signed by both Carrie and yours truly, you need look no further than the JCC bookshop.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/412137/412137_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/412182/412182_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/412628/412628_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/412778/412778_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/413025/413025_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/413323/413323_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nCheck out these and other signed books at http://jeancocteaucinema.com/product-category/author/","ditemid":519019,"eventtime":"2017-01-29 16:53:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, jean cocteau cinema, signings, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Jan 29 23:53:34 2017]R [Sun Jan 29 23:53:35 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/825854434328604672 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1488733341,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/825854434328604672","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.645299624072436]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1485734073}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2027?v=1485902455","revtime":1485902454},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-29 23:53:33","anum":107,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519019.html","event_timestamp":1485708780,"reply_count":9,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519019.html?thread=25681515#t25681515","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519019.html?thread=25681515#t25681515","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519019.html?thread=25681515#t25681515","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ncohen2","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ncohen2.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25681515,"talkid":100318,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519019.html?thread=25681515#t25681515","upictitle":"Noah Cohen: pic#0","article":"I'm going to go broke.
