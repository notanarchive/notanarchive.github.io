{"itemid":865,"subject":"In Warsaw","event":"I'm in Warsaw.  Spent the morning doing interviews and a big press conference.  Now I'm about to leave for a signing at the Traffic Club, whioh is actually a bookstore.\r\n\r\nGetting here was somewhat of an ordeal.  Our flight from Abluquerque to Chicago was an hour late, which resulted in us missing our connection, and the direct flight that would have gotten us into Poland yesetdray morning.  Instead we had to cool our heels half a day in O'Hare and then go by way of London, with a change of planes in Heathrow.  We got into Warsaw yesetrday evening instead, and had to go straight to a big HBO interview at a movie complex.  There were several hundred fans there, an amazing turnout.  Alas, I was too exhausted to sign books and had to go get some sleep... but I am about to make up for that at the Traffic Club.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm fine (if tired) and glad to be here.  (But my assistant Ty is sick as a dog.  We're hoping he'll be better by tomorrow, when we leave Warsaw for the con in Ndiza).","ditemid":221558,"eventtime":"2011-06-15 16:56:00","props":{"taglist":"travels","current_moodid":14,"commentalter":1308518564,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1308544103},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-06-15 14:56:41","anum":118,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html","event_timestamp":1308156960,"reply_count":67,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/39229860/1463629","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820278#t13820278","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820278#t13820278","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820278#t13820278","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"svetosila","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://svetosila.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13820278,"talkid":53985,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820278#t13820278","upictitle":"Svetosila: maja","article":"Have a nice time. <br />It strikes me you came here via London, so you've sort of repeated the route of Polish fighters during the Second World war, some of them were parachuted from the airplanes and landed in the terrotory occupied by Nazies, so your journey was rather less interesting and tiring compared to those. <br /><br />And while I'm here let me say your books have many fans in Russia (and now the series is watched by many people too)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 15 2011, 15:04:20 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://svetosila.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"svetosila","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"svetosila","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://svetosila.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"svetosila","ctime_ts":1308150260,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110979979/38594272","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820534#t13820534","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820534#t13820534","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820534#t13820534","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_646389","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/Hinson.Miller","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13820534,"talkid":53986,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221558.html?thread=13820534#t13820534","upictitle":"Laura Hinson: pic#110979979","article":"Alas, the process of traveling these days is not easy nor pleasurable.
