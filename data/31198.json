{"itemid":121,"subject":"Some Odds, Some Ends, Some This, Some That","event":"Random musings and nuggets of news, oh my.\r\n\r\nI don't follow comics closely these days, but do buy an issue from time to time, and of course I do have still have huge affection for the characters of my lost youth.  So I was puzzled recently when one of my readers emailed me to ask what I thought about what Marvel had done to Spider-Man.  I didn't know what Marvel had done to Spider-Man, but I was curious enough to Google, and pretty soon I found out.  Bloody hell.  I hate this, and judging from the discussions I am seeing on various blogs, I am not alone.  Retconning sucks.  Leave the goddamned continuity ALONE, for chrissakes.  What happened, happened.  Take an old character in a new direction, fine, cool, but don't go back and mess around with the character's past.  It's a breach of trust with your audience, as I see it.  The DC universe has never really recovered from the Crisis on Infinite Earths, despite all the Crises that have followed, and I think the Marvel universe, and Spidey in particular, will be a long time recovering from this decision.  So that's my two cents.  In a nutshell: boo, hiss, shame on you, Marvel.  If I had a rotten tomato, I would throw it.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a promise you can write in blood.  The Wild Cards universe will never be retconned.  What happened happened, and will continue to have happened, no matter what might happen in the future.  \r\n\r\nOn other fronts, there's a nice new review of HUNTER'S RUN up at http://fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/hunters-run-by-george-r-r-martin.html\r\n\r\nThe political season is well underway.  I haven't made any political posts here as yet, but be warned, they will be coming.  That's one of the reasons I started this Not-A-Blog, you may recall.  So far, I haven't decided which Dem to support in this year's presidential contest.  I was leaning toward Bill Richardson, who has been a superb governor for New Mexico, but Bill is out of it now, so I guess I'll have to find a new candidate.  Obama and Edwards both interest me.  I am lukewarm about Hillary.  I wish she had come out stronger against the war.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this election, no matter who wins, is that come 2009, we will finally be rid of the worst president in all of American history, that malignant moron George W. Bush.\r\n\r\nThe new Wild Cards book, INSIDE STRAIGHT, will be out in less than two weeks.  The official pubdate is January 22.  Here's a shout-out for all of you New Mexicans, and for readers in surrounding states as well -- we'll be having a big launch party and signing for INSIDE STRAIGHT at Albuquerque's Page One Bookstore on Saturday, February 2, at 2:00 pm.  I will be on hand to autograph books, and so will Melinda Snodgrass, John Jos. Miller, Ian Tregillis, Daniel Abraham, Caroline Spector, Carrie Vaughn, and Michael Cassutt.  That's eight of the nine contributors to the book, and you can get your copy signed by all of us.  Only the elusive and enigmatic S.L. Farrell will be missing.  We understand that S.L. will be down in Brazil searching for his lost brother Matthew, who was last seen paddling up the Amazon in search of... oh, wait, I'm not supposed to talk about that.\r\n\r\nThose of you who can't make it to Albuquerque for the INSIDE STRAIGHT signing can still get autographed copies of the book by mail order.  Just give Page One a call, or order online through their website at http://www.page1book.com/   All of the attending authors (including me) will be pleased to sign copies of their other titles as well, but you will need to buy a copy of INSIDE STRAIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn Hollywood, the writer's strike goes on and on, but David Letterman's company has signed an independent deal with the WGA, as has United Artists, owned by Tom Cruise.  So let's have a round of applause for Letterman and Cruise.  And remember\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-v2zwKDggI\r\n\r\nSpeaking of YouTube, all four segments from the Wild Cards panel at the 1988 Worldcon in New Orleans are now up there, so if you'd like to know the secrets of the Bandersnatch and the Howler Revenge Squad, head on over to YouTube and search for Wild Cards.\r\n\r\nWho will be the new American Hero?","ditemid":31198,"eventtime":"2008-01-10 12:28:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":777,"commentalter":1352709437,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-01-10 20:03:51","anum":222,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html","event_timestamp":1199968080,"reply_count":258,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98491204/879577","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?replyto=3066846","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3066846#t3066846","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3066846#t3066846","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3066846#t3066846","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"goodtimenation","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://goodtimenation.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3066846,"talkid":11979,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3066846#t3066846","upictitle":"peace now, freedom now, equality now.: ai // she&#39;s a rebel.","article":"The Weinstein Company said they've reached a deal with the writer's, too.

Of all the candidates, I have to say Kucinich is the most in line with the things I believe are right, but he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of becoming president.  In the end, I'll wind up supporting pretty much any of the democratic candidates against any of these republicans running.<br /><br />I know how people get on your political posts, though.

In fact, let me state for the record that this will not be the last one Marvel has lined up. There is a Captain America movie in the works (I think IMDb) has it slated for 2009) and when that comes out you watch, Steve Rogers will be back in the costume. I'm willing to place money on it. Every time Marvel does something big - removing Wolverine's adamantium, changing Spidey's costume/identity, killing off any character - they get reamed for it. Then they drag it on too long, then they have a really, really cheesy storyline to fix what they should never have done in the first place. DC does it too I will admit, but thankfully I stopped reading even Batman (my all time favorite comic) some years ago. Now I just pine for the old days when someone tells me that Hal Jordan is back from the dead. Or that Spidey made a deal with the Devil. Or that somehow Bucky Barnes is alive and well.

But it seems none of them could countenance ending it by, say, killing MJ or working out some means to get the pair divorced in a way that would (allegedly) stick.<br /><br />As is, you've got the worst of both worlds. The contortions over whether it'sa retcon or not is just _ridiculous_. \"Oh, that stuff happened, people just don't remember it.

Personally, I'd be happy with any three of the front runners, with my heart leaning a bit more towards Edwards than the other two. My main issue with Obama is the lack of a mandate in his healthcare plan (Paul Krugman goes into some detail on why this is an issue <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/opinion/07krugman.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), while Clinton's \"muscular liberalism\" in international relations seems like it needs some real rethinking in light of ... err, reality.<br /><br />The YouTube segments are very interesting indeed. More please? ;) I wish more Worldcon panels and the like were recorded. It just seems so wasteful to have it all disappear into the ether. If you're a private party at a con and you record a panel, what would be required to release it? Permission from the con, and/or permission from participants, or just ones own say-so? Depending on the answer, I may make a habit of carrying some sort of suitable recording device next time I'm at a convention...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"January 10 2008, 22:50:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1200005445,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?replyto=3077598","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3077598#t3077598","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3077598#t3077598","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3077598#t3077598","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nescio17","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nescio17.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3077598,"talkid":12021,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/31198.html?thread=3077598#t3077598","upictitle":"nescio17: pic#0","article":"I'm glad you're excited about Obama.
