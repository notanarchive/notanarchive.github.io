Dragons use tooth and claw, but also flames against each other, even if their scales (at least in the Maester's opinion) make them somewhat immune (but an example is that Sunfyre blinds other dragon using fire).<br /><br />What keeps the dragons from using their flames against the opponent rider, though? Do dragons actively protect the rider from the flames in battle and are always concerned with that? Is it magic (maybe it's not only the scales, afterall)? Do dragons only rarely use flames against each other and can't be trained to do so at command?<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"December 17 2013, 01:16:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"About dragons fighting each other","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/joaoborgesborges2","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Joo Borges Borges","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2325540","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=67859068&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Joo Borges Borges","ctime_ts":1387243005,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/348025.html?replyto=18492537","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/348025.html?thread=18492537#t18492537","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/348025.html?thread=18492537#t18492537","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/348025.html?thread=18492537#t18492537","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lord_varys","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lord-varys.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18492537,"talkid":72236,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/348025.html?thread=18492537#t18492537","upictitle":"lord_varys: pic#0","article":"Tricky question:<br /><br />We all know that one Grand Maester Gerardys was fed to the second Aegon's dragon by the second Aegon himself.
