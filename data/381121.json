I see Sansa, in the books wanting to see the world (although she is a bit naive about it); and in the show, playing the boat game with Shae (where you had to make up where the boat came from and where it was going and why). I see Tyrion wanting to explore the world when he came of age, but not being allowed to do so, because he wouldn't have the money; how interested he was in everything that wasn't home. I don't know if you did that on purpose, or if your experiences just naturally come out in your writing, perhaps a bit of both. Maybe that's why Tyrion is your favorite character? He's a bit like you in many regards from what I see of your life in interviews (although you're a bit taller). He's one of my favorite characters too.
