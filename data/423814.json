{"itemid":1655,"subject":"Puppy Whines","event":"Puppygate is the gift that keeps on giving.  \r\n\r\nEvery time I think I have said all that needs to be said on the subject of the Hugo Awards, one of the Puppies does or says something else egregious, something I cannot let pass.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"568\"/>\r\n\r\nI have tried to have a rational discussions of the issues here, addressing each of the claims put forward by the Sad Puppies and their supporters calmly, with arguments based on facts, history, common sense.  Although I continue to disagree strongly with Larry Correia and Brad Torgersen on... well, on just about everything they say... I've managed to have a civilized and civil dialogue with both.  \r\n\r\nBut beyond the borders of my own Live Journal, the dialogue has been anything but civil.  And it grows more toxic and hateful with every exchange, it seems... especially from the Puppies.  \r\n\r\nYes, it's my old friend \"the Tone Argument\" again.\r\n\r\nWhen we began this exchange, I pointed out that was going to call the Puppies \"Puppies\" because that was what they had named themselves.  I asked for the same consideration, asked that they stop with the \"Social Justice Warrior\" stuff, because that was NOT what my side calls ourselves, and some of us find it offensive.  Instead of respecting that request, the Puppies doubled down.  ALmost every post from them is SJW this, SJW that.  For some, the original term was not enough, so now they are talking about \"Social Justice Whores\" and other twists on the term.  And Brad Torgersen himself, seemingly not content with SJW and SMOF, has gone out of his way to come up with CHORF, a new epithet that he is using at every opportunity.  \r\n\r\nThis is not the way to argue, not the way to exchange ideas, not the way to have a dialogue.  Someone who takes pride in coming up with new mocking epithets and insults to hurl at his opponents is telling the world that he has no interest in debate, that he would rather just spit and hiss and jeer.  And then there's the curious Puppy trick of mocking themselves, with an air of outrage, implying that the hated \"SJWs\" have called them these names... which is bullshit.  Brad's latest blog post, proudly trumpeting that he is a \"hateful hater who hates,\" is just the latest example of this.  Before that, we've had the Puppies calling themselves Wrongfans having Wrongfun, or the Evil League of Evil, and similar stuff.\r\n\r\nIt all boggles the mind.  And of course it leads to surreal arguments that 'their side' is justified in calling our side \"Social Justice Whores\" and the like because our side has called their side \"Wrongfans\" and \"Haters\" -- when, of course, we haven't.  You are calling YOURSELVES that... with sarcasm, sure, but still, you are the guys coining all these new and exciting insults, for both my side and your own.\r\n\r\nLet me ask, once again, for civility.  When the argument is about political issues, I will call your side \"conservatives\" and \"right wingers,\" and I'd ask you to call us \"liberals\" or \"progressives\" or even \"left wingers,\" not SJ-Whatevers.  When we are focused more on worldcon or the Hugos, I will continue to call you \"Sad Puppies,\" and I will take care to differentiate you from the Rabid Puppies... except in cases where you're acting in alliance and agree, where I will just say \"Puppies.\"  And you can call my side \"fandom\" or \"worldcon fandom\" or \"trufans.\"  The two sides use \"fan\" to mean very different things, as I have pointed out repeatedly, which causes some of the confusion.  Here's a new thought: if you insist on calling yourselves \"fans,\" then call us \"fen,\" the ancient, hoary, fannish plural of fan.  Fans and fen, there we go, two terms for two sides, no insults.  Is that so bloody hard?\r\n\r\nAlso... can we please stop it with the moronic World War II metaphors?  Larry Correia is not Churchill, Brad Torgersen is not FDR, and no one is Hitler.  We are not fighting the Battle of the Bulge.  No matter how the Hugo vote goes, no one is going to a death camp to be gassed.  \r\nThis is not a fight for freedom, on which the fate of western civilization depends.  We are talking about a literary award here.  Bottom line, we are arguing about whether the mantle of past Hugo winners like Robert A. Heinlein, Ursula K. Le Guin, Alfred Bester, and Robert Silverberg should be passing to Anne Leckie, John Scalzi, and Jo Walton, or rather to Brad Torgersen, John Wright, and Kevin J. Anderson.  This is an argument about what makes a good story, about prose style and characterization and theme and originality.  We do not need to make it a blood feud.  Have a little sense of proportion, Puppies.  \r\n\r\nAnd really, stop it with all the vitriol.  Or the rest of the world may actually start to take you seriously when you named yourselves 'hateful haters who hate.'","ditemid":423814,"eventtime":"2015-04-27 14:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"tired","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo award, worldcon, puppygate","current_moodid":31,"commentalter":1430328344,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Puppy Whines http://goo.gl/og9Nhk","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"angry","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.687712136006685]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430167021}","revtime":1430328586},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-27 20:36:41","anum":134,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html","event_timestamp":1430145360,"reply_count":141,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/68850712/2268354","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21476230#t21476230","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21476230#t21476230","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21476230#t21476230","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21476230#t21476230","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cuthulu","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cuthulu.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21476230,"talkid":83891,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21476230#t21476230","article":"If I remember correctly, and I was young then, the term Social Justice Warrior began in the 1990's with hardline feminist.

Seems like he is addressing a sword that cuts both ways.  You have Vox who is a hater that hates, but as long as you become a hater of Vox then you really aren't a hater, but rather a clear thinking individual.  But if you disagree with a hater that hates a hater of hates (after a while hates doesn't even look right), then you are a hater yourself?  You may not even agree with the original hater (Vox), but because you also disagree with someone on the far left, you are still labeled a hater.  You are hating the wrong person, even though you may show the same type of disagreement that the supposed enlightened person has shown to the original hater.<br /><br />Clear as mud?<br /><br />I agree that labels can be annoying and unjust, but I can also see some justification there.  Take for the example the individual from Goldsmiths University in England who organized a diversity rally... but banned white people and men from attending.  I would regard that person a SJW due to their actions, that at the beginning are noble (promoting diversity), but in the end let their anger and judgement color their world view and actively discriminate against another group of people.  Perhaps I am wrong in even mentioning this label and example, but as a lifelong conservative (more economically so than socially) this is the person that springs to mind when mentioning SJW.<br /><br />In a positive aside though, this discussion has introduced me to a whole slew of authors that I never knew existed.  My new Kindle is slowly building up its library with people like Kloos, Leckie, Torgerson, and others.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 27 2015, 21:03:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I didn&#39;t get that impression","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://joshmst.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"joshmst","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"joshmst","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://joshmst.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"April 27 2015, 21:10:55 UTC","dname":"joshmst","ctime_ts":1430168621,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21477766#t21477766","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21477766#t21477766","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21477766#t21477766","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21477766#t21477766","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21477766,"talkid":83897,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21477766#t21477766","above":21476742,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Having a rational discussion between disagreeing parties depends upon creating some form of compromise, and I don't think all of the people who you are engaging with seem to want that.<br /><br />And as far as social justice warrior is concerned as an acronym, I believe it is indicative a new sort of leftist politics that has emerged in the past 40-50 years which is more centered around identity, status, the environment, personal autonomy, or simply \"social justice\", as opposed to traditional liberal politics which is mostly about economic justice. Some people call this division the \"old\" and \"new\" left.<br /><br />Conservatives these days are particularly disdainful of the new left because they see their demands/interests as phony (i.e. racial/gender/sexual justice), which is manifested in political correctness. I can see the Puppies of all persuasions as hating these politics. They certainly seem to perceive the Hugos as having been politicized and controlled by the \"new\" left.<br /><br />The vitriol and the trolling is meant to inflame.

Fans are out there who have never had the opportunity before to be involved in the Hugo process, and that's great they are being told, \"you, too, can make a difference.\"  There's the middle ground right there.<br /><br />The compromise would be for everyone to just stop, take a deep breath, and say \"Okay, this is the year of the Puppies.  Next year, it will be different.  The Puppies got a *lot* of people interested in and talking about the Hugo Awards, and all of fandom should be grateful.  Let's all figure out a way to do this better next year so no one group's recommendations sweep the nominations.\"  That's a compromise.<br /><br />I do not believe either Brad Torgersen or Larry Correia ever believed their picks would come close to sweeping the nominations, nor do I believe they should be blamed for the SP3 campaign's success.  That said, this is the first time (that I know of) the Hugo Awards have gotten such national and international attention, and I think that's great.

Anderson because he's written 125 novels, he's sold millions of books, he doesn't get sufficient respect because of the tie-ins he's written, and he's a great writer and a great guy, none of which I have a problem with. But is he really saying THE DARK BETWEEN THE STARS is one of the best SFF novels of 2014, or is it that he wants all his buddies or his favorites to have their turn in the spotlight?<br /><br />I mean, I really like Arlan Andrews, but this is not how I'd have preferred to see him make the Hugo ballot.

Calling somebody a 'liberal' is supposed to be an insult? It's... quite a compliment actually.<br /><br />Am I to assume that somebody who uses the word 'liberal' as an insult is proudly declaring themselves to be disrespectful of opinions that are different to their own, and happily closed off to all new ideas?<br /><br /><br />Or is it purely now some nuance of the gargantuan reality disconnect that is American politics?<br /><br /><br />I don't know though, I think it's a mistake to allow the Sad Puppies to frame this as a Right vs Left issue.

Well, perhaps if you George were the only person on the non-puppy side (whatever you wish to call \"your\" side is fair and fine by me, and should be by everyone IMO), this would be true.  You've asked in your posts here before in recent weeks to provide \"proof\" several times.  Do you wish me to do so here?  As I can quickly link dozens of examples of those arguing against the Puppies in many different blogs/sites, using all kinds of vitriol, names, even uttering what could be construed as threats. <br /><br />BOTH sides are guilty of writing nonsense, calling names, trying to slander, and so forth.  BOTH sides.  Trying to claim the entire \"trufan\" or whatever the name of the week is side has made no offensive remarks (again I refer to the quote of what you said George) is frankly, just wishful thinking.  Again, I'm sure that George and many other respectful, reasonable, and intelligent folks on George's side haven't engaged in such behavior, but trying to throw a protective umbrella over the entire \"team trufan\" because it's most famous voice hasn't behaved badly just doesn't fly.<br /><br />So far as the primary point regarding the use of SJW, I agree, it's a pejorative term which has IMO drifted over from the gamer gate battlegrounds.  And I can also agree that if turnabout was used in some fashion, ie all those on team WorldconFandom began calling those on Puppies \"NeoNazi Truth Deniers\", the NTDs, I think many would be writing a similar post that George just did on that side.<br /><br /><br />I still think this entire Huge/PuppyGate issue is just one more place where the division of America has taken root.  The more I watch the split between right and left, the more I'm convinced that there is NO \"shaking hands across the isle\", and never will be.  Both sides are too far apart, and the middle ground just isn't there - it doesn't exist, not anymore.  The solution then IMO is to have two separate categories for all the events/awards in the Hugos.  Example - Best new Conservative/Right wing Author (I'm sure a better name could be created).  Best new Liberal/Left wing Author.  And so on.  Like it or not, it's the only way the problem can be fairly solved, as any other solution I can think of will just breed more argument.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 27 2015, 23:35:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://garracornish.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"garracornish","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"garracornish","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://garracornish.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"April 27 2015, 23:41:17 UTC","dname":"garracornish","ctime_ts":1430177702,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/22416633/3266187","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21488518#t21488518","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21488518#t21488518","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21488518#t21488518","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21488518#t21488518","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"smofbabe","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21488518,"talkid":83939,"etime_ts":"1430178821","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423814.html?thread=21488518#t21488518","above":21486982,"upictitle":"Smofbabe: platy","article":"You are failing to make a distinction between what the wide swath of people who make comments to blog posts say and what the leaders of the movement are saying.
