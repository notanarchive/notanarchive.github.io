{"itemid":769,"subject":"The Social Media","event":"So here's the thing.  I am a dinosaur, as all my friends will tell you.  A man of the 20th century, not the 21st.  Yes, I have been using a computer for twenty years now, but while I cruise this interwebby thing with a PC and Windows, I still do all my writing on an old DOS machine running WordStar 4.0, the Duesenberg of word processing software (very old, but unsurpassed).  I have my website, which someone else runs for me, and I have this LJ account, the blog that I vainly called my Not A Blog in hopes that might prevent me from blogging.\r\n\r\nBut that's it.\r\n\r\nI am not on Facebook.  \r\n\r\nI am not on Twitter.\r\n\r\nI will not be on the next new thing to come along, the one that makes Facebook and Twitter as obsolete as GEnie and CompuServe and The Source, those halcyon communities of yore.\r\n\r\nNow some of you may think you've seen my page on Facebook.  Others may swear they've read my tweets.  Wrong and wrong.  'twas not me.  Friends of mine who do these things inform me that there are several Facebook pages with my name on 'em.  Some seem to be the work of well intentioned fans, and do nothing but copy my posts from here.  Others are the work of trolls, established for purposes of abuse, since Ty keeps a lid of that kind of crap on LJ.  A few are rank imposture, I hear, featuring nasty comments by assholes pretending to be me.  The same sort of stuff is going on with Twitter, I'm told.\r\n\r\nI have neither the time, the energy, or the inclination to get on any of these social media myself.  There's WAY too much on my plate, and keeping up with the Not A Blog and my website are taxing enough.  So here's what I've done.  I've given my friend Elio... better known to the denizens of Westeros as Ran... permission to syndicate my posts and comments on both Facebook and Twitter.  \r\n\r\nHere's the URLs:\r\n\r\n    http://twitter.com/westerosorg\r\n\r\n    http://www.facebook.com/Westeros\r\n\r\nThese Westeros sites will post my own stuff, yes... but also a lot of other material about the novels and TV shows.  \"Our social media sites are, we think, a pretty good place to keep on top of the latest news related to you and your projects,\" Elio writes.  Just so.\r\n\r\nAnd these are the ONLY social media feeds I've authorized.  If you want to follow me on Facebook or Twitter, accept no substitutes.\r\n\r\n(Well, in English.  Let me modify that statement.  I have given some of my foreign fan sites permission to translate my posts into other languages, so if you are reading this in Klingon or Dothraki, you're just fine).\r\n\r\nAnd now we return you to your regularly scheduled programming, and me to Skull Island, where Kong is staggering a little.","ditemid":197075,"eventtime":"2011-02-17 00:15:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"the internet","current_moodid":105,"commentalter":1299080501,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":495,"picture_keyword":"angry","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"15:4,45:2,8:28,10:2,31:2,33:2,11:2,23:2,32:4,1:24,3:12,4:12,20:8,9:32,nterms:no","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1299253181},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-02-25 07:14:51","anum":211,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html","event_timestamp":1297901700,"reply_count":68,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110501783/33279968","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260307#t12260307","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260307#t12260307","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260307#t12260307","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rawr_balrog","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rawr-balrog.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12260307,"talkid":47891,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260307#t12260307","upictitle":"Shannon: konzen and goku","article":"Livejournal is far superior to all other social networking outlets anyway.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"February 25 2011, 07:17:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rawr-balrog.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rawr_balrog","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rawr_balrog","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rawr-balrog.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rawr_balrog","ctime_ts":1298618241,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/59314397/12464566","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260819#t12260819","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260819#t12260819","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260819#t12260819","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cursed_mage","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cursed-mage.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12260819,"talkid":47893,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197075.html?thread=12260819#t12260819","upictitle":"Gladius: pic#59314397","article":"I guess your blog is enough source of information for most people that likes your work.

Great Russian master Mikhail Baryshnikov performs play and it was very exciting! Sister Mila came with me to see ballet and I think she falls in love with Mikhail! After play she runs up to him and tries to grab onto piece of costume. I think she has something to drink beforehand, yes? Ha ha ha! <br /><br />She was also enjoying capitalist luxuries of the New York while we were visiting. She buys many pairs of shoe, and I ask her why she needs more than one pair! Great craftsmanship of Petersburg shoes should be enough! :)<br /><br />I am sorry for long story. I remember hearing you are of New York and it brings back memory of trip. I am wondering if you, too, have ever seen the great master Baryshnikov at work?<br /><br />On a similar notion, perhaps WILD CARDS comes to ballet sometime? Would it not be grand and funny? Would be interesting to be seeing Dr. Tachyon and The Great and Powerful Turtle on stage!
