I managed to get Thunderbird working again, and everything is now fine... well, aside from the fact that I am about three thousand emails behind, but that's the usual state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who commented or emailed or otherwise offered help.  I appreciate all your suggestions.\r\n\r\nI will be taking steps next week to make certain the problem does not recur.","ditemid":320596,"eventtime":"2013-04-19 19:50:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_nocomments":1,"taglist":"everyday life, computer woes","current_moodid":91,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","give_features":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-04-20 01:50:35","anum":84,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320596.html","event_timestamp":1366401000,"reply_count":0}
