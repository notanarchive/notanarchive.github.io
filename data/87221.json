{"itemid":340,"subject":"STAR TREK","event":"Saw the new STAR TREK movie last night.\r\n\r\nNo spoilers here, just a resounding thumbs down.  Take a pass.\r\n\r\nThe actors do a very creditable job of creating young versions of all the familiar characters from Classic Trek, but the writing sucks start to finish, and the science fictional aspects are ludicrous even for STAR TREK.  Fans of the old show might like the film... but then again, maybe not, since it's a \"reboot\" (Hollywoodese for \"retcon\") and pisses all over the original continuity.\r\n\r\nMe, I think they should just let this tired, tired franchise die.  STAR WARS too.  I don't ever need to see another wookie, or another klingon.  (They won't, of course.  Not so long as there's one more nickle to be made.  I know how Hollywood works).\r\n\r\nI love SF, and I love space opera, but can't we have some new characters in a new universe?  Even BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was a retread, albeit a much more interesting one than anything Trek or SW has done in decades.  We did have FIREFLY, short lived as it was... but there's room for more.  Let's have television versions of Honor Harrington and Miles Vorkosigan.  Let's have someone film the Praxis series by Walter Jon Williams, the best space opera I've read in years.  Let's have anything that isn't Trek or STAR WARS.\r\n\r\nIf they really must remake old shows, screw it, let them remake Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, or Rocky Jones, Space Ranger.

Most of the stuff in the old (and new!) shows hardly makes sense...so just sit back and enjoy!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"May 10 2009, 22:16:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://fatham.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"fatham","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"fatham","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://fatham.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"fatham","ctime_ts":1241993760,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?replyto=6126773","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6126773#t6126773","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6126773#t6126773","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6126773#t6126773","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6126773#t6126773","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"chocotaco33","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://chocotaco33.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6126773,"talkid":23932,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6126773#t6126773","upictitle":"chocotaco33: pic#0","article":"I, like most, really liked it.  I see your point about making the SF sloppy and sacrificing some of the feel of The Original Series in order to cater to the action movie-loving masses.  But you at least have to admit that the action in most Star Trek incarnations is usually, well, pretty lame and this was a breath of fresh air from that perspective at least.  A few other points:<br /><br />I would love to see new SF on the big screen, but it seems like everything out there is either for a niche audience, or people just haven't figured out how to market it to the public without ruining it.  Instead we get the occasional crap SF flick (e.g. Chronicles of Riddick) or SF in other mediums (e.g. Battlestar).  Hopefully Ender's Game will be the 21st Century SF we're all hoping for.<br /><br />I don't think the \"they messed up the continuity\" argument holds water.  They made it pretty clear that this is an alternate reality, one that exists side-by-side with the old one. Was this an all-too-easy deux ex machina on the part of the writers? Sure.  But in this rare case I think it was necessary to satisfy the old fans (an impossible task but at least they made the gesture) as well as having the freedom to break away from the original storyline. Like you said, as long as there's money to be made on these franchises they aren't going anywhere. So as long as they're here, I'd rather have them reinvented instead of rehashed.<br /><br />And lastly, the thing I liked most about the movie was how very, very reinvented it was. This James T. Kirk wasn't the old one, he was a hardened, in-your-face Kirk as a result of growing up without a father. The previously stoic, nearly emotionless Spock was replaced with one who was FORCED to have emotion in the face of his planet's destruction, as well as unexpected love. Is it the greatest writing ever? Nah. But compelling enough to be fresh and satisfying? In my opinion, yes.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"May 10 2009, 22:17:12 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://chocotaco33.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"chocotaco33","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"chocotaco33","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://chocotaco33.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"chocotaco33","ctime_ts":1241993832,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/38190200/2751502","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?replyto=6153653","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6153653#t6153653","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6153653#t6153653","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6153653#t6153653","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kathrynthefair","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kathrynthefair.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6153653,"talkid":24037,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6153653#t6153653","above":6126773,"upictitle":"kathrynthefair: newyearicon","article":"i totally agree!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","below":6265269,"ctime":"May 11 2009, 13:37:52 UTC","parent":6126773,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kathrynthefair.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kathrynthefair","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kathrynthefair","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kathrynthefair.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kathrynthefair","ctime_ts":1242049072,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6265269#t6265269","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6265269#t6265269","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6265269#t6265269","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"angrylagomorph","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://angrylagomorph.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6265269,"talkid":24473,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6265269#t6265269","above":6153653,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","parent":6126773,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://angrylagomorph.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"angrylagomorph","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"angrylagomorph","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://angrylagomorph.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"angrylagomorph","ctime_ts":1242743059,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/64347815/13454704","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?replyto=6127541","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6127541#t6127541","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6127541#t6127541","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6127541#t6127541","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cissie_king","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cissie-king.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6127541,"talkid":23935,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html?thread=6127541#t6127541","upictitle":"Arrowette: Arrowette","article":"I would like to see a remake of 1999... as soon as I can figure out what it should be called.
