Thank you so much for giving me your email address! I'm sorry for responding in your comment section again. You have a privacy setting which hinders me from messaging you. I'm Jesse Resurreccion, who has been emailing you through a student account at: jesse.resurreccion@students.marist.org<br />I forgot to mention that part, my bad. Anyways keep making your books wonderful. Your works rewrote Marist, and you are gold and a permanent gem of pride in our school. No matter who challenged or doubted you in the past, you are NOW and will ALWAYS be a great legacy of English American Literature. Always keep the flame and wonder in your writing, because you won't always know how much someone else cherishes it. I have my peace knowing that I was able to relay the message. Irregardless of my fate and future, you will always be my hero. Good Luck and I hope you find inspiration and joy writing \"The Winds of Winter.\"<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                               ~ naviblu1516/J.R.
