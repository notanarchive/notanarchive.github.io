{"itemid":1409,"subject":"The Rogues Are Coming...","event":"&nbsp;. . . and much sooner than expected.\r\n\r\nOur good friends at Bantam Spectra have just informed me and my partner-in-crime Gardner Dozois that they have moved up the publication date of our next mammoth crossgenre anthology ROGUES. . . to June 17.&nbsp; Yes, <u><i>this</i></u> year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three months from now, in other words.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed WARRIORS and DANGEROUS WOMEN, we think you&#39;ll love ROGUES.&nbsp; It may be our strongest anthology yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have some amazing writers and some incredible stories in this one.&nbsp; The table of contents, as previously announced:\r\n\r\nGeorge R.R. Martin &ldquo;Everybody Loves a Rogue&rdquo; (Introduction)\r\nJoe Abercrombie &ldquo;Tough Times All Over&rdquo;\r\nGillian Flynn &ldquo;What Do You Do?&rdquo;\r\nMatthew Hughes &ldquo;The Inn of the Seven Blessings&rdquo;\r\nJoe R. Lansdale &ldquo;Bent Twig&rdquo;\r\nMichael Swanwick &ldquo;Tawny Petticoats&rdquo;\r\nDavid Ball &ldquo;Provenance&rdquo;\r\nCarrie Vaughn &ldquo;The Roaring Twenties&rdquo;\r\nScott Lynch &ldquo;A Year and a Day in Old Theradane&rdquo;\r\nBradley Denton &ldquo;Bad Brass&rdquo;\r\nCherie Priest &ldquo;Heavy Metal&rdquo;\r\nDaniel Abraham &ldquo;The Meaning of Love&rdquo;\r\nPaul Cornell &ldquo;A Better Way to Die&rdquo;\r\nSteven Saylor &ldquo;Ill Seen in Tyre&rdquo;\r\nGarth Nix &ldquo;A Cargo of Ivories&rdquo;\r\nWalter Jon Williams &ldquo;Diamonds From Tequila&rdquo;\r\nPhyllis Eisenstein &ldquo;The Caravan to Nowhere&rdquo;\r\nLisa Tuttle &ldquo;The Curious Affair of the Dead Wives&rdquo;\r\nNeil Gaiman &ldquo;How the Marquis Got His Coat Back&rdquo;\r\nConnie Willis &ldquo;Now Showing&rdquo;\r\nPatrick Rothfuss &ldquo;The Lightning Tree&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTwenty stories not enough for you?\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, we&#39;ve decided to add a twenty-first, for all you fans of fake history.\r\n\r\n&quot;The Princess and the Queen,&quot; Archmaester Gyldayn&#39;s somewhat abbreviated account of the Dance of the Dragons, got a great response from all the folks who read it in DANGEROUS WOMEN, so we&#39;ve dipped back into the archmaester&#39;s somewhat disorganized piles of scrolls and crumbling manuscripts, and brought forth another piece of his unpublished history.&nbsp; &quot;The Rogue Prince, or, the King&#39;s Brother,&quot; will tell the story of the years leading up to the calamitious events of &quot;The Princess and the Queen&quot; during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen, with particular attention to the role played by the king&#39;s brother, Prince Daemon, a rogue if there ever was one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you&#39;ll enjoy it as much as you did &quot;The Princess and the Queen.&quot;\r\n\r\n(And yes, sadly, &quot;The Rogue Prince&quot; is an abridged account as well.&nbsp; For the full version, you will all need to wait some years, until we publish the complete history of House Targaryen in the GRRMarillion... which, by the way, I&#39;ve decided I am going to call FIRE AND BLOOD, since the GRRMarillion joke has grown somewhat stale by now).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;We&#39;re got something for everyone in ROGUES -- SF, mystery, historical fiction, epic fantasy, sword and sorcery, comedy, tragedy, crime stories, mainstream. And rogues, cads, scalawags, con men, thieves, and scoundrels of all descriptions. If you love Harry Flashman and Cugel the Clever, as I do, this is the book for you.\r\n\r\nOh, and speaking of DANGEROUS WOMEN... it&#39;s now HUGO NOMINATION time, and we have lots of great stories in both DW and OLD MARS that are eligible, so I hope you&#39;ll remember some of them when filling out your ballots.","ditemid":360936,"eventtime":"2014-03-12 11:56:00","props":{"current_mood":"hyper","current_location":"Santa Fe... for now","taglist":"bantam spectra, anthologies","current_moodid":52,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1485401689,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"revtime":1396316631},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-03-12 17:56:11","anum":232,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html","event_timestamp":1394625360,"reply_count":87,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/53246017/3446648","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18785512#t18785512","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18785512#t18785512","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18785512#t18785512","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18785512#t18785512","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thefirstalicat","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thefirstalicat.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18785512,"talkid":73380,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18785512#t18785512","upictitle":"thefirstalicat: CuriousityArty","article":"Sounds good - perfect summer reading!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"March 12 2014, 18:18:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thefirstalicat.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thefirstalicat","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thefirstalicat","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thefirstalicat.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thefirstalicat","ctime_ts":1394648316,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117741044/50525087","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18787560#t18787560","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18787560#t18787560","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18787560#t18787560","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1262507","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/burca.adrianclaudiu","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18787560,"talkid":73388,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/360936.html?thread=18787560#t18787560","above":18785512,"upictitle":"Burcă Adrian Claudiu: pic#117741044","article":"But an even better summer reading would be THE WINDS OF WINTER.<br />George, make it happen.

Thank you very much!<br /><br />1. Will 'Fire and Blood' focus completely on House Targaryen (encompassing its time on Dragonstone and Valyria) or will it also cover other topics as well (history of Westeros pre-Conquest)? From what we have already heard about the GRRMarillion thing you should have written enough material on the history of the Targaryen rule of Westeros to cover one huge volume...<br /><br />2. Is 'The Rogue Prince' going to stop before the Dance of the Dragons, or will it shed (at least) some light on Prince Daemon's rather erratic actions throughout the war (i.e. his deteriorating relationship to Rhaenyra (?), and whatever the thing between him and Nettles was in the end)?<br />It would be great if the story could shed some light on that as well as on Daemon's past.<br /><br />3. Any chance of meeting the dragon of Viserys I in that story?<br /><br />4. Any chance on giving us a version of the conclusion of the Dance in the same fashion? The rates for the bets of the manner of death of Aegon II are already pretty high...<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to Daemon's clashes with Ser Otto, the campaigns in the Stepstones (was this an all-out war, or merely 'an adventure'?), Laenor and Laena, and a younger Queen Who Never Was. And please don't forget to give us a really good glimpse of Rhaenyra in her prime as the Realm's Delight. She should have won that war!<br /><br />Oh, and any hint whether Baelon's identity is going to be revealed in that story? The scholary circles really start use the big guys trying 'to prove' that the Baelon Jaehaerys I chose over Rhaenys was either Viserys/Daemon's father, Rhaenys' brother, or from a different line of Jaehaerys/Alysanne.
