(I'm a diehard Dresden Fan)<br /><br />But I listened to many of the other stories and found them to be amazing! The voice actors gave fantastic performances of these well written pieces. <br /><br />From this anthology, I found <i>Wildcards</i> and read the first two books. I have no idea how I missed them all these years.<br /><br />I also read Cecelia Holland's <i>The Secret Elenor</i>.<br /><br />Thank you for helping me fill out my summer reading list. :)<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"November 13 2014, 15:03:25 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://orionsmom.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"orionsmom","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"orionsmom","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://orionsmom.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"orionsmom","ctime_ts":1415891005,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124483323/36582828","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389280.html?thread=19740576#t19740576","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389280.html?thread=19740576#t19740576","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389280.html?thread=19740576#t19740576","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"insurrbution","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19740576,"talkid":77111,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389280.html?thread=19740576#t19740576","upictitle":"insurrbution: pic#124483323","article":"Congrats George!! <br /><br />I have 'At the Mountains of Madness' on my reading list and am looking forward to getting to it.

To be perfectly honest, I didn't read the whole thing (I checked it out of my local library, and there was no way I could renew it because the waiting list was already a mile long by the time I got it an it only got longer behind me by the time the due date arrived). <br /><br />In any case, I did manage to read a pretty decent chunk of it, and I liked most of what I read. One of the great things about anthologies like this is it gives one a chance to sample works one would otherwise never encounter. As a fan of <span  class=\"ljuser  i-ljuser  i-ljuser-type-P     \"  data-ljuser=\"jimbutcher\" lj:user=\"jimbutcher\" ><a href=\"http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/profile\"  target=\"_self\"  class=\"i-ljuser-profile\" ><img  class=\"i-ljuser-userhead\"  src=\"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10\" /></a><a href=\"http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/\" class=\"i-ljuser-username\"   target=\"_self\"   ><b>jimbutcher</b></a></span>, I had to pick it up for \"Bombshells,\" and as a fan of your work, I had to pick it up for \"Princess and the Queen.\" But I also wound up enjoying things I wasn't expecting to enjoy - <span  class=\"ljuser  i-ljuser  i-ljuser-type-P     \"  data-ljuser=\"mistborn\" lj:user=\"mistborn\" ><a href=\"http://mistborn.livejournal.com/profile\"  target=\"_self\"  class=\"i-ljuser-profile\" ><img  class=\"i-ljuser-userhead\"  src=\"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10\" /></a><a href=\"http://mistborn.livejournal.com/\" class=\"i-ljuser-username\"   target=\"_self\"   ><b>mistborn</b></a></span>'s \"Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell\" and Joe Abercrombie's \"Some Desperado\" in particular stand out. And it's a good thing that it wasn't purely science fiction/fantasy anthology, because otherwise, I <b>definitely</b> never would've read Megan Abbott's \"My Heart is Either Broken,” or Lawrence Block's \"I sure know how to pick them.\" The later in particular... I'm not sure I necessarily <i>liked</i> it per se, but I could appreciate it for the well-written work that it was.<br /><br />But I'm rambling a bit. Once again, congratulations on a well-deserved win.
