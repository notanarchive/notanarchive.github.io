{"itemid":525,"subject":"Wolves in the Night","event":"Saw the remake of THE WOLFMAN tonight.  Great visuals, and Rick Baker's makeup was spectacular, as always (I much prefer the traditional 'wolfman' look of the old Universal classics, which Baker updates here, to the hydraulic-snout werewolves of AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, THE HOWLING, THE WOLFEN, etc).  Overall, though, I'd give the movie a C, maybe a C+.  Anthony Hopkins kind of phones in it, and Benicio del Toro is no Lon Chaney, Jr.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of things that go bump in the night, a new producer has been attached to my own werewolf movie-in-development, \"The Skin Trade,\" according to CNN:\r\nhttp://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/marketwire/0587869.htm\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, March creeps ever closer, and with it the HBO decision about whether or not to greenlight the GAME OF THRONES series.  I am pretty much out of the loop on this, so there's nothing I can do to impact it either way... but as much as I have tried to adopt a \"que sera, sera\" attitude, I'm growing increasingly anxious.  All sorts of rumors swirling around the internet, both good and bad.  And of course Hollywood has broken my heart before.  Ask me politely and I'll show you my DOORWAYS scars...\r\n\r\nLast but not least, there's Meereen.  Can I just drop a hydrogen bomb on the damn place?\r\n\r\nSigh.  Well, tomorrow is another day.  At least when I'm in Westeros, I forget all about what may or may not be happening at HBO.","ditemid":134581,"eventtime":"2010-02-19 00:33:00","props":{"current_mood":"anxious","taglist":"the skin trade, a game of thrones, a dance with dragons, hbo","current_moodid":4,"commentalter":1425405475,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":255,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:5,18:6,11:5,38:5,42:3,3:27,24:13,25:32,5:3,19:5,4:13,26:15,9:10,nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1425405504},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-02-19 07:33:07","anum":181,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134581.html","event_timestamp":1266539580,"reply_count":94,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125892066/12651694","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134581.html?thread=8820661#t8820661","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134581.html?thread=8820661#t8820661","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134581.html?thread=8820661#t8820661","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134581.html?thread=8820661#t8820661","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"animeshon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://animeshon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8820661,"talkid":34455,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134581.html?thread=8820661#t8820661","upictitle":"animeshon: bring it","article":"I have my fingers crossed with regards to the HBO series.
