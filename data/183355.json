{"itemid":716,"subject":"G-Men","event":"Almost caught up on my football.  Last night we watched the Giants / Seahawks game.\r\n\r\nHoly crap.  What a beating.  Not exactly the most suspenseful contest we've seen this season, but there is a certain rough pleasure in watching your guys just whale the tar out of another team.  And it certainly beats being on the losing end of such of a pounding, as the G-Men were several times last year down the stretch.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it looked to me as if the Seahawks just stopped playing about halfway through the second quarter.  If so, that's worrisome for you Seattle fans.  I remember when Pete Carroll coached the Jets.  Only one season.  The team just quit on him after the infamous Marino fake spike game.  Maybe Carroll really is better suited to the college game.\r\n\r\nI have to believe that Seattle is not nearly as bad as they looked.  I'd like to believe that the Giants are as good as they looked... but I don't, not really.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrific game for Eli and his receivers, though.  That long TD pass to Nicks was a thing of beauty, as was the thread-the-needle pass to the double-coevered Kevin Boss.  And the RBs kicked some ass too -- Ahmad Bradshaw, Brandon Jacobs, even Danny Ware.  Though by the time that Ware came in, the 'Hawks were playing two-handed touch.  The Giants D also looked great, though given how quickly the score got lop-sided, we probably should have had more sacks.  Poor Whitehurst was passing on almost every play.\r\n\r\nKudos to Tom Coughlin too.  To my mind, he coached the blowout exactly right.  He took out Eli and the starting RBs right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and instead of trying to run up the score he just ran the ball straight into the line with Ware for play after play after play to chew up the clock and end the massacre.  Even at the end, with the Giants inside the Seahawk ten, he had Rosenfels kneel down four times rather than push in another TD.  That, to my mind, is sportsmanship... and stands in sharp contrast to the crap that Evil Little Bill was pulling when he had his 18-1 team and set all those scoring records.  Let the other guy leave with a little dignity.\r\n\r\nStill have Giants/ Cowboys II and Jets/ Browns to watch.  Then we'll be caught up.  But of course there are two new games tomorrow.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Westeros, I am wrestling with krakens.","ditemid":183355,"eventtime":"2010-11-20 18:07:00","props":{"current_location":"home!","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1291866874,"personifi_word_count":428,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","personifi_tags":"35:6,10:3,11:8,37:6,23:4,3:14,25:6,4:8,39:6,9:22,21:6,13:27,nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-11-21 01:07:40","anum":59,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html","event_timestamp":1290276420,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117094227/2289645","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?replyto=11338555","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338555#t11338555","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338555#t11338555","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338555#t11338555","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jere7my","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11338555,"talkid":44291,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338555#t11338555","upictitle":"jere7my: Glasses","article":"Allow me to be the first to say: get kraken!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"November 21 2010, 01:12:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jere7my","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jere7my","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jere7my","ctime_ts":1290301937,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?replyto=11338811","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338811#t11338811","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338811#t11338811","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338811#t11338811","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"us41044","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://us41044.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11338811,"talkid":44292,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/183355.html?thread=11338811#t11338811","upictitle":"Brandt Warstler: pic#106023921","article":"That was a painful one to watch brother.

Those kids should be getting paid to play for all the money they generate the for the school and for the NCAA. Fair market value, please.<br /><br />What is sad is how choosy the NCAA is with its enforcement, since the \"problem\" is certainly not an isolated one. Taking away a national championship and a Heisman without a Delorean powered by 1.28 GW of power is impossible anyway. We all watched the game. We all know what happened. If you can prove to me that Reggie getting a nice-ish car (seriously, it was like a '97 Impala) and a modest house for his parents from people who had no affiliation with USC somehow made him play better, then I cede the point. Perhaps being able to afford healthy food rather than ramen noodles made him bench more, I don't know.<br /><br />What Reggie Bush did was akin to getting a bank loan from a private citizen based on a promise of future earned revenues. The NCAA's archaic position on this type of thing is a big reason why athletes declare for the draft early. Everyone is getting paid but them. How is that fair? <br /><br />Why should these guys be risking injury with no compensation? And don't give me that tired old argument that the free education is compensation, because most of the star players barely go to class. The players know why they're there. The schools know why they're there. The fans know why they're there. Let them earn what they can. Regulate it, make it above board, and you'll have yourselves a fair system.
