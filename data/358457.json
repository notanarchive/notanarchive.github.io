Me too! :-DDD<br /><br />Unbelievably I'd never heard of Game of Thrones until last year when I wanted to watch a tiny bit of ep1, just to know what all the fuss was about on twitter et al. media.<br /><br />After ep1 I started on book 1 and read all 5 in one go until last week.<br /><br />Book 4 is so epic and I can't wait to see it on TV. If it wasn't for you, Mr. M, we wouldn't have the pleasure of waiting at all in the first place. Very very grateful for your creative world and all the characters in it.<br /><br />Thank you! :-)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"February 17 2014, 17:29:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Bouncy","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/erika.schneider.7315","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Erika Schneider","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2435661","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69006956&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Erika Schneider","ctime_ts":1392658145,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122772007/68918430","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/358457.html?thread=18736953#t18736953","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/358457.html?thread=18736953#t18736953","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/358457.html?thread=18736953#t18736953","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2426996","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/philip.gouldon","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18736953,"talkid":73191,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/358457.html?thread=18736953#t18736953","upictitle":"Philip Gouldon: pic#122772007","article":"The Purple Wedding and the duel of all duels look beautifully shot.
