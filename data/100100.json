Slash fanfiction is a good example, as no matter how many fangirls/fanboys insist two characters the creator made aren't gonna be together like that (Dumbledore/Grindelwald not withstanding). Not to mention fanfiction is often written by one person alone, sometimes just as a fulfillment of the authors wishes.<br /><br />So I didn't make the best comparison, but I can definitely understand why some authors wouldn't want fanfiction based on their properties.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 17 2009, 03:15:54 UTC","parent":6852868,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://panda-s1.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"panda_s1","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"panda_s1","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://panda-s1.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"panda_s1","ctime_ts":1250478954,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/59950720/3466288","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?replyto=6856452","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6856452#t6856452","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6856452#t6856452","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6856452#t6856452","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"joechummer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://joechummer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6856452,"talkid":26783,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6856452#t6856452","above":6854404,"upictitle":"joechummer: Jade Falcon","article":"The reason most authors dissuade fan fiction based on their works is because author lawyers fear the possibility of their clients being sued by fans that claim the author stole an idea from their fan fiction to use in their own published work.  Probably the most well-known of these instances involved the late Marion Zimmer Bradley (you can look this up if you want).<br /><br />So, based on this information, let's say someone posts a GoT RPG campaign module they wrote for their gaming group to an RPG forum, so that other GoT game masters can try it out with their own group.  When A Dance With Dragons comes out, let's assume this fan reads the book and finds a part in the novel that (to him, at least) sounds like the idea came DIRECTLY from the RPG campaign HE wrote!  \"How dare GRRM steal my idea!\" he thinks.  In this instance, what is to keep the fan from trying to sue GRRM?<br /><br />From what I understand, the act of writing fan fiction -- or an RPG campaign -- is not discouraged, so long as people keep it to themselves.  But as soon as you publish something in a fanzine or in a forum or some other public venue, that's where the line falls.  And people in the gaming community enjoy sharing with other gamers.  I'm just trying to figure out whether there's some kind of proviso in the rulebooks of a book-series-based RPG that would protect the author in cases like this.  Something like, \"The material and universe presented in the this book is TM and (C) by [author], and all adventures written using this material are for personal use only.\"<br /><br />Myself, I don't like fan fiction as a creative outlet or a writing exercise, because if you have the talent to write a good yarn, you're much better off doing so in a universe you make yourself, with characters you have come up with.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 17 2009, 04:57:03 UTC","parent":6854404,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://joechummer.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"joechummer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"joechummer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://joechummer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"joechummer","ctime_ts":1250485023,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/95574964/7740058","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?replyto=6853380","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6853380#t6853380","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6853380#t6853380","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6853380#t6853380","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ichthyosaur","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ichthyosaur.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6853380,"talkid":26771,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100100.html?thread=6853380#t6853380","upictitle":"i challenge you to fisticuffs: (animal) what I think of you","article":"That is some pretty wicked cover art.
