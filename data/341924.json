Jets Win!","event":"<p>Life is magical and filled with joy...\r\n\r\nFor this night, at least.&nbsp; The Jets are only 4-3, true, but they beat the Patriots.&nbsp; Any time we can take down Evil Little Bill and Tom Brady, it&#39;s a day for rejoicing.\r\n\r\nOur rookie QB has been blowing hot and cold all season, as rookies will.&nbsp; Today, aside from that one pick six, he was hot.&nbsp; He looked really sharp, in truth.&nbsp; And the Jets D just keeps getting better and better.&nbsp; Whatever you say about Rex, he knows how to build a great D.\r\n\r\nEven so, the Jets almost blew it, allowing Brady and the Pats to tie up the game in the final seconds and send it into overtime.&nbsp; But in OT, the D came up big, and Geno and offense did just enough to get Nick Folk into range for the winning field goal... aided, I must admit, by a personal foul penalty that I am sure has all the Pats fans howling.&nbsp; I&#39;d be howling too if the teams had been reversed.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means the worst call of the afternoon, however.&nbsp; That distinctiion has to be reserved for a totally bogus offensive pass interference call that negated a beautiful long TD bomb from Geno to Stephen Hill.&nbsp; If that TD has counted, as it should have, there never would have been an overtime.&nbsp; So I guess it all evened out in the end.\r\n\r\nThe Pats still lead the AFC East and will likely win it.&nbsp; The Jets may not even make the playoffs.&nbsp; As well as they played this week, they could be awful next week.&nbsp; It has been that kind of up and down season.&nbsp; But tonight at least gives Gang Green fans another whiff of hope.&nbsp; Maybe Geno is for real.&nbsp; That D sure is.\r\n\r\n</p>","ditemid":341924,"eventtime":"2013-10-20 21:43:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1382456924,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1382460888},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-10-21 03:43:40","anum":164,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/341924.html","event_timestamp":1382305380,"reply_count":26,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/112406283/40486258","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/341924.html?thread=18353828#t18353828","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/341924.html?thread=18353828#t18353828","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/341924.html?thread=18353828#t18353828","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_746431","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/cres34","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18353828,"talkid":71694,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/341924.html?thread=18353828#t18353828","upictitle":"Joel Calhoun: pic#112406283","article":"Watched that today...almost makes up for the Saints loss last week at Foxborough.

Probably not enough to make the playoffs (although there's a chance 9-7 could grant you a wildcard), but a solid season for a team that can still evolve in a lot of aspects. If they draft well, I can see the Jets as playoff contenders for the next few years.

He threw a pick-6 in Sunday's game and has 14 turnovers so far this season. But I don't think Geno Smith has to be amazing for the Jets to succeed. Just look at Joe Flacco.
