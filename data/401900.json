Wild Cards is a wonderful book and I hope the new books come soon. There are 21 in english (i think) but only one in german. But i am sure this will change! It is amazing how popular you became and I hope I can find enough time to read all your books.<br />Also I wanted to say, take your time to write all books you are going to write! There are two possibilities: take the necessary time to write such a complexe master piece lika the previous books, or write it fast destroying the Song of Ice and Fire. <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 12 2015, 20:18:14 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Wild Cards Germany","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://leonardo-igler.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"leonardo_igler","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"leonardo_igler","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://leonardo-igler.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"leonardo_igler","ctime_ts":1421093894,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401900.html?thread=20095212#t20095212","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401900.html?thread=20095212#t20095212","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401900.html?thread=20095212#t20095212","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2061527","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/114400443216575220644","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20095212,"talkid":78496,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401900.html?thread=20095212#t20095212","above":20087788,"upictitle":"ext_2061527: pic#0","article":"There are 22 Wild Cards books published up to date. <br />Penhaligon, the German publisher, has acquired the rights for books 18,19 and 20.

Let's hope to see books 19 and 20 in 2015.<br /><br />In the 90s the first 6 Wild Cards books were already published by Heyne in Germany. They splitted the books, so there are 10 German books with the content of the original ones. You can find them on amazon Marketplace or on ebay easily.<br /><br />Depending on the success of the books 18-20 in Germany, we will see, if some old books will be republished.
