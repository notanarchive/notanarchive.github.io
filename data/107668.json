{"itemid":420,"subject":"The NFL Returns","event":"Life is magical and full of joy!!!\r\n\r\nHaloo, halay, the Jets and Giants won today.\r\n\r\nSolid, convincing victories for both teams.  Not quite total domination, no, but the scores would have been even more lopsided if not for a couple bad turnovers.\r\n\r\nThe Jets were the morning game.  Mark Sanchez made his debut with Joe Willie Namath on hand to root him on.  Can't ask for a better omen than that.  Based on what I saw today, we have a quarterback, we have a coach, and boy, do we have a defense.  Harris and Scott and Jenkins were monsters (though Vernon Gholston, finally given a chance to start, was still invisible).  Of course, it was the Texans, so one can't read too much into this.  Still, a road victory, and there were commentators who claimed this was going to be the year when the Texans turned the corner.  I loved the play when Kris Jenkins just swatted a Texan lineman aside one-handed to charge past him to the QB.  Next week will be the real test, when the Jets and their new defense and their kid QB face the Patriots.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, and it was the G-Men.  The game was not nearly as close as the final score.  One of the Washington touchdowns came on a fake field goal at the end of the half, the other in garbage time as the clock was winding down on the Giants victory.  Albert Haynesworth, the big free agent acquisition Danny Snyder made this year, did help throttle the Giants running game, kinda sorta, though if you add Bradshaw and Jacobs together, they still had more than a hundred yards.  Eli made up for it, and won the game through the air.  (We won't mention that ghastly interception).  The Giant defense harassed Jason Campbell all day, and completely shut down Santana Moss, the Redskin deep threat.  Favorite play was Osi stripping Campbell of the ball, picking it up, and running it in for a TD.  The only downer on the day was the injuries.  Danny Ware was lost right at the start of the game, and Hakeem Nicks sprained an ankle in the second half.  Next week will be the real test for the Giants as well, when they have to face the hated Cowboys in Jerry Jones' Temple of Excess with its infamous punt-blocking scoreboard.  \r\n\r\nThat's next week, though.  Tonight, at least, it's all smiles in the Big Apple, and down here in Santa Fe as well.\r\n\r\n(Comments welcome, but stay on topic.
