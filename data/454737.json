{"itemid":1776,"subject":"You Missed It","event":"Hiya kids, hiya, hiya.\r\n\r\nHey, you missed the fun.  Last night's appearance by the Suicide Girls at the Jean Cocteau was amazing.  Sellout crowd, and an amazing sexy raucous nerdilicious show.  Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, Thriller, Rocky Horror... oh, and a bit with a girl and three dragons.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/306679/306679_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nTonight the Suicide Girls will be performing down in Albuquerque, at a much bigger venue... but they seemed to like the intimacy of the Jean Cocteau, and our audience certainly loved it.\r\n\r\nAfter Albuquerque, they have dates in Tucson, Phoenix, Las Vegas (Nevada, not New Mexico), and San Diego before winding up their current tour.\r\n\r\nhttp://blackheartburlesque.com/\r\n\r\nIf they come to a city near you, check it out.  (And no, burlesque is not just for dirty old men any more.  In fact, there were probably more women than men in our auditorium last night.  Lots and lots of couples.  And everyone went out hooting and hollering and smiling).\r\n\r\nWe hope to welcome to Suicide Girls back to Santa Fe again next year.","ditemid":454737,"eventtime":"2015-11-17 16:42:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, burlesque","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Nov 17 23:41:06 2015]R [Tue Nov 17 23:41:08 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/666763021767696384 ","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1448234416,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/666763021767696384","picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":3,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.690441756425777]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1447803896}","revtime":1448406389},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-11-17 23:41:02","anum":81,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html","event_timestamp":1447778520,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123938375/72139716","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23038801#t23038801","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23038801#t23038801","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23038801#t23038801","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2750928","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/april.macaroni","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23038801,"talkid":89995,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23038801#t23038801","upictitle":"April Wilson: pic#123938375","article":"So glad you had fun, for that lineup, I might have to look into going myself. :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"November 17 2015, 23:46:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/april.macaroni","striked":1,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"April Wilson","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2750928","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72139716&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"April Wilson","ctime_ts":1447804017,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116017419/46543985","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039057#t23039057","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039057#t23039057","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039057#t23039057","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1053583","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/TheRedViper","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23039057,"talkid":89996,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039057#t23039057","upictitle":"Oberyn Martell: pic#116017419","article":"<br />Lucky guy.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"November 17 2015, 23:48:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Lucky","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/TheRedViper","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"TheRedViper","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1053583","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=46543985&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"TheRedViper","ctime_ts":1447804138,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039825#t23039825","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039825#t23039825","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039825#t23039825","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"gman109","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23039825,"talkid":89999,"etime_ts":"1447823976","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/454737.html?thread=23039825#t23039825","upictitle":"gman109: pic#0","article":"Fantastic.
