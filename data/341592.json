I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert on the subject, but I am a huge fan of movie theater popcorn, to the point I'm sure many affliction-sufferers are, where I will enter a theater just for the popcorn and take it home where I watch whatever I please.  I'm a fan of the fluffy, unsalted white type with just the right amount of added salt and butter flavoured \"goo\", as opposed to the dry, deflated yellow salty variety you can buy at Kmart or Target while mom shops.  My dad doesn't like any popcorn that isn't sweet, so I've dabbled in flavoring air-popped types at home, varieties like butter pecan and spicy thai peanut.  I've recently received a tasty-sounding marshmallow popcorn recipe that I will undoubtedly try next.  I've never been able to recreate the pink \"candy corn\" beloved by my father in his childhood, however.  I'd love to hear more about this gourmet popcorn that you intend to bring back!

We used an organic popping corn grown by the Amish and shipped out from the midwest.<br /><br />There's the oil you pop it in.  Air popped is great, but they don't make air poppers big enough for theatres.  The multiplexes mostly use coconut oil, the cheapest, nastiest of the choices.  Not healthy, and not tasty either.  We use sunflower oil.  (Safflower oil and canola oil are good choices too, better than coconut, but we prefer sunflower.  Olive oil is also good, but has a distinctive taste that some people do not like).<br /><br />Then there is the butter.  No, not \"goo,\" not \"Golden Flavor,\" not that permanently liquid yellow grease you get at the multiplex.  Even margarine need not apply.  We use REAL butter.<br /><br />Lastly, the extra toppings.  We offer parmesan cheese, brewer's yeast, cinnamon-sugar, chile powder, garlic salt, and sea salt.  Use as much or as little as you like.  No extra charge.<br /><br />Add it all up: best popcorn in town, no contest.
