{"itemid":998,"subject":"The RPG is Coming","event":"Cyanide Studios and Atlus Entertainment have just unveiled a trailer for their forth-coming GAME OF THRONES videogame RPG.  If you missed the official premiere and presentation in Paris,\r\nhere's a look.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"240\"/>\r\n\r\nI'll be the first to admit that I have not played a lot of videogames myself.  It's not that I don't enjoy them; rather, I enjoy them too damned much.  Parris often says that Sid Meier owes her, seeing as how I lost a novel to RAILROAD TYCOON and another one to PIRATES.  But looking at this, I can't help be impressed by how far game graphics have come.\r\n\r\nI haven't played the game myself yet, but the Cyanide gang has visited me a couple of times in Santa Fe to give us presentations, and discuss details of game play and background.  They are presenting original stories here, with characters of their own creation, but it was important to them (and to me) that they get the look and feel of Westeros right, and I think they have.  Their enthusiasm and passion for this project is palpable.\r\n\r\nThis preview has me very excited.  It's another way to visit Westeros, for those of you who can't get enough, and maybe the game will even help fill some of those long years between books.","ditemid":255631,"eventtime":"2011-12-21 11:42:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"cyanide, videogame, rpg, game of thrones","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1325518174,"give_features":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-12-21 18:59:25","anum":143,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/255631.html","event_timestamp":1324467720,"reply_count":57,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114825780/17225956","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/255631.html?replyto=15054223","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/255631.html?thread=15054223#t15054223","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/255631.html?thread=15054223#t15054223","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/255631.html?thread=15054223#t15054223","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hiyokonojinsei","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hiyokonojinsei.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15054223,"talkid":58805,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/255631.html?thread=15054223#t15054223","upictitle":"Hiyoko: ShanonKasuul (madebyme)","article":"Ohh, I love videogames and this would definitely be one I'd like to play.
