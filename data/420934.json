I'm not claiming victimhood for these guys, but from where I sit I do see instances of what they are talking about.  I don't think this is only a Hugo problem, but one that affects a lot of thinking throughout the western world.<br /><br />I don't believe there to be a secret cabal of people whose only aim is to take down conservative authors, or those particular ideas.  I think it is just a popular knee-jerk reaction to side with those who accuse others of every -ist and -ism.  Nobody wants to be around somebody that is hateful, plus you don't want to be associated with someone who has that label applied to them.  Conservatives are racists and misogynists and hate the poor.  Libertarians are all nutsos.  Tea Party folks are the worst of the bunch.<br /><br />Well guess what, a good chunk of conservatives are fairly religious people who follow the word of Christ and help those around them no matter the circumstance.  Those who preach hate are a pretty small, but vocal group.  Libertarians want to be left alone and most often go by the golden rule in their interactions with others.  The Tea Party movement grew from a belief that the Constitution should be upheld and that everyone is created equal.  Sure, we can find the exceptions and those people very well can be the -ists and -isms that we hear a lot about.  But it is far more likely for you to bump into one of those people and have more in common with them than differences.<br /><br />Watch the news from the major sources and see what they tend to cover and not cover.  How the stories are presented.  Just remember that when watching or reading any narrative, you are more likely to agree with someone that says the same things that you often think.  When you feel that you are a normal, logical human being... your opinion must be correct.  Meet someone with another opinion that is the polar opposite, it is terribly easy to think them dumb/misguided/evil.  All we can hope for is that you take the time to perhaps find some common ground with that other person (especially if they are willing) and see things from the other side.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 15 2015, 23:03:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Unfortunate...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://joshmst.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"joshmst","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"joshmst","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://joshmst.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"joshmst","ctime_ts":1429139032,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/23696393/2686881","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21176134#t21176134","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21176134#t21176134","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21176134#t21176134","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21176134#t21176134","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lornkanaga","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lornkanaga.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21176134,"talkid":82719,"etime_ts":"1429142546","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21176134#t21176134","above":21173062,"upictitle":"lornkanaga: Friday","article":"Agreed.<br /><br />I'm just glad Mr. Martin has decided to let it go.

I hope you don't, because I want my own Hugo one day, but I don't care, from the naivety of nonameville, who gives it to me, or nominates me, and I suspect there are many nonames out there thinking the same thing, and I can't be the only one you, Correia, and everyone else involved have inspired.<br /><br />So thank you.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 16 2015, 00:34:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://erinfondue.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"erinfondue","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"erinfondue","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://erinfondue.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"erinfondue","ctime_ts":1429144458,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120538078/2771344","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21183814#t21183814","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21183814#t21183814","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21183814#t21183814","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"redfield79","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://redfield79.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21183814,"talkid":82749,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21183814#t21183814","upictitle":"LMF-AO: Arya Stark","article":"<p dir=\"ltr\">We all love smell of blood muahahahaha</p>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 16 2015, 01:14:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://redfield79.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"redfield79","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"redfield79","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://redfield79.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"redfield79","ctime_ts":1429146858,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124836050/75239200","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21193030#t21193030","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21193030#t21193030","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21193030#t21193030","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"seanswanwick","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://seanswanwick.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21193030,"talkid":82785,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21193030#t21193030","upictitle":"Sean Swanwick: pic#124836050","article":"The Hugos are unrecoverable, man--it's a miracle they lasted this long.  Look back on the past sixty odd years as a treasured gift, not a promised right.<br /><br />When I was a teenager a man approached me at Philcon, deeply apologetic that he hadn't voted for my father's short story for that year's Hugo.  He then pulled out a ballot, laid it down on the table, and carefully went over every other story in the category, explaining the exact reasons why his story was less worthy of the award than each other story.  I hadn't ready any of them, even my father's--at the time I didn't read anything he wrote, out of fear they'd be bad and he'd still be my father--but I still got to be told how THIS work wasn't as good but it was by a new author and had more exciting ideas, and how THAT work showed greater mastery of the form and had stronger characters, more excitement, and a better plot.  Eventually I told him, \"Hey, you've gotta pick the story you think is best, no matter who wrote it,\" and he sighed in relief and left me to to back to playing Dungeons and Dragons.<br /><br />At the time, I thought he was a tremendously rude asshole who had decided to insult my dad in the most thorough way imaginable, but with time comes perspective, and now I realize he was really struggling with the choice--he liked the story, he liked ALL the stories, and insulting most by choosing one was genuinely difficult for him.  I'm really glad I managed to say something positive instead of telling him to dive in a lake.<br /><br /><br />Today, you can't start a vote like that.  An award with genuine prestige will be drowned by the 'net.  If anyone can vote, and worse yet any is ENCOURAGED to vote, then you lose that delicate consensus reached by the small minority of the most dedicated fans.  That one rude weirdo put a lot of time and thought into picking the story most deserving of the Hugo, but that effort can't possibly compete with someone who hasn't poured over nearly every story to come out that year but HAS got an even slightly popular blog--and neither can compete with someone who has political beliefs that sync up with those of an online community with disposable income.<br /><br />No rules changes to the voting process will fix things.  What can you possibly do, against the combined creativity and weight of the internet?<br /><br />Maybe it's just time to start caring about the Nebula Awards.  Besides, they look cooler.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 16 2015, 02:37:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Forget it, George--it&#39;s the Internet","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://seanswanwick.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"seanswanwick","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"seanswanwick","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://seanswanwick.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"seanswanwick","ctime_ts":1429151828,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/84137471/8672940","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21197382#t21197382","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21197382#t21197382","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21197382#t21197382","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"figmaniac","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://figmaniac.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21197382,"talkid":82802,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21197382#t21197382","upictitle":"figmaniac: Evil Midnight Bomber","article":"Sometimes you just have to come to the conclusion that you already have - spinning wheels can only go so far.

Beyond that, it's not a bad thing that you and Mr. Correia disagree on some key points in this discussion, and a good thing to see two visible figures on opposite ends of a volatile conflict disagreeing while showing civility. I credit you both.<br /><br />The other thing is I'm not sure if your disagreement is as deep as it seems at first glance. There are core disagreements, but I'm seeing a lot more common ground beneath the surface.<br /><br />I believe both of you are sincere in your desire for the fandom to be as inclusive as possible. I believe you have seen the obstacles women and minorities have encountered in breaking into the community, as well as some of the aggressive behaviour in resistence to it. I also believe Mr. Correia has encountered aggression toward him for ideological disagreement, and that he has been the target of unfounded accusations of racism and sexism. I suspect you would both agree that this type of behaviour is prevalent and wrong on both sides. The difference in your views on this matter are grounded in how pervasive you see this aggression against different targets.<br /><br />I believe both of you opposed to the vitriol of people like Vox Day. I believe that neither of you condones the types of things he says. I believe you disagree on how Mr. Correia can best use his influence as a leader on the other side. I believe you perceive his refusal to take some responsibility for Vox's involvement and denounce him as something that enables bigots to jump into the fray, whereas I believe he considers a refusal to publicly condemn someone like Vox as a bulwark against the slippery slope of guilt by association that can lead moderates and dissenters to fear speaking out.<br /><br />I believe both of you are opposed to the types of sweeping accusations of racism and misogyny levied against people like Mr. Correia and Mr. Torgersen and the divisive rhetoric of people like Arthur Chu. I believe the disagreement here is on the pervasiveness of these accusations. I believe you perceive this as the type of toxicity that flies back and forth on the internet that both sides are certainly guilty of. I believe he perceives the readiness of multiple media outlets to publish these types of accusations without sufficient fact checking as evidence of a strong institutional bias, extending beyond petty internet aggression.<br /><br />I believe both of you want a system that's fair for people with a diverse range of perspectives. I believe Mr. Correia perceives a level of ideological homogeneity that created a hostile environment for people on his side strong enough that it required a response, whereas I believe you perceive his response as an act of polarization that creates conflict and hostility for people on your side of the conflict.<br /><br />I may be off the mark with some of your views or his, but I believe you're both fed up with the ideological polarization that's taking place all over the internet right now. And I believe you're both frustrated by the back-and-forth harassment that erupts all too easily when people disagree on the internet. And you're probably right that neither of you has swayed the other. But you've done something more important than that.<br /><br />You've given your side permission to engage with Mr. Correia and his side, as humans, just as he has with his side toward yours. There are a lot of common values between the two sides, with most of the true disagreement coming from how to prioritize those values, where the cultural biases are, and what needs to be done to find solutions. And this isn't about the Hugos. It's a broader polarization along ideological lines that's been growing throughout many areas of Western culture, as well as a blindness to our own prejudices in areas that challenge our binding moral belief systems.<br /><br />Neither of you could have ever been the winner in this debate. But every time someone in your position reaches out publicly to someone like him, it shows people we can disagree while still respecting each other's basic humanity, a step toward de-polarization. The first step in moving beyond this culture war is for more people on both sides to recognize the humanity of people we disagree with.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 16 2015, 19:24:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Is it worthwhile?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wilsoncc.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wilsoncc","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wilsoncc","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wilsoncc.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wilsoncc","ctime_ts":1429212274,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/100113188/13746263","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21234246#t21234246","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21234246#t21234246","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21234246#t21234246","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wendigomountain","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wendigomountain.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21234246,"talkid":82946,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21234246#t21234246","upictitle":"Clint Harris: Drinky","article":"By the SP's rationale, since GRRM's books do better and he has a TV series, he wins the argument! ;)<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 16 2015, 19:44:24 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wendigomountain.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wendigomountain","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wendigomountain","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wendigomountain.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wendigomountain","ctime_ts":1429213464,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124840266/75123410","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21257542#t21257542","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21257542#t21257542","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21257542#t21257542","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"catastronauts","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://catastronauts.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21257542,"talkid":83037,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420934.html?thread=21257542#t21257542","upictitle":"catastronauts: pic#124840266","article":"I was pretty set on the \"No Awards\" option for voting, but after I read one of your blogs and mulled it over for a few days, I changed my mind.  <br /><br />So, one mind was changed.
