{"itemid":1215,"subject":"Superbowl","event":"Congrats to the Baltimore Ravens and their fans, and condolences to the fans of the 49ers.\r\n\r\nAnother exciting Superbowl.  Used to be that the big game was a blowout more often than not, but the last few years have seen some exciting contests.  For once, it was a great defensive goal line stand that won the game.  Something fans of D like me see all too seldom.  (Of course, the Niners playcalling on first-and-goal from the five left much to be desired.  Too many passes to Crabtree.  I would have gone with Gore Up the Gut four times.  If they had, I'd be congratulating San Francisco right now, I suspect).\r\n\r\nOf course, this year can't compare with last year's thrilling Giants win, but hey, that's the NFL.  Glory is fleeting.  The G-Men will be back.","ditemid":311224,"eventtime":"2013-02-04 01:04:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1360790905,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1360790917},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-02-04 08:04:32","anum":184,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311224.html","event_timestamp":1359939840,"reply_count":40,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/112357458/40426938","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311224.html?thread=17231544#t17231544","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311224.html?thread=17231544#t17231544","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311224.html?thread=17231544#t17231544","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_744014","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1219474487","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17231544,"talkid":67310,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/311224.html?thread=17231544#t17231544","article":"Congrats to the Ravens. It was a hard fought game and they deserved to win considering the play of the Niners during the first half. That said I think they should have been called on offensive holding for that last play. It was pretty blatant.<br /><br />Otherwise I think that the only other injustice of the game was not giving the MVP to Jacoby Jones. No other player had a greater impact on that game. His 70 yard touchdown was ridonculous. Then his return for the touchdown? Without those two plays, the Ravens lose. Flacco did a great job.
