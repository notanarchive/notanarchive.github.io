{"itemid":886,"subject":"The Maid of Tarth","event":"I see you guys are just as sharp as ever.  The long layoff between first and second season casting hasn't made you rusty.  Once again, you nailed my obscure hints within minutes.\r\n\r\nWell, okay, I did fool a few of you.  For a couple minutes, anyway.  But others correctly puzzled out the casting.  The part of Brienne, Maid of Tarth, will be played by British actress GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000gx6d3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000gx6d3\" width=\"416\" height=\"277\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis was another one of those cases where there was hardly any debate.  The day the first batch of auditions went up for the role, we looked at a dozen actresses who were reading for Brienne and one actress who WAS Brienne.  Gwendoline gave a great reading, and her look was just perfect.  No, when she auditioned, she did not look she does in the photo above.  She came in looking... well, like Brienne.\r\n\r\nAs for my clues... Christie played in a music video called DAMARIS, which includes a song about Isabelle, the She-Wolf of France (wife of King Edward II, for the history nerds out there), and played in Shakespeare's CYMBELINE at the Barbican theatre. She also posed for Australian photographed Polly Borland for a show called \"Bunny.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000gy527/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000gy527\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nShe also appears in the recent IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSAS, though I did not use that one in my clues.\r\n\r\nGwendoline will be a great Brienne.  It's a thrill to have her join the cast.  \r\n\r\nCongratulations to everyone who figured it out... and for those who guessed wrong, well, better luck next time.","ditemid":227044,"eventtime":"2011-07-07 22:29:00","props":{"current_location":"santa fe","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1311095152,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"hiya hiya hiya","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1311095193},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-08 04:29:51","anum":228,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html","event_timestamp":1310077740,"reply_count":106,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/72978064/3449572","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14173924#t14173924","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14173924#t14173924","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14173924#t14173924","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"marinshellstone","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://marinshellstone.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14173924,"talkid":55366,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14173924#t14173924","upictitle":"Map-Maker, Lighthouse-Keeper: Brienne the Beauty","article":"AWESOME! cannot WAIT.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 8 2011, 04:35:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://marinshellstone.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"marinshellstone","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"marinshellstone","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://marinshellstone.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"marinshellstone","ctime_ts":1310099738,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119381793/9908582","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14174180#t14174180","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14174180#t14174180","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14174180#t14174180","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"i_luv_stanislav","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://i-luv-stanislav.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14174180,"talkid":55367,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html?thread=14174180#t14174180","upictitle":"Kristen: OUAT - {Red}","article":"So excited and pleased that Gwendoline got the part!
