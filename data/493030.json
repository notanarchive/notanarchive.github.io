{"itemid":1925,"subject":"Pretty Dany Moneyeyes","event":"This wild ride I have been on for this last decade just keeps getting wilder.\r\n\r\nThe amount of GAME OF THRONES stuff out there boggles even me.   \r\n\r\nHere's the latest:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"744\"/>\r\n\r\nI have not seen this one in person myself.   I understand there is one at the Sky City casino down near Acoma, west of Albuquerque.   Whether Sandia or Camel Rock or any of the other Indian casinos nearby have them I don't know, though I suspect they do.\r\n\r\nI don't go to casinos very often, and when I do I prefer to play poker or blackjack with other human beings rather than the slots, but I'd play this one.   In fact, I want one for myself.  Though I have no idea whether it is even legal for an individual to own a slot machine, or if you need a casino to be able to have one.   \r\n\r\n(I do have the GAME OF THRONES pinball machine.  Which is very cool itself).\r\n\r\nWhat's next, you ask?
