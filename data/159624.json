This is not an official translation of George R. R. Martin's interview in the magazine. Any mistakes are either due to scribal error, or my lack of translation skills. I'm taking a short break, but will be back with part two after dinner.]<br /><br /><b>Hello!</b><br />Mr. Martin?<br /><b>Yes, glad to meet you.</b><br />Hello, We're calling from Spain.<br /><b>Yes, glad to hear you.</b><br />We had an interview today, I think.<br /><b>Yes, I'm ready. You too?</b><br />Yes, [we're ready] too.<br /><b>Good.</b><br />We are Triada Magica, first of all thank you for the opportunity provided.<br /><b>You're welcome.</b><br />If you don't mind, we'll go directly to questions.<br /><b>Onwards, please.</b><br />First, what memories do you have of your work as a scriptwriter for television series such as Beauty and the Beast?<br /><b>Yes, I participated in two series when I was in Hollywood. I worked on \"Beauty and the Beast\" and also \"Twilight Zone\", the 1980 revival series of \"The Twilight Zone\", and those were very good experiences, which I enjoyed. It was a very special, very heartwarming job. I worked with some producers on Beauty and the Beast, like R. Fish and P. Roman. It was wonderful to write for them. We had a magnificent team of writers there too. I worked with other people, like Alan Brennet and Rodney Brennan on \"Twilight Zone\" and Marc Castle on \"Beauty and the Beast\". In the end, it was a very good experience for me. I enjoyed it.</b><br />Did they leave room for creativity, or were there some kinds of restrictions or impositions by the producers of the series?<br /><b>You mean in both series, when he was on \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Twilight Zone\"?</b><br />Yes, in both.<br /><b>Yes, well, Twilight Zone was my first show. My first experience with scripts, or most of those scripts adapted from existing stories written by other authors. Yeah, I wanted to concentrate. I was new to Hollywood and to television and wanted to concentrate on learning more than the story, therefore, of the five scripts for Twilight Zone, four of them were adaptations where the story was given to me. The fifth was an original story. Later, when I was on \"Beauty and the Beast\", it was quite different, because all my stories there were original and I was a writer and on the production team. We were a good team, you know, had no great creative differences. The producer, Ran Cusslow, was very happy with the things that we created.</b><br />Do you follow any series now?<br /><b>Any type of series?</b><br />Yes, any type.<br /><b>Well, I see quite a bit of television. You know, I'm enjoying \"Lost\" right now, I am following the series \"Lost\" and I watch other kinds of series. I was a big fan of the new season of \"Galactica\" up to the end. I did not like that ending at all, haha, but the follow up to the end. And, of course, HBO has a large number of works that have been very, very impressive. In recent years, I'm a big fan of \"Deadwood\", if you have no such series in Spain, they are great shows.</b><br />This question is not very original, but some of the followers of our blog begged us to ask it: when did you decide you wanted to be a writer?<br /><b>Oh, I've always written, even as a young child, I used to write lots of stories of monsters, and read them to other kids where I lived. And this happened even when I went to school. In high school I was a big fan of comics. I wrote little comics that appeared in several magazines and amateur fanzines. Well, I was in high school in the 60s. My first story was when I was in college, my first fiction story, when I graduated in 1970, and at that moment I was completely convinced that I wanted to be a writer. I did not know if I could live by it or would have to have another job and write in the evenings and weekends. It took me about ten years of working on other things and writing in my free time before becoming full-time writer in 1980.</b>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 1 2010, 22:03:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Translation of the interview (part one)","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://neoqbirdie.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"neoqbirdie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"neoqbirdie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://neoqbirdie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"neoqbirdie","ctime_ts":1278021791,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67764944/13643290","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?replyto=10442888","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10442888#t10442888","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10442888#t10442888","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10442888#t10442888","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"neoqbirdie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://neoqbirdie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10442888,"talkid":40792,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10442888#t10442888","upictitle":"neoqbirdie: pic#67764944","article":"[Disclaimers: same as before. I hope this is a little more readable, but some of the sentences still got away from me.]<br /><br />That's very interesting. Your main influences include Tolkien, Jack Vance, Tad Williams ... yet the basis for Song of Ice and Fire is more realistic and based more on medieval history in mythology. Where does this influence come from?<br /><br /><b>Well, yes, when I started \"Song of Ice and Fire\" I wanted to make a combination from mixing the traditional fantasy like Tolkien, with some realism and predisposition of the major historical traditions. I always read the two. I've been reading writers like the great American historical writers Thomas V., Frank Kirby, and the great work of French writer Maurice Dranosuon, whose books were translated as \"The Accursed Kings\", i.e., I've read a lot of historical fiction and, of course, lots of history. I wanted to incorporate  some of that into \"Song of Ice and Fire\" to make a compendium of both traditions.</b><br /><br />Writing a book with such a variety of characters, each with his own personality, history and different development, one assumes it to be a huge organizational effort. Especially taking into account the length of the story. Do you use some organizational method for maintaining the entire story in that wonderful balance?<br /><br /><b>Well, the majority is in my head. I mean I wrote notes, genealogies and worked out things like that, and I made maps, but the majority of all that thought came along the road. Spend a year designing everything before you write, and then just start to write and tell the story and put all the ideas in order. I may not be as organized as I should, so in a project of this [embergadura?], I lost too much time going back and forth trying to remember what color were the eyes on that person, or as it was when I left off, but most of it is basically in my head or in a huge file loaded on my computer.</b><br /><br />What is the origin of the story? Namely, what inspired you to start a story so vast and rich?<br /><br /><b>I never thought it would be so large when I started. I thought it was going to be a trilogy. I've said many times, in fact I didn't know where the story came from. I was writing another book, in 1991, in the summer of 1991, and had begun another project, a science fiction novel that had been planned for some time. I was doing a lot of work all day and I suddenly had the idea for the first chapter of \"Game of Thrones\". Not the prologue, but the first chapter, Bran's chapter, which describes the Warg wolves in the snow. The characters came to me so vivid and clear I knew I had to translate that, so I parked the other book, and wrote that chapter. It took me several days and I already knew there had to be a second chapter, that is, I kept writing \"Game of Thrones\". I never went back to the other book, and continued from there. It took me a few years, and has grown slowly to this point, but I am still on the road I started that day, and really I have no idea where the inspiration came from. But it has burned in my head for a long time.</b><br /><br />We imagine that to undertake a challenge of this scale must be exhausting and require much energy to carry it out. Did you know when you started this adventure that it was going to be something so big?<br /><br /><b>I didn't think so. When I started in 1991 I didn't know what it was. Like I said, it was a chapter, but at the end of summer I knew I had a book, probably a trilogy. Finally when I showed it to the publisher in 1994, I had made clear that it was a trilogy, that is, they were originally going to be three books. Now I am thinking of seven books. I am working now in the fifth and the aim is to finish in seven books. It grew much more than I anticipated it would.</b><br /><br />Which character is the hardest to write?<br /><br /><b>The hardest character to write about is Bran, because he's so young, you know? He's the youngest of all the characters, so you have to remember what it was like to be a kid, and you have to think about what he would understand and would not understand, to see the world differently than as we see it.</b><br /><br />And do you have a predilection for any of the characters?<br /><br /><b>Well, I love all the characters, I mean they are my children, but Tyrion I love the most. Tyrion is my personal favorite, Tyrion Lannister.</b>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 2 2010, 02:17:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Translation of the interview (part two)","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://neoqbirdie.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"neoqbirdie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"neoqbirdie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://neoqbirdie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"neoqbirdie","ctime_ts":1278037025,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67764944/13643290","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?replyto=10443144","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10443144#t10443144","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10443144#t10443144","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10443144#t10443144","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"neoqbirdie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://neoqbirdie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10443144,"talkid":40793,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/159624.html?thread=10443144#t10443144","upictitle":"neoqbirdie: pic#67764944","article":"[Disclaimer: Same as before, again.]<br /><br />Do you suffer as much a we do when a character dies in the book?<br /><br /><b>Oh, probably more than you actually.
