{"itemid":289,"subject":"But Enough About the Hugos","event":"Moving right along, I wanted to mention that all my copies of the Guardians of Order RPG book are now gone, including the remaining copies that were water-damaged in the floor.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that I may have a box or two of additional copies in my storage locker, but I won't know that until work is complete on my Library Tower, and I can empty out the locker and start unpacking long-lost books.\r\n\r\nThanks for the interest, everyone.  I hope those of you who got the books enjoy 'em.","ditemid":74237,"eventtime":"2009-02-19 16:34:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":93,"opt_nocomments":1,"taglist":"hugo awards, fandom","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-02-19 23:36:48","anum":253,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74237.html","event_timestamp":1235061240,"reply_count":0}
