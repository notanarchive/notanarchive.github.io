Editor Gerald Hausman will be joining us for the evening, together with writers Trent Zelazny, Jane Lindskold, M. Scott Momaday, Rebecca Godfrey Poe, Peter Lauritzen,  Peter Eichstaedt, Jim Terr, and Alice Carney.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/440292/440292_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nOne week later, on Sunday April 9, we'll once again be hosting one of our favorite people, the one and only CONNIE WILLIS.  Connie's got a new book out: CROSSTALK, her long-awaited romcom, and as usual it's a delight... as is she.  Of course, we'll have her other books as well, the many Hugo- and Nebula-award winners, and the one or two that were only runners-up.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/442148/442148_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/441502/441502_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/441794/441794_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nJust a few days later, on Saturday April 15, we will have the honor to host one of New Mexico's own treasures, JOHN NICHOLS, the author of THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR.
