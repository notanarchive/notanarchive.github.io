{"itemid":2081,"subject":"EXPANSE Soars","event":"Last night's episode of THE EXPANSE was really strong, I thought.   And I was pleased to hear that the show has been renewed for a third season.\r\n\r\nJimmy Corey's books and the TV series based on them have both gotten a fair amount of acclaim -- awards attention and the like -- but not nearly enough, imnsho.  The show had a good first season, but it's only gotten stronger in season two.  If it keeps on at this level, it deserves to be ranked among the best SF shows of all time.

Hmmm. I don't know about this.<br /><br />Not to be all black pill or show up here and be some jagoff contrarian and poop all over the thread, but here goes: I'm not <i>nearly</i> as enthused or enthralled as some folks seem to be re: The Expanse; and it kind of alarms me (considering the feelings I have about it) to think that something which appears to me to be sliding into mediocrity at best without anyone seeming to notice either means everyone is getting hypnotized/colonized by some sort of <i>Expanse</i> <b>VIDEODROME</b> signal, or I am turning into an even bigger dick with each ep I watch.<br /><br />I only got into it a few weeks ago. Took me the first 2.5 eps for it to get its hooks in me; I almost gave up, cynically pegging it as an <i><b>Outland</b></i> ripoff/remake in series form. Some of the dialogue seemed forced initially, and there were a couple times my suspension of disbelief was suspended, but other than those minor complaints, by Ep.3, I was, as I said, hooked. I binge-watched the rest of the season from midnight to 8 a.m., and it felt like a film (always good). Dug the story development, politicking, the protomolecule idea. Effectswork (particularly the ship battles) made me hit pause/rewind a few times so as to drink them in properly, the writing was funny, nice and dry in spots and seemed to improve with each ep. The character interaction kept me guessing and interested.<br /><br />Then came Season Two. By Ep 4, I was getting pretty skeptical. By where we are now- well, let's just say that I've gone from deep interest and even allowing myself to be moved, to finding myself snickering/scoffing derisively. Never a good feeling to have, that going from joy and commitment to over-familiarity and near-contempt. Like falling in love at first sight, getting married in Vegas, and then finding out you married a callgirl with felony warrants and 3 other husbands. Kind of like I feel about <i><b>Star Wars</b></i>/J.J. Abrams. <br /><br />So there's the backstory where I pretend like anyone cares. Here's my cheesy whine:<br /><br />1. The storyline has slid into utter predictability. I've been able to plot and predict, successfully, each of the last three episodes before airing with a disturbing percentage of accuracy. For skeptics reading this, I'll be more than willing to give you the main story points of this coming Sunday's episode, and I will be right about every bit of it. I won't do that here because someone would likely try to have me doxxed and murdered. But I'm not exaggerating my claim, and that bothers me. The awful \"Gunny\" dialog, the addition of Prax (and his daughter) being done so incredibly lazily and so utterly predictably. Wow, my mind is <i><b>B L O W N</b></i>, I can't figure out what happened, and I <i>sure</i> as hell can't figure out what role Prax and his daughter are going to play in all this next!!1! The suspense is killing me! C'mon now.<br /><br />2. I'm still watching. Again, effects are great, cool ideas executed fairly well, etc. But the writing team has gotten lazy. I fear that part of the reason (if not the <i>main</i> one) so many folks in fandom, as well as \"casual\" fans of science fiction (the <b>Eternal Normie</b>) are seemingly uncritical of the show is the fact that there's been a genre-drought on television, and as we often have to fight to get even a desultory nod towards us we're willing to put up with a lot. Many industry types are contemptuous of us, and we spend a lot of time wishing sempai would notice us, so seldom is heard a discouraging word. God forbid we be too critical of the bones they throw us. <br /><br />That's the only way I can explain this why this descent- over one season- from drama to drivel- continuing to be so uncritically lauded at this point. The show has gotten actually <b>bad</b>, and it's like I'm living an Emperor's Clothes scenario. Or, again, it's turning me into a bigger jerk than usual. And honestly, I promise- I'm <i>not</i> one of those guys who picks everything apart to try and look smart and smug (I actually have a 3-D waifu and kids and IRL friends). I <i><b>HATE</b></i> those guys. I'd love for the show to go back to being awesome- but right now... well, there <i>is</i> just one ep left, I believe.<br /><br />Thank <b>GOD</b> the new season of Rick and Morty is starting.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 weeks ago","ctime":"April 15 2017, 14:35:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/104615765932207524489","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Scout Wellsrain","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4089329","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81676398&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Scout Wellsrain","ctime_ts":1492266953,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126988931/80328214","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26014434#t26014434","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26014434#t26014434","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26014434#t26014434","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3966624","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1124887310942332/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26014434,"talkid":101618,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26014434#t26014434","above":26012130,"upictitle":"Williamjames Hoffer: pic#126988931","article":"Wow.

I could say that I'm an admirer of A Song of Ice and Fire, but that's not true. I don't just admire A Song of Ice and Fire, I study it. I chew on it and I bath in it. Mr. Martin, out of all the books that I have read, from Tolkien to Eddings to Rowling, I have never experienced anything even close to being so realistic and dynamic as A Song of Ice and Fire. Mr. Martin, I love you, and I respect you more than any writer I've ever known or known of. COMBINED. Mr. Martin, I have sought out and begun to apply every shred of advice I could find from you. I am immersing myself in the subjects relevant to what I want to write. I am trying to put myself in the skin of my characters, and I am reading everything I can get my hands on(except erotica. You can understand that, I'm sure. I've got parents who worry after me). I'm writing when I don't feel like it, and then when I get to writing I'm absolutely in love with it. I'm not putting any limits on my imagination, borrowing a few things from history so as to add to the realism, and making sure my characters are firmly grey as real people are, avoiding cliches and I'm not sparing anything when it comes to the blood and violence and everything of war and death.<br /><br />Please Mr. Martin, you are so wonderful, so utterly delightful. Please give me more advice. I HUNGER to learn more from you, Mr. Martin. I want to be able to write as realistically as you do. Mr. Martin, when I start reading your books, I can't STOP. Their ADDICTIVE. If I were an addict, you are my crack cocaine. I don't just WANT to learn more from you, Mr. Martin. I NEED to learn from you. Please, I hope you find me worthy of having your years of wisdom and experience bestowed upon me. I would be honored to receive word from you, Mr. Martin. Even if you refuse to offer me wisdom and guidance, I will have been honored that you spoke to me at all. Or even if you do not RESPOND in any way, shape, or form, I will be honored that you have read this and given it thought.<br /><br />Mr. Martin, may you have a blessed day, and a blessed week, and even farther, a blessed year. I have but the kindest wishes for you. Oh, and happy Easter!<br /><br />Faithfully yours,<br />                           Shawn Patrick Daniels","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 weeks ago","ctime":"April 15 2017, 15:15:44 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Your majesty and beauty","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/111222532487110249554","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Shawn Daniels","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4092589","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81706744&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"April 17 2017, 11:31:10 UTC","dname":"Shawn Daniels","ctime_ts":1492269344,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123926016/14202151","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26012898#t26012898","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26012898#t26012898","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26012898#t26012898","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dref22","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dref22.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26012898,"talkid":101612,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26012898#t26012898","upictitle":"Ms Dref: dref22","article":"It's the sci-fi show i've been waiting since BSG ended and i think i love it more than BSG.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 weeks ago","ctime":"April 15 2017, 18:49:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dref22.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dref22","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dref22","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dref22.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dref22","ctime_ts":1492282157,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26013410#t26013410","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26013410#t26013410","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26013410#t26013410","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"gman109","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26013410,"talkid":101614,"etime_ts":"1492310002","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/532962.html?thread=26013410#t26013410","upictitle":"gman109: pic#0","article":"What has surprised me is just how diverse the fan base is for this excellent new program.
