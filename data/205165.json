{"itemid":801,"subject":"Dark Sword Bonanza","event":"Dark Sword Miniatures have just rolled out five new figures in their Ice & Fire range, all sculpted by the incomparable Tom Meier.  I thought I'd give you guys a peek.\r\n\r\nFirst off we have Benjen Stark, younger brother of Lord Eddard, and First Ranger of the Night's Watch.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f80sy/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f80sy/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"466\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f9qfg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f9qfg/s640x480\" width=\"192\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext up is Bronn, sellsword, sometime companion to Chiggen, occasional henchman of a certain Imp of House Lannister.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fakp7/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fakp7\" width=\"105\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThen there's Young Robert: which is to say, Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, wielding his warhammer at the Battle of the Trident.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fb3f5/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fb3f5\" width=\"144\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext, Lady Lysa Arryn, sister to Catelyn and Edmure, wife to Jon Arryn, mother of Sweetrobin.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fc8ap/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fc8ap/s640x480\" width=\"388\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnd finally (for now), Maester Luwin, tutor, healer, and counselor to House Stark of Winterfell.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fd7gp/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fd7gp\" width=\"89\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhat you're seeing here are Tom's original sculpts, done in the sculpting medium called \"greenstuff.\"  When cast, all these miniatures will be in pewter, in 32mm scale.\r\n\r\nFor more information about these, and the rest of Dark Sword's figures, check out their website at http://darkswordminiatures.com/\r\n\r\nMore figures are already in the works, from both Tom Meier and Jeff Grace.","ditemid":205165,"eventtime":"2011-03-28 00:18:00","props":{"current_location":"at

The temple dates to the time of Vespasian and was in use for about 200 years. The Isis cult was one of those mystery cults popular with the Romans (like Mithras) and that figure surely suits a fertility goddess. ;)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 28 2011, 17:00:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://aulus-poliutos.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"aulus_poliutos","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"aulus_poliutos","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://aulus-poliutos.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"aulus_poliutos","ctime_ts":1301331641,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?replyto=12726893","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12726893#t12726893","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12726893#t12726893","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12726893#t12726893","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"allmenmustserve","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://allmenmustserve.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12726893,"talkid":49714,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12726893#t12726893","upictitle":"allmenmustserve: pic#96983937","article":"Now THAT is a warhammer.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 28 2011, 21:40:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://allmenmustserve.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"allmenmustserve","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"allmenmustserve","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://allmenmustserve.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"allmenmustserve","ctime_ts":1301348432,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/108788489/35561430","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?replyto=12727661","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12727661#t12727661","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12727661#t12727661","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12727661#t12727661","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_449760","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=551208283","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12727661,"talkid":49717,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12727661#t12727661","upictitle":"Skid Maher: pic#108788489","article":"Love them.

I must say that I wasn't even aware of these books, hell I had no idea of Volume Two, let alone Volume One.<br /><br />Well today I re-dressed that...though I live in a city of 4 million people (5.5 million if you count the metropolitan area), there only two freaking copies of Volume One available in the whole city and dozens upon dozens of bookstores. One of these two I now copies is  luckily in my posession and I have it by my side as I'm typing this comment. <br /><br />I loved your foreword Mr. Martin and I love the art contained within.  From Marc Simonetti's pieces which are really impressive, to John Howe's contributions, and Michael Kormack's  the works are outstanding...some of my favourite are \"Rose Gardens\" by Anders Finer and \"The Dothraki Sea\" by Eric Wilkerson.<br /><br />My copy of Volume Two is on order and will be in my hands soon, as for Volume One, I made  the employees at the bookstore sweat, because they had to look literally throughout the entire store to find this copy...<br /><br />These books should not be stuck in some storage room!!!!  They should be promoted more, especially now with the HBO series about to premiere!<br /><br />Sir, do you have any say in how these art books are marketed or is that up to the publisher?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 30 2011, 01:40:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The Art Of A Song Of Ice And Fire","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://loco73.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"loco73","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"loco73","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://loco73.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"loco73","ctime_ts":1301449222,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/107262947/33408870","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?replyto=12733037","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12733037#t12733037","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12733037#t12733037","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12733037#t12733037","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_381502","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/tripleneck","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12733037,"talkid":49738,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/205165.html?thread=12733037#t12733037","upictitle":"Robert Coleman: pic#107262947","article":"The new figures look great!
