{"itemid":1558,"subject":"Winning and Losing","event":"So the Jets won and the Giants lost, and this painful and depressing NFL season is finally over... for my teams, at least.\r\n\r\nThe Giants O looked terrific against the Eagles, right up until Eli threw that final fatal interception.&nbsp; Odell Beckham continues to look like a budding superstar, and Reuben Randall has started to make some great plays as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next year, with Victor Cruz back, the passing attack should be as dangerous as any in the league.&nbsp; But the running game still needs a lot of help.&nbsp; Might be that&#39;s more the O line than the RBs.&nbsp; And the defense... the defense could not stop the Eagles, and really, hasn&#39;t stopped anyone all season, which is a disgrace for a franchise with a proud history of defensive excellence.&nbsp; I&#39;d keep Tom Coughlin as head coach, and Ben McAdoo as offensive coordinator, but I think the G-Men need to replace Perry Fewell as defensive coordinator, and draft defense, defense, defense.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets, beating the Dolphins is always a nice way to end the season, though all the victory really did was move Gang Green lower in the draft.&nbsp; Geno Smith played the best game I have ever seen him play, aside from that one absolutely idiotic fumble.&nbsp; Even so, I do not believe he is the answer at QB, and I hope both he and Michael Vick are somebody else&#39;s problems next year.&nbsp; Tomorrow is Black Monday, wgen coaches and GMs are fired all over the league, and it is widely expected that the Jets will be cleaning house.&nbsp; I certainly hope they do give John Idzik his walking papers; his two years have been a disaster, and the team today is significantly less talented than when he came in.&nbsp; He started his tenure as GM by trading away Darrelle Revis, one of the team&#39;s best players and a cornerstone of Rex Ryan&#39;s defense, and it&#39;s pretty much been downhill from there.&nbsp; Idzik was a salary cap guy, just like Mike Tannenbaum, his predecessor.&nbsp; I really hope Woody does not make that mistake again.&nbsp; The Jets need a football guy in charge.\r\n\r\nAs for coach... if it was up to me, I&#39;d keep Rex Ryan.&nbsp; Defense wins championships, and Rex has proven himself one of the best defensive minds in the NFL.&nbsp; Give him some cornerbacks, and a quarterback and wideout who are at least adequate, and he can take you to the playoffs, as he proved his first two years.&nbsp; Even more crucially, though... if you fire Rex, who do you bring in?&nbsp; I don&#39;t see anyone out there who is going to be a sure-fired improvement.&nbsp; Change for the sake of change never gets you anywhere in the NFL.&nbsp; Unless the Jets have a better coach than Rex in their pocket, firing him would be a big mistake.\r\n\r\nBut these are the Jets, and big mistakes are standard operating procedure, so watch... Rex will get fired tomorrow.\r\n&nbsp;","ditemid":398882,"eventtime":"2014-12-29 00:51:00","props":{"current_mood":"numb","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":124,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1419878413,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Winning and Losing http://j.mp/1vlOAD2","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.679233263949721]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1419839538}","revtime":1419881554},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-12-29 07:51:18","anum":34,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398882.html","event_timestamp":1419814260,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121411156/65344279","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398882.html?thread=20011554#t20011554","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398882.html?thread=20011554#t20011554","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398882.html?thread=20011554#t20011554","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2058420","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20011554,"talkid":78170,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/398882.html?thread=20011554#t20011554","upictitle":"GeekFurious: pic#121411156","article":"I think where the Giants need to focus their off-season energy is in the O and D lines.

Defense is the priority, but that O-line still needs some tinkering.  If Justin Pugh is the longterm RT, they need to upgrade at Guard (or vise versa) so that Weston Richburg can move to center.  John Jerry is nothing more than a stopgap.  But with Geoff Scwartz back next year, one more piece can finally solidify the line.  And I do think they need something else at RB--Jennings is good but is old and can't be trusted to stay healthy, while Andre Williams can't be trusted to provide steady production each week.  He's more of a role player.  So one more RB to shore up the depth here.  Otherwise it's as you say--defense, defense, defense.<br /><br />I also agree with you about keeping Coughlin and McAdoo, and parting ways with Perry Fewell, and wouldn't mind Tom Quinn getting the boot as well.
