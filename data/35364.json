{"itemid":138,"subject":"Dark Sword Miniatures","event":"<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00003rth/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00003rth/s320x240\" width=\"250\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe first wave of Ice and Fire figures from Dark Sword Miniatures have been very well received, I am pleased to report.  If you missed those, you can check them out on Dark Sword's own website at http://darkswordminiatures.com/  \r\n\r\nHere's a couple of painted versions that I thought were especially stunning -- the Lannister twins, with Cersei in red and Jaime in his Kingsguard whites, rendered by the talented brush of Marike Reimer.  Beautiful work, I think.  The way she does face is amazing.  (I paint minis myself from time to time for relaxation, but at this scale, I count it a success if both eyes don't end up on the same side of the nose).\r\n\r\nWith the first wave of minis meeting such a great reception, Dark Sword and Tom Meier are gearing up for wave # 2.  Once again the set will consist of ten figures:  six named characters from A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, and four \"types,\" spearcarriers or soldiers of one faction or another, intended to fill out the ranks.\r\n\r\nTwo of the \"named character\" slots have already been filled.  Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, and Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, will both be part of the next release.  As for the four remaining figures... that's where you guys come in.  We're going to do a poll.  We'll give you ten options, and the top four finishers will be part of Dark Sword's \"second wave.\"\r\n\r\nBut more on that next post.","ditemid":35364,"eventtime":"2008-02-12 17:18:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":254,"taglist":"miniatures, dark sword","commentalter":1203256634,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-13 01:14:06","anum":36,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html","event_timestamp":1202836680,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/12221551/751873","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?replyto=3453732","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453732#t3453732","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453732#t3453732","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453732#t3453732","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"elegantelbow","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://elegantelbow.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3453732,"talkid":13491,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453732#t3453732","upictitle":"elegantelbow: purple icon","article":"Gorgeous!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 13 2008, 01:15:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://elegantelbow.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"elegantelbow","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"elegantelbow","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://elegantelbow.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"elegantelbow","ctime_ts":1202865334,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/29602340/1965455","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?replyto=3453988","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453988#t3453988","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453988#t3453988","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453988#t3453988","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"baine_darkwolf","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://baine-darkwolf.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3453988,"talkid":13492,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/35364.html?thread=3453988#t3453988","upictitle":"Baine Wolfheart: stark","article":"Wow the paint job on Jaime is beautiful.

You can hire Marike herself, who did the minis shown, but work of that quality will cost you.  Other good services that I've used in my past myself include Pigmented Miniatures, WarPaint, Pictor Studios, Blue Table Painting.  Many offer a range of styles, with the less detailed ones costing less.<br /><br />There's also an outfit named Fernando Enterprises in Sri Lanka, where they will paint for miniatures very inexpensively... and, for the price, the quality is not half bad.
