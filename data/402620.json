{"itemid":1572,"subject":"Locker Room Shuffle","event":"So the Buffalo Bills have hired Rex Ryan as their new coach, and my New York Jets have hired Todd Bowles, formerly the defensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals.\r\n\r\nRyan&#39;s opening press conference with the Bills was very impressive.&nbsp; He seemed to be the old Rex again, brimming with confidence and swagger, all leavened with a healthy sense of humor.&nbsp; He promised to make the Bills a &quot;bully,&quot; a team that no one will want to play.&nbsp; I believe him.\r\n\r\nI have not seen Bowles address the media yet.&nbsp; Must admit, I don&#39;t know much about him.&nbsp; He has a good resume, and from what I hear, a very different persona than Rex.&nbsp; They are both defensive coaches, but Rex is a so-called player&#39;s coach while Bowles is a disciplinarian.&nbsp; Which might be great if the Jets suffered from a lack of discipline, but I really don&#39;t think that was their problem.&nbsp; It was lack of talent, especially at the quarterback position, that doomed Gang Green.\r\n\r\nRyan and Bowles both face the same problem: neither the Bills nor the Jets has a NFL-calibre starting quarterback, in a league where you really need a star at that position.&nbsp; Buffalo got by last year with journeyman Kyle Orton, who has since retired, leaving them only with E.J. Manuel.&nbsp; The Jets have Geno Smith.&nbsp; Manuel and Smith were both high drafts picks, and both appear to be busts.&nbsp; Backing up Smith, the Jets have the aging Michael Vick.&nbsp; The Bills... I have no idea, actually.\r\n\r\nUnless Marcus Mariota falls to sixth in the draft, or the Jets pick up a new quarterback in free agency, I fear they are going to have another very bad year in 2015.&nbsp; Neither Geno Smith nor Michael Vick is the answer.&nbsp; And Rex may not fare much better in Buffalo.\r\n\r\nBut both teams should have hellancious defenses.&nbsp; Maybe they will play a couple of 0-0 ties next season.","ditemid":402620,"eventtime":"2015-01-15 13:07:00","props":{"current_mood":"apathetic","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":114,"commentalter":1421823160,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Locker Room Shuffle http://j.mp/1KOcGRO","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.680047932086167]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1421352466}","revtime":1421872376},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-01-15 20:07:11","anum":188,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html","event_timestamp":1421327220,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124482509/73944396","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20103356#t20103356","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20103356#t20103356","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20103356#t20103356","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2965723","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RyanPicklesimer","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20103356,"talkid":78528,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20103356#t20103356","upictitle":"Ryan Picklesimer: pic#124482509","article":"Are you a fan of college football at all?

The press conferences.  (He is sour and humorless, in contrast to Rex, who always showed a lot of humanity).  The way he ran up the score those seasons when the pats were dominant.  The nasty way he treated Eric Mangini when EM left the Pats to coach the Jets. The cold-blooded way he dumps his veteran players, even ones who have bled and fought for him for years.  (Yeah, I know, it's business.  It's still lousy). <br /><br />All that is minor compared to his one-day tenure as Jets HC, however.  It was not just that he left, but the WAY he did it.

If he was going to break his word and jump ship, at least he should have returned the million dollars.

A lot of speculation going around that he's ultimately set himself up for failure given all the question marks surrounding the Bills QB situation right now, and if the Bills don't reach the playoffs within the next 3-4 years (MAX), I fear we can expect to see a second pink slip for him in just a decade's time.<br /><br />With that said, the overall success of the Bills is not really my concern, but I'm interesting to hear what other Rex and/or Bills fans think of the situation....Can he continue his legacy in Buffalo as the ultimate \"player's-coach\" and finally lead the Bills to playoff berth, or will the current lack of an offense lead to his utter demise?<br /><br />But most importantly...Who else thinks he can AND will persuade Revis to join him for the second coming?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 15 2015, 21:58:14 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://drogonbeatsmaug.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"drogonbeatsmaug","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"drogonbeatsmaug","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://drogonbeatsmaug.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"January 15 2015, 22:20:11 UTC","dname":"drogonbeatsmaug","ctime_ts":1421359094,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107196#t20107196","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107196#t20107196","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107196#t20107196","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2965923","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/104636943572056645903","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20107196,"talkid":78543,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107196#t20107196","upictitle":"Jim Myers: pic#0","article":"As a Bills fan I'm pretty excited about Rex. Of course the sorry pack of coaches we've endured this century included Wade Phillips, Dick Jauron, Chan Gailey and Benedict Marrone so basically any proven head coach who shows signs of having a pulse on the sideline looks good by comparison. But our playoff drought is so large now it has become a dark cloud over the team's psyche and Rex is exactly the kind of coach that can snap the funk and convince them WE WILL go to the playoffs. Plus handing him our defense is like handing Rembrandt a canvas and some paint. Rex will still have to improve on his game managment flaws and stop picking terrible OCs (unsure if Greg Roman will work out or not). Whiffing on drafting a quarterback traditionally takes 5 years to recover from and we're only in Year 3, with no promising solution in sight.  We could still panic and fall into the one of the dual pit traps of signing Jay Cutler or signing Mark Sanchez. But still, I'm pretty excited.<br /><br />I think Bowles will be good for your Jets, at least based on his defensive play calling ability.  Cards had a million injuries and a laughable QB situation and still played great defense.  I admit I was sort of hoping Doug Marrone would become your coach, partly because of the extra drama that would add to Jets-Bills games and partly because two teams missing the playoffs and then swapping coaches would be the most non-Patriots AFC East thing to do ever.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 15 2015, 22:40:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/104636943572056645903","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jim Myers","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2965923","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73945630&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jim Myers","ctime_ts":1421361638,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123903486/72071300","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107452#t20107452","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107452#t20107452","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107452#t20107452","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2738803","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/OberynMattell","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20107452,"talkid":78544,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402620.html?thread=20107452#t20107452","upictitle":"Oberyn Mattell: pic#123903486","article":"The Bowles hire just doesn't move the meter at all for me.
