{"itemid":168,"subject":"Center Stage","event":"Here's your chance to ask me that question you've always wanted an answer to.\r\n\r\nStarting tomorrow, I will be appearing for the next five days on the Center Stage forum of the Barnes & Noble Book Club.  I'll be logging on at least once each day to field whatever questions my readers and the B&N customers have left for me.  Now, I'm not going to promise to answer all of the questions.  I will give it my best college try, but a lot depends on how many questions are actually posted.  Sometimes this blog generates hundreds of comments in just a few hours, and that's obviously more than I can handle... but if the number is more manageable, well, I'll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nYou'll find Center Stage at http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/bn/board?board.id=CenterStage if you would like to post a question, or just read the ongoing discussions.\r\n\r\nI will actually have three topics for my very own.  One for INSIDE STRAIGHT and the Wild Card series, one for A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE and all my other books, and one about my experiences writing for television and film, including BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, TWILIGHT ZONE, and my series-that-never-was, DOORWAYS.  So be sure to post your question in the right topic.","ditemid":43209,"eventtime":"2008-04-13 23:51:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":228,"commentalter":1210336974,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-04-14 06:13:34","anum":201,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43209.html","event_timestamp":1208130660,"reply_count":45,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/59181648/6984327","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43209.html?replyto=3818697","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43209.html?thread=3818697#t3818697","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43209.html?thread=3818697#t3818697","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43209.html?thread=3818697#t3818697","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grayshifter","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grayshifter.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3818697,"talkid":14916,"etime_ts":"1208155363","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/43209.html?thread=3818697#t3818697","upictitle":"grayshifter: meow cat kitty","article":"EDIT: I just realized you were talking about the forum and not this blog entry, but I'll leave my comment anyway in quiet hope.

It's just that I've gotten use to immediately recognizing the many characters by the voice inflections Roy gives them. I recognize the characters before Roy reads that this is Tyrion speaking or Arya speaking.  John Lee just does not have much distinction between the many different characters.  John is a good reader, but Roy is superb, a one in ten thousand reader. I hope you will consider using Roy for the last two books of the series.  Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.  Needless to say, I love your writting.  You are a fantastic writer!

To just let it come to some peaceful part so we can get onto another character without feeling torn to bits inside? Every time?<br /><br />And could you just threaten Croatian translator to stop translating names of the places in the books? Please?<br />Because kids these days in Croatia have no idea that Winterfell is called Winterfell... they think its called something like Sharp winter(ish)... translated back to English.
