{"itemid":7,"subject":"Tiki! Tiki!! Tiki!!!","event":"I love Tiki Barber.\r\n\r\nI have been watching football for going on fifty years now, and I don't think I've ever seen a better performance by a running back than the one that Tiki put on against the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday.  It was just extraordinary.  I've watched his long forty-one yard touchdown run a dozen times (I love Tivo too), often in slow motion, and I still can't believe it.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it even better is that Tiki seems to be such a great team guy.  Sort of the anti Terrell Owens.  Unselfish, courageous, intelligent, self-effacing.  One could even say gallant.\r\n\r\nThe Giants have had some great running backs over the years.  Rodney Hampton, O.J. Anderson, Dave Meggett, Little Joe Morris, and others who came before my time.  But Tiki is the greatest of them all, I think.","ditemid":1808,"eventtime":"2005-12-18 15:40:00","props":{"commentalter":1158424947,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2005-12-18 22:47:35","anum":16,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1808.html","event_timestamp":1134920400,"reply_count":2,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1808.html?replyto=120080","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1808.html?thread=120080#t120080","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1808.html?thread=120080#t120080","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1808.html?thread=120080#t120080","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":120080,"talkid":469,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1808.html?thread=120080#t120080","article":"I just want to say that my respect for you has risen a thousand fold.
