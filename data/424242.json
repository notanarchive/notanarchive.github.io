{"itemid":1657,"subject":"Schubert Withdraws","event":"Edmund R. Schubert, the editor of ORSON SCOTT CARD'S INTERGALACTIC MEDICINE SHOW, has announced his decision to withdraw from the Hugo race.  Schubert was a nominee in the category Best Editor, Short Form.  He had been included on both the Sad Puppy and Rabid Puppy slates, though apparently without his knowledge.\r\n\r\nHe has issued a statement explaining the reasons for his withdrawal, which you can read here:\r\nhttp://aletheakontis.com/2015/04/in-which-edmund-schubert-withdraws-from-the-hugos/\r\n\r\nSasquan had previously announced that the Hugo ballot in now at the printers, so Schubert's name will still appear, but he has indicated that he will refuse the award, should he win it.\r\n\r\nI understand the reasons for his withdrawal and applaud his integrity.  It cannot be easy to walk away from a major award, perhaps one that you have dreamed of someday winning.  And this takes courage as well; like the others who have dropped off the Puppy slate, he will undoubtedly come in for a certain amount of angry barking from the kennels.","ditemid":424242,"eventtime":"2015-04-28 16:14:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1430503153,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Schubert Withdraws http://goo.gl/J6M6bv","picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.678340272690709]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430259235}","revtime":1430720182},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-28 22:13:51","anum":50,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html","event_timestamp":1430237640,"reply_count":35,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51241774/1900775","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21520690#t21520690","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21520690#t21520690","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21520690#t21520690","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"murasaki_1966","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://murasaki-1966.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21520690,"talkid":84065,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21520690#t21520690","upictitle":"murasaki_1966: Murasaki","article":"Does this mean he'll have time to finish that damned symphony?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 28 2015, 23:29:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://murasaki-1966.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"murasaki_1966","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"murasaki_1966","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://murasaki-1966.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"murasaki_1966","ctime_ts":1430263771,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/118708656/52215727","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21521458#t21521458","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21521458#t21521458","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21521458#t21521458","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21521458#t21521458","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1386268","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/devdeep1987","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21521458,"talkid":84068,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21521458#t21521458","upictitle":"Devdeep Roy Choudhury: pic#118708656","article":"Mr. Martin, in one of your previous posts(Fanageddon), you pointed out that everyone needs to vote.

I know; I've been seeing them say for years now how awful and exclusionary it is that anyone has to pay anything at all to vote, and that $40 is Major Money.<br /><br />As it happens, I agree that the current year's WSFS membership dues ($40 minimum; it will be $50 next year) isn't a huge sum of money to me, but then, I'm a reasonably well-off professional. To a lot of people who care about SF/F, it's Big Bucks. This is, however, not a resolvable issue because it's totally subjective.<br /><br />If someone wants to create The Award From Every Consumer of SF/F Popular Culture Anywhere In The World, nobody is stopping them; however, don't expect Worldcon members to do it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 30 2015, 16:15:01 UTC","parent":21541682,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kevin_standlee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kevin_standlee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kevin_standlee","ctime_ts":1430410501,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/118843176/52559041","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21532722#t21532722","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21532722#t21532722","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21532722#t21532722","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1407911","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/stevie.gamble.9","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21532722,"talkid":84112,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424242.html?thread=21532722#t21532722","upictitle":"Stevie Gamble: pic#118843176","article":"Yes; not telling him in advance was a cruel thing to do, and I greatly admire the dignity with which Edmund Schubert has responded. I am half way through the sampler he has put together, and recommend it to others; there's some excellent stuff in there. <br /><br />I do feel that cruelty has become so prevalent that it isn't even noticed in Puppy World; it's as if everyone is disposable if it gives Brad, Larry and Vox what they want. And now Vox has turned on Brad and Larry, who are discovering that they too are disposable. There may be a degree of poetic justice involved, but it is far easier to break something than to make it.

At NASFIC 2010 his books (IGMS anthologies among other things) and my \"stuff\" shared a table in the dealer's room. He was generous with his time, advice, and friendship. I've been honored to call him a colleague, and occasionally enjoyed very much my time with him on sf con panels -- one that very much sticks out in light of all the recent goings on is, at illogiCon 2013? or 2014?, a panel on -- get this! -- civil discourse in sf, considering the wide range of political, religious, and other beliefs. Ed of course had some wonderful things to say on that score.<br /><br />One of my favorite \"Ed\" moments though has to be his conversation with you at ConCarolinas last year. A huge packed hall, great, far-ranging conversation on books and fandom and on and on.<br /><br />I can't really imagine what Ed has to have gone through this year. Mr. Swanwick likely said it best: \"Imagine dedicating your life to science fiction. Then imagine being nominated for the Hugo for the very first time. Now imagine turning down the honor.\" And: \"Edmund, I hope that if I ever find myself in your situation, I show your grace.\"","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 1 2015, 14:01:01 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The truly wonderful Mr. Schubert","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mb-s.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mb_s","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mb_s","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mb-s.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mb_s","ctime_ts":1430488861,"tracked":0}]}
