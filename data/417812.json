{"itemid":1632,"subject":"Blogging for Rockets","event":"The Sad Puppies and their supporters have argued that they are not the first to campaign for awards in our (not so) little genre.\r\n\r\nThey're right about that, of course.\r\n\r\nI've been around a long time.  So has campaigning, by one means or another.\r\n\r\nThe Nebulas were even more vulnerable to this than the Hugos, because the pool of voters is so much smaller.  Once upon a time, you could see the log-rolling clearly, because the Nebula Awards Reports published the <b>names</b> of the members recommending a story beside the recommendation.  You only had to look at the latest NAR to note, \"oh, Bill has nominated Ted, and Ted and nominated Bill, and both of them have nominated Alice,\" or, \"hmmmm, gee, all these guys from Alabama, they're in the same writer's group and they are all nominating each other.\"  \r\n\r\nThing is, though, it didn't really hurt.  It all balanced out.  And besides, it might have been above board.  It's only human for friends to read the work of friends and be predisposed to like it.  Maybe there was vote-swapping going on and maybe there wasn't.  No way to prove it.  It did bother me, however, when a certain segment of the membership demanded that the NAR stop listing the names.  I suspect the same thing went on as before, only now it was hidden from sight.\r\n\r\n(Oh, and lest I be accused of hypocrisy, my own stories were often recommended during those years, and sometimes by friends.  And sometimes I recommended their stories.  As I said, it's normal and human to read and enjoy the work of people you know and like).  \r\n\r\nIf the campaigning had ended there, it might have been fine.  But things got worse.  One year, there was a certain well regarded new writer who had a big novella in one of the magazines.  He had never done a book before... but a major publisher had just signed him to a multi-book contract that would include his first novel.  Well, the magazine and the book publisher got together for a mass \"for your consideration\" mailing.  The magazine supplied copies, the book publisher mailed them out, and every member of SFWA got a copy of his novella.  Needless to say, he won the Nebula in a walk... and when that first novel came out, it had NEBULA AWARD WINNER proudly displayed across its covers.  \r\n\r\nOnly one writer has ever refused a Nebula.  That was my friend and sometime collaborator Lisa Tuttle, who won the 1982 Nebula for her story \"The Bone Flute,\" and declined it... to protest the rising tide of Nebula campaigning.  I love Lisa and I love her writing, but I said then and I say now, that was an odd decision.  After all, it wasn't Lisa who'd been campaigning.  In fact,  her story had WON over the guy who did the campaign (he had mailed out copies of his own story to the Nebula voters).  Last I heard, Lisa's Nebula was in David Hartwell's house, serving as a bookend.  She still doesn't want it.  I wish I could say that her grand gesture did some good, and shamed the members of SFWA to stop campaigning... but alas, nothing of the sort.  \r\n\r\nAnd what about the Hugos, you ask?\r\n\r\nYeah, there too.  In the ongoing discussion of Puppygate, numerous people have cited one instance, wherein a stack of identical nominating ballots arrived with the same postmark, paid for by consecutive money orders.  Those were disallowed.  In 1987, members of the Church of Scientology campaigned successfully to place L. Ron Hubbard's BLACK GENESIS on the Best Novel ballot.  That was not disallowed -- the Scientologists had done nothing illegal, after all, all they'd done is buy supporting memberships to a convention that they had no intention of attending, for the sole purpose of nominating LRH for a Hugo (hmmm, why does that tactic sound familiar?) -- but their campaign created a huge backlash.  Hubbard's name was booed lustily at the Hugo ceremony in Brighton, and his book finished last in the final balloting, behind No Award.  (The winner that year was Orson Scott Card, with SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, for those who are counting).\r\n\r\nOf course, there were also recommended reading lists.  That wasn't campaigning, not strictly, but certain lists could have huge influence on the final ballot.  The annual LOCUS Recommended Reading List, compiled by Charles Brown and his staff and reviewers, was the most influential.  If your book or story made that list... well, it did not guarantee you a place on the ballot, but it sure improved your chances.  NESFA (the New England fan club) had an annual list as well, and LASFS might have done the same, not sure.  And of course the Nebulas, which came before the Hugos, carried a lot of weight too.  Win a Nebula, and the chances were good that you'd be a Hugo nominee as well.  Again, no guarantee, some years the shortlists diverged sharply... but more often than not, there was a lot of overlap.\r\n\r\nSo there were always these factors in play.  Cliques, I can hear the Sad Puppies saying.  Yeah, maybe.  Thing is, they were COMPETING cliques.  The NESFA list and the Nebula list were not the same, and the LOCUS list... the LOCUS list was always very long.  Five spots on the Hugo ballot, and LOCUS would recommend twenty books, or thirty... sometimes more, when they started putting SF and fantasy in separate categories.  \r\n\r\nBottom line, lots of people influenced the Hugos (or tried to), but no one ever successfully <i><b>controlled</b></i> the Hugos.  \r\n\r\nThat became even more true when we entered the age of the internet.  Suddenly blogs and bulletin boards and listservs were everywhere, and there were DOZENS of people drawing up recommended reading lists and suggesting books and writers and stories.  Sweet chaos.  It was glorious.  So many people talking about books, arguing about books, reading books.\r\n\r\nThat was also when the practice of writers blogging about their own eligible books and stories took root.  \"Say, the Hugo nominations are coming up, and I had a few things out last year.  Hey, check them out.\"  Some people were deeply offended by this practice.  (Some still are.  Check out the blogs of Peter Watts and Adam Roberts on the subject, for instance).  Others, especially newer writers and those hungry for attention, seized on it at once as a way of getting their name out there.  Publishers and editors began to encourage it.  Publicity and advertising budgets being what they were (non-existent in many cases), new writers and midlist writers soon realized that if they did not publicize their books, no one would.  \r\n\r\nAnd once it really got rolling, there was no stopping it.  \"Everyone else is doing it,\" you heard writers say.  \"I have to do it, in self-defense.\"  They were not wrong.  Sometimes the difference between making the Hugo ballot and falling short <b><i>is a single vote</i></b>.  The writer who refused to self-promote and then fell a few votes short... ouch.\r\n\r\n[And yes, I have done all this myself.  Mentioned my own work, drawn up recommended reading lists, blogged passionately about people I thought deserved a nomination.  I am not condemning the practice, just reporting on it.  It always made me feel awkward, but like many of my friends, I knew that if I refrained and then missed the ballot by a few votes, I would be kicking myself.  I'd sooner see the practice die out.  But until it does, you have to play the game.]\r\n\r\nOf course, not everyone was equally good at self-promotion.  Certain subfandoms were better organized than others (the DOCTOR WHO fans, for instance).  Certain writers were more skilled at social media than others, and built up huge personal followings on Twitter and Facebook, or through their blogs... numbers that soon translated to multiple Hugo nominations.  \r\n\r\nAnd that was pretty much where we stood, until the Sad Puppies came along.\r\n\r\nI have very mixed feelings about campaigning for awards.  Part of me agrees with my friend Lisa Tuttle.  Wouldn't it be great if each reader could make his own nominations, without being influenced by slates or lists or mass mailings?  It would also be great if all the children of the world could get together and sing in perfect harmony, but that's not going to happen either.  Like it or not, campaigning is here to stay.  \r\n\r\nI can see where this is going.  I am a Worldcon member and a SFWA member, but I am also a member of the Writer's Guild of America and the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which means I vote on the WGA awards and the Emmys... and so the flood comes in, DVDs and Blu-Rays and screeners and links to lockboxes, all full of TV shows and movies \"for my consideration.\"  Way too many to watch.  Way too many to count.  Are there studios and directors and networks that don't play the game, that don't send out screeners and run ads in VARIETY and THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER.  Sure there are.  They are easy to recognize.  They're the studios and directors and networks who don't win any awards.\r\n\r\nOnce you let the genie out of the bottle, he doesn't go back in.\r\n\r\nThe Sad Puppies did not invent Hugo campaigning, by any means.  But they escalated it, just as that magazine/publisher partnership did way back when.  They turned it up to eleven.  Their slate was more effective that anyone could ever have dreamed, so effective that they drowned out pretty much all the other voices.  They ran the best organized, most focused, and most effective awards campaign in the history of our genre, and showed everyone else how it's done.\r\n\r\nThe lesson will be learned.  The Sad Puppies have already announced that they intend to do it again next year.  Which means that other factions in fandom will have to do it as well.  Just as happened with the \"let me tell you about my eligible works,\" the rest of the field is going to need to field slates of their own in self-defense.\r\n\r\nI don't look forward to that.  It cheapens the Hugos.  Will future winners actually be the best books or stories?  Or only the books and stories that ran the best campaigns?\r\n\r\nCan all the king's horses and all the king's men put the Hugos back together again?\r\n\r\nI don't see how.  And that makes me sadder than all those puppies put together.","ditemid":417812,"eventtime":"2015-04-09 02:46:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, nebula awards","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1428877112,"crosspost_tw":" Blogging for Rockets http://j.mp/1aoOLuk","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"hugo","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.685956939772388]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428569181}","revtime":1429077282},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-09 08:45:53","anum":20,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html","event_timestamp":1428547560,"reply_count":201,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/99793990/25746361","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20648468#t20648468","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20648468#t20648468","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20648468#t20648468","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20648468#t20648468","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dothraki","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dothraki.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20648468,"talkid":80658,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20648468#t20648468","article":"There is something I've been wondering about with respect to Hugo voting this year.

There's a running trend particularly noticable in the Oscars, of the whole \"campaigning\" aspect. I watch the Oscars ceremony every year, last year I had even managed to see all the best picture nominees on the big screen. I agreed with some wins, objected to some omissions and had a grand discussion of the same with my flatmate afterwards. While I love having the discussion about noiminees and winners every year, I hold very little regard for the process for picking the best exampels for each category, because in the back of my head I believe they only won because they campaigned the most, or most effectively.<br /><br />I love the idea that the Hugos were founded on, it seemed to be a great format for a popular vote by real fans for the works they thought were most deserving. As you pointed out, those were the days you had to post around copies of your work to get it considered, and the idea of \"slates\" like the sad puppies campaign were still possible, but much more difficult to implement. I also believe that the widespread idea of \"trolling\" or excessive political or ideological stances in a decidedly non-political arena such as some SF Literary awards would have been laughable or considered appalling by many. I don't see anyway around these, in the age of the internet, and I don't know if it would even be possible to attempt a fair awards system that is exclusive to the \"real\" fans. <br /><br />I feel sad for you (and many other writers and SF fans), as I know from the last few years and your post yesterday that the Hugos mean so very much to you and are a great part of your life as a young author, but perhaps you and many of your peers may have to start preparing to let go of those hopes for a return to the old days. It is not a positive outlook, but I feel it may be the most realistic, and perhaps you may be able to form your own awards, with your own screening criteria and rules about campaigning. I'd certainly respect the results from that, if I felt it was managed correctly.

So yes, the lists are already skewed in the Sad/Rabid Puppies' favor, but it's still possible to affect the winners.  I don't believe that a majority of people will opt for the nuclear option, but I can only hope that a majority actually take the time to, you know, actually read the nominated books and stories.  Surely there will be some hierarchy that can be imposed, and if the voter truly believes there is a more deserving (and I know this is strictly subjective) but un-nominated tale, then the No Award should be used.<br /><br />George mentioned sour grapes before, and for the most part, that's the situation now.  The Puppies played the system, thereby showing its weakness.  Plenty of people don't agree with how this year's nominations came about, but it is now locked in.  Perhaps in the future write-in votes would be accepted to counterbalance nominations dominated by any group's slate.  Until then, we must make the best of it, in the most forthright way possible.

But once the attackers are too many and the father realize there is no way he can save his still unborn offspring, he joins the egg thieves and tries to eat as many of his own eggs as fast as he can. If you can't win, you either join them or you don't. The same thing happened with the passenger pigeon. Once the populations had become so small that the hunters understood there was a risk that the bird could be gone forever, the hunting intensified more than ever, turning the worries into a self fulfilling prophesy. It's the same in the stock market and business in general, or award procedures. When everybody else is doing it one is often forced to join them, and the only was for them to stop is that someone on the outside with some influence put their foot down. Who knows, maybe most of those involved are actually grateful for it. <br /><br />Orson Scott Card was once a Hugo winner. Would he be a winner today? I suspect a nomination would have resulted in a similar campaign as with the Ender's Game movie. Geeks OUT! and petition and bloggers and forum trolls all worked together to prevent people from seeing the movie. Because they did not agree with the writer's personal opinions, and came up with all kinds of stories they hoped would convince people. This would not have been possible without internet. And the movie was not a success, which did not hurt the author so much but did hurt the producers and others who had invested a lot of money in a movie that had nothing to do with gay people at all. It's hard to say if it was because of the campaign or for some other reason. But all the trouble around it could have made theatre owners nervous and forced them to play safe. Where I live the movie was only shown a single week, practically no promotion, once a day at 21.00 in the evening and on the smallest screen in the theatre. Of course if wouldn't make much money that way. In comparison other potentially big movies are shown for weeks, many times a day on several different screens. <br /> <br />If the future of the Hugo is not about which book is the best, but which books the most fanatic online activists feels deserve or not deserve to win, it's not good news for talented writers that are newcomers and still relatively unknown.

It's a tempting \"fix,\" but I worry a bit about some future year in which the next \"new wave\" of geniuses crashes upon the SF shores and attracts a bunch of very similar, but uncoordinated, nominations.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 9 2015, 12:23:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Change the rules to ban slates?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jpomeranz.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jpomeranz","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jpomeranz","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jpomeranz.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jpomeranz","ctime_ts":1428582227,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681236#t20681236","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681236#t20681236","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681236#t20681236","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681236#t20681236","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20681236,"talkid":80786,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681236#t20681236","above":20659476,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Voters who wanted to influence the process without adopting one slate could pick from the best of several.<br /><br />We could end up with a ballot that contains some picks from slates, some works with crossover appeal to multiple slates and others that got there from individual support.

Perhaps this needed to happen so the promise in that assertion is kept; diversity of opinion is just as if not more relevant than skin-deep differences in the process of inclusion.<br /><br />It would befit some of the literati, like Mr. Scalzi, to learn of it.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 9 2015, 13:00:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Slate Voting","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://asombreroman.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"asombreroman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"asombreroman","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://asombreroman.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"asombreroman","ctime_ts":1428584402,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681748#t20681748","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681748#t20681748","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681748#t20681748","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681748#t20681748","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20681748,"talkid":80788,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/417812.html?thread=20681748#t20681748","above":20662548,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Their blogs come to me daily on an RSS feed I have curated to include them.

I don't see this as campaigning at all, but clarifying information \"for the choir\".<br /><br />These followed blogs are not the only way I find out about books -- word of mouth and browsing are still taking place. And I have no problem nomming a work that has blown me away by someone new to me. I am not limiting myself to info on followed blogs.
