{"itemid":245,"subject":"Charge Up the Paddles, the Jets Are Playing","event":"Why must the Jets stop my heart beating every time they play a game?\r\n\r\nTheir season almost ended today with a horrendous loss to the Buffalo Bills.  Then the football gods and Buffalo coach Dick Jauron give us an early Christmas present.  Only seconds from the two minute warning, the Bills had the lead and the ball on a second-and-five.  All they had to do was run out the clock and make the Jets burn their timeouts, and the game was over.  The Jets had been unable to stop Bills RB Marshawn Lynch all day.  So what does Buffalo do?  They call a rollout play-action pass.  Then comes a sack and a fumble, Jets recover, Sean Ellis runs it in for a TD and a miraculous victory.  I am tempted to say the Jets snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, but really, it was the Bills who snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.  Bad play by Losman, worse call by the Bills coaches.  \r\n\r\nIt was the second huge freak play that turned the game.  Back in the first quarter, the Jets were dominating.  Up 14-3 and driving past midfield for a third score.  Then a Favre pass bounces off the hands of Coles, off a Bills defender, off Coles' foot, and into the hands of a second Bills defender.  And suddenly all the momentum shifts.  Very shortly thereafter, the Bills score and are right back in the game.  It's amazing how fast a football game can shift, but that's why I love the sport.\r\n\r\nI still don't feel good about the Jets' chances.  They won, but they did not play well, and that season ending game against Miami looms large on the schedule.  The whole situation smells as if it's set up for a Hollywood ending, called \"Chad's Revenge.\"  And right now Pennington and the Fish are playing much better football than Brett and the Jets.\r\n\r\nThe Giants came is tonight.  Let's see how they do against the quarrelin' Cowboys.","ditemid":62886,"eventtime":"2008-12-14 15:44:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":342,"current_moodid":28,"commentalter":1229881907,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-12-14 22:56:47","anum":166,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/62886.html","event_timestamp":1229269440,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/62886.html?replyto=4823974","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/62886.html?thread=4823974#t4823974","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/62886.html?thread=4823974#t4823974","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/62886.html?thread=4823974#t4823974","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4823974,"talkid":18843,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/62886.html?thread=4823974#t4823974","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"They actually featured the Jets game here on one of the sports channels in Sweden, so I watched most of it.
