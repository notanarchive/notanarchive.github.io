Eventually, in a fit of madness, Tonias decided to ride in a tourney of no note against untested squires in order to insure a victory only to be unhorsed right away and break his back in the process... Unable to deal with the shame of being unhorsed in a squires tourney and left a cripple he left the crown on the iron thrown and vanished in the night. This is where the Young Dragon, without a moment of hesitation picked up both crown and sword and defended the honor of the Royal House on the very same day he was made King against a decorated champion of renown from House Manning and fought to a near draw in a tilt that saw 20 lances broken before a victor declared. Over the next 2 weeks the young dragon Dak The Doubtful proved himself quelling an uprising in the East against the Hated Redskins and returned home and repelled an assault on the Capital by the Treacherous Bears of House Bolton. This story is yet to be completed. But the Young Dragon an Unlikely Ruler has carried his House back to Honor and made our enemies suffer through fire and blood! Is he the Prince that was promised? Or will Tonias return from his self exile to take back the crown and lead the \"S-Targarayen\" armies to victory. You will have to wait for the next book to come out to find out. \"Wins in the Winter\" is rumored to be released tomorrow on 394 publications along with an Algerian Amazon Barcode showing an October Release date but Unheralded Author and Lifelong GRRM supporter Caleb H had this to say, \"it will be done when it's done\" and \"Look, this is a complex Book about a Complex Organization with Multiple Main Characters like the Old Dragon Jerriah Targarayen (jerry jones) The Maester Of StarRise but 100's of minor characters that weave intricate plot lines throughout the book and have in some cases large parts to play in the outcome. Plus the back stories and history in a world like this is so difficult to write and keep track of. Such as Emmitius Smith the Small Dragon, Troyu The Conqueror who conquered the Known World 3 times! Be patient when it's done I will let you know until then don't believe what you read\"! <br /><br />A little Humor with my football love! Hope not offended My Liege King George!
