{"itemid":1326,"subject":"Hot Night on Montezuma","event":"The Neil and Amanda Show last Sunday night was a great success.&nbsp; (Sorry if you missed it).\r\n\r\nNeil Gaiman read stories, Amanda Palmer sang her hits and played her ukelele, and from time to time the they did duets.&nbsp; They opened the night with a memorable version of &quot;Makin&#39; Whoopee&quot; and Amanda closed it with &quot;The Ukelele Song,&quot; bringing the whole audience to its feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the concert Amanda and Neil adjoined to the concessions lobby to sign books and CDs... and sign, and sign, and sign.&nbsp; Strong wrists, those two.&nbsp; And good hearts.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"show\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/176929/176929_300.jpg\" title=\"show\" width=\"225\" />\r\n\r\nEvery seat was filled.&nbsp; No surprise there.&nbsp; The concert sold out within hours of our announcing it.&nbsp; &quot;I need a larger theatre,&quot; as I wrote to Neil and Amanda, after tickets had been on sale for a few hours, &quot;at least when you two come to town.&quot;\r\n\r\nAll box receipts went to two worthy Santa Fe charities, Warehouse 21 and the Food Depot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Warehouse 21 works with local youth, while the Food Depot feeds the homeless and the hungry.&nbsp; The concert raised more than $9000, which will be split between them.&nbsp; To find out more about their work, go here http://www.warehouse21.org/ and here http://www.thefooddepot.org/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And CONTRIBUTE!\r\n\r\nNeil and Amanda regularly fill large halls and auditoriums with thousands of fans.&nbsp; It was incredibly kind of them to take time out of their busy schedule to visit Santa Fe and play our modest venue.&nbsp; Though I am delighted to report that they thought the Jean Cocteau was cool.&nbsp; (It is).\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"show4\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/177175/177175_300.jpg\" title=\"show4\" width=\"225\" />\r\n\r\nFor those locals who could not get tickets to the show (sorry for that, they sold out very quickly)... well, Neil signed large stacks of his books and comics for us before he took off, and we have Amanda&#39;s CDs in stock as well.&nbsp; So drop by the Jean Cocteau at 418 Montezuma, and you too can score an autographed Neil Gaiman book, or the latest CD from Amanda.&nbsp; But come soon... stocks are limited.\r\n\r\n(We also have a handful of signed copies of Michael Chabon&#39;s KAVALIER AND CLAY left, from his visit here, as well as autographed copies of many of my own books).\r\n\r\n(Sorry, we are not set up to do mail orders)\r\n\r\nLots more cool stuff coming up at the Cocteau: movies, author appearances and booksignings, live music, magic, comedy.&nbsp; If you want to keep on top of that, signed up for our weekly email newsletter.&nbsp; It&#39;s free.&nbsp; Go here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/contact-us/?view=edit\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies!","ditemid":339583,"eventtime":"2013-10-02 10:20:00","props":{"current_location":"santa fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, concerts, neil & amanda, movie theatre","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1387053895,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1382228873},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-10-02 16:20:14","anum":127,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/339583.html","event_timestamp":1380709200,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/339583.html?thread=18308991#t18308991","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/339583.html?thread=18308991#t18308991","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/339583.html?thread=18308991#t18308991","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lonmouth","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lonmouth.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18308991,"talkid":71519,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/339583.html?thread=18308991#t18308991","article":"Oh how I wish I was a New Mexican.

Shortly thereafter, I became a fan of Neil's. I was amazed & dumbfounded when these two people I admired so much separately came together. Then I became a fan of yours, GRRM, & burned TWICE through all of (the current) ASOIAF (plus Dunk & Egg) in a few weeks (& have watched all the GoT episodes several times as well). Now, again, I have the strange sensation of people I admire from (what strike me as very) separate realms of aesthetic endeavor coming together in a way that totally surprises, but also pleases, me. I'm so glad you are a fan of theirs (and that they are fans of yours)! I spend much of my free time directly consuming (or re-consuming) or at least thinking about works created by one or another of you three.
