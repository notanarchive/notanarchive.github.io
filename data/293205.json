{"itemid":1145,"subject":"Back Home","event":"Got back from LA yesterday evening.\r\n\r\nI had a great visit out there... well, aside from losing the Emmy (I am now 0-4 all time), but it IS an honor just to nominated, yadda yadda yadda.  Some amazing meetings followed, with some amazing people, most of which I can't tell you about... yet.  But maybe one day.\r\n\r\nAnd it's always nice to be back in Santa Fe, with Parris, the cats, and the minions.  And to escape the LA heat as well.\r\n\r\nBut the amount of crap that has piled up in my absence is daunting.  There's just too damn much.  Even with three assistants, I am falling further and further behind, and more and more stuff keeps getting dumped on my plate.  Somehow just walking back into my office after a trip sends my stress level ratcheting up to ten.  Or maybe to a hundred, depending on your scale.\r\n\r\nsigh\r\n\r\nThere is no help for it, I suppose.  Price of success, and all that.  And I know, lots and lots of folks would love to have my problems.  No one needs to tell me that.\r\n\r\nEven so...\r\n\r\n(Today's football games did not much help my mood either.  Life is meaningingless and full of pain...)","ditemid":293205,"eventtime":"2012-09-30 23:40:00","props":{"current_location":"home","taglist":"travels, writing, everyday life","current_moodid":28,"commentalter":1350262081,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sad sack","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1350500378},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-10-01 05:40:00","anum":85,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/293205.html","event_timestamp":1349048400,"reply_count":84,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/107840116/2239173","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/293205.html?thread=16684117#t16684117","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/293205.html?thread=16684117#t16684117","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/293205.html?thread=16684117#t16684117","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/293205.html?thread=16684117#t16684117","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cloudiestdragon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cloudiestdragon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16684117,"talkid":65172,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/293205.html?thread=16684117#t16684117","upictitle":"carolynn: kumagirl","article":"You can do it!!
