Even the Starbucks and Wells Fargo were sporting adobe walls. Is there a reason why that is? Is it a civic initiative, an ode to the historical significance of adobe, or simple practically?\n\nOh, and this guide would've come in handy.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 6 2014, 23:16:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Scenic Santa Fe","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/brad.buckles","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Brad Buckles","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2507292","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69751232&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Brad Buckles","ctime_ts":1417907805,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121380646/65290345","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/394128.html?thread=19804560#t19804560","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/394128.html?thread=19804560#t19804560","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/394128.html?thread=19804560#t19804560","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2051755","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/fafhrd.mouser","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19804560,"talkid":77361,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/394128.html?thread=19804560#t19804560","upictitle":"Fafhrd Mouser: pic#121380646","article":"If you are going to Santa Fe I recommend staying at this Inn.  <br /><br />It's located between the Jean Cocteau cinema and Old Santa Fe.
