{"itemid":3,"subject":"Not A Blog","event":"I'm calling this \"Not A Blog.\"\r\n\r\nI mean, I don't have time to do a weblog.  I don't have the energy to do a weblog.  There's just no way I could do a weblog.  \r\n\r\nI did have my own personal topic on GEnie once (ah, GEnie... a colossal time sink, that, but I do miss it sometimes).  A lot of people did.  Some of them posted every day.  Some posted every week.  I posted... well, I posted sometimes... when I had something to say, or something to announce, or...\r\n\r\nIt is likely to be the same here.  Be warned.  Days, weeks, and even months may go by with no new entries to this journal.  If so, that doesn't mean I've died.  Just the opposite, actually.  It probably means I'm busy doing stuff.  It may even mean that I'm writing.  After a long day at the computer writing fiction, the last thing I want to do is sit at the computer some more updating my weblog.\r\n\r\nEven so, I thought this might be a good idea.  My website has a number of different pages, but sometimes I want to add stuff that does not fit conveniently into any of the established categories.  \r\n\r\nPolitical commentary, for instance.  Last election I had a couple of political messages on my site that really irritated some of my visitors (and pleased even more, but never mind).  There were various reasons for that, but one was that I stuck the commentary onto the page called 'About A FEAST FOR CROWS.'  It was suggested that if I wanted to talk about politics, I should have a separate page for that.  Well, no.  If I had a political page, I'd need to update it, which would mean I would have to write a lot more about politics.  No, thanks.  \r\n\r\nThis is better.  I will talk politics here, in future.  I will talk about pizza here, in future.  I will report on trips here, upload con reports, complain about stuff (there's a lot to complain about in modern life, it seems to me, and we all need a place to vent).  I will, in short, post whatever the hell I want to here.\r\n\r\nJust don't expect me to do it very often.\r\n\r\nBecause this is Not A Blog.\r\n\r\nI don't have time to keep a weblog.","ditemid":850,"eventtime":"2005-07-02 19:40:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"Spain","commentalter":1439232006,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","opt_lockcomments":1,"revtime":1439232051},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2005-07-03 01:45:09","anum":82,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html","event_timestamp":1120333200,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=77906#t77906","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=77906#t77906","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=77906#t77906","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":77906,"talkid":304,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=77906#t77906","article":"yup, lots to complain about indeed, with an equal amout or more to praise or so it seems...though complaining is much more intertaining...or somthin like that....*mistifies self*<br />hell if i no...<br />well, your time in any case is appreciated by me at least, so vent away, i think its intertaining...*strolls away*","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"July 17 2006, 22:34:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"hiya","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1153175650,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=78930#t78930","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=78930#t78930","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=78930#t78930","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":78930,"talkid":308,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/850.html?thread=78930#t78930","article":"I didnt really know where to write you about this but I have read all four of the SOFAI books and I have seen many similarities to these and to Robert Jordans WHeel of Time series.
