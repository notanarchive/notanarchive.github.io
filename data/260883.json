{"itemid":1019,"subject":"More Magic","event":"And now it's Championship Sunday in the NFL.\r\n\r\nI meant to post about last week's fantastic Giants win at Green Bay, but there was so much else to catch up on when Parris and I returned from LA, I never got the chance.  Needless to say, it was a magical afternoon, and did help take some of the sting out of losing the Golden Globe.  Parris and I watched the first half of the game while dressing for the awards banquet, right up to that last second Hail Mary TD that Eli tossed to Hakeem Nicks.  I still have trouble believing that one, but it had the both of us screaming.  We listened to the third quarter in the limo creeping toward the Beverly Hilton past all the security and the crowds of religious lunatics.  But then it was time to go into the banquet.  Fortunately, David Benioff (another Giants fan) had an app on his iPhone that allowed him to check the score, and he kept updating the table.  I had to bite my tongue to keep from screaming \"YEAH! G-MEN\" when we finally locked it up.  \r\n\r\nHard to believe it has already been a week.\r\n\r\nSo... another tough game today against the 49ers.  And the rain will not help.  Here's hoping the Giants still have some magic left.  Win or lose, though, this has been an incredible run.  After that dismal loss to the Redskins late in the season, I really thought they were done.  I've never been so pleased to be proven wrong, wrong, wrong.\r\n\r\nAs for the early game, the AFC championship, I will be pulling for the Ravens, of course.  Should the Giants advance to the Superbowl, I would much rather face Joe Flacco than Tom Brady... and I would prefer the \"revenge factor\" working on my side.  Let's give the Giants a chance to avenge 2000, instead of having Brady and Evil Little Bill trying to avenge 2007.\r\n\r\nBut that's secondary for me.  Pats or Ravens, we'll take either one.  First we need to get past the Niners.","ditemid":260883,"eventtime":"2012-01-22 12:21:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1327293078,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1327293092},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-01-22 19:23:56","anum":19,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260883.html","event_timestamp":1327234860,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/80016799/16708657","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260883.html?thread=15287059#t15287059","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260883.html?thread=15287059#t15287059","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260883.html?thread=15287059#t15287059","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lcmello","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lcmello.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15287059,"talkid":59715,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260883.html?thread=15287059#t15287059","upictitle":"lcmello: pic#80016799","article":"Good luck on the game.
