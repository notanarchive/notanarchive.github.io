{"itemid":1414,"subject":"Game of Thrones Ascent for iPad ","event":"An Announcement brought to you by the Minions of Fevre River:\r\n\r\nLast year, Disruptor Beam developed Game of Thrones Ascent for the Web, and several million players&mdash;comprising thousands of alliances--have joined the conflict in Westeros.\r\n\r\nToday, Disruptor Beam just launched a new version of the game for iPad.\r\n\r\nIf you haven&rsquo;t tried the game since it first came out, it&rsquo;s worth checking out again now.&nbsp; Many features have been added, like forming alliances with other players for large-scale battles&mdash;not to mention a huge amount of content, items and artwork.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re brand new, then you&rsquo;re in for a treat: the iPad version is a big improvement over the Web version, with crisp graphics and an overhauled touchscreen interface. &nbsp;As Season 4 airs, the game will also feature weekly updates based on the events you watch on HBO.\r\n\r\nDisruptor Beam tells me that an Android tablet version will also be available in several weeks.&nbsp; For those of you with an iPad, you can download it today by following this link: <span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-ascent/id799145075?ls=1&amp;mt=8\" style=\"color:rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#9f9fe3;\">https://itunes.apple.<wbr />com/us/app/game-of-thrones-<wbr />ascent/id799145075?ls=1&amp;mt=8</span></a></span>\r\n\r\nYou can also get more information about all the versions of the game on Disruptor Beam&rsquo;s website: <a href=\"http://disruptorbeam.com/\" style=\"color:rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#9cbee6;\">http://disruptorbeam.<wbr />com</span></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/197385/197385_original.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ipad_screenshot\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/197385/197385_300.png\" title=\"ipad_screenshot\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAn Announcement brought to you by the Minions of Fevre River-","ditemid":362212,"eventtime":"2014-03-27 13:00:00","props":{"taglist":"gaming, minion post, ascent, games","set_to_schedule":1395863011,"commentalter":1396905323,"opt_lockcomments":1,"revtime_sch":1395864431,"picture_keyword":"Raya Golden","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"revtime":1396982269},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-03-27 19:00:35","anum":228,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362212.html","event_timestamp":1395925200,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362212.html?thread=18855396#t18855396","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362212.html?thread=18855396#t18855396","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362212.html?thread=18855396#t18855396","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2425445","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/107509764987935372854","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18855396,"talkid":73653,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362212.html?thread=18855396#t18855396","upictitle":"Boba Fett: pic#0","article":"I don't know if this is the right spot, but I wanted to say that new chapter was fantastic.
