{"itemid":1967,"subject":"A Win is a Win","event":"A win is a win.  And any win is better than a loss.\r\n\r\nStill... it is hard to get to excited about the Jets' victory yesterday.\r\n\r\nThey beat the Cleveland Browns.  The hapless, winless Cleveland Browns, who are clearly the worst team in the NFL this season, stumbling ahead toward next year's number one draft choice.\r\n\r\nThey <i><b><span style=\"font-size: 1.4em\">barely</span></b></i> beat the hapless, winless Cleveland Browns.  In fact, they were losing for much of the game.  Gang Green came out sleepwalking, and snoozed through the entire first half, allowing the Browns to run up a 20 - 7 lead.  The offense was asleep, the defense was asleep, and Fitz was just awful.\r\n\r\nThey woke up in the second half, hallelujah, and scored 24 unanswered points to take the lead.   Then, with the game seemingly in hand, they went back to sleep again in the final two minutes, to let Cleveland score a late TD and a 2-point conversion, so the whole thing came down to an onsides kick.  Final score 31-28.  \r\n\r\nIt was ugly and it was sloppy and it was way too close.   A win, sure, but not one for a Jets fan to feel very good about.   If the Jets are only twelve seconds and three points better than the Browns, it is hard to imagine they are going anywhere this year.\r\n\r\nBut at least it wasn't a loss.\r\n\r\n(The Giants had a bye)","ditemid":503679,"eventtime":"2016-10-31 11:57:00","props":{"current_mood":"cranky","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Oct 31 17:57:20 2016]R [Mon Oct 31 17:57:21 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/793149877815390208 ","current_moodid":8,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1478812729,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/793149877815390208","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.736058720105203]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1477936676}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1967?v=1478812766","revtime":1478812764},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-10-31 17:57:19","anum":127,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html","event_timestamp":1477915020,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126765166/79035824","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25125503#t25125503","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25125503#t25125503","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25125503#t25125503","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3874529","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/3279459618532/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25125503,"talkid":98146,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25125503#t25125503","etime_ts":"1477937245","article":"MY barely clinging to life New Orleans Saints SOMEHOW managed to beat the Seahawks, the world follows no order and chaos is the hook it hangs its hat upon.

But after this year's cascade of miseries, I decided to look closer at last year.  It appears that, with small exception, all of our wins came against teams with losing records.  We played poorly against teams with winning records. Fitz threw so many interceptibles that were not intercepted.  Our adjustments were absent, our clock management perplexing, and our defensive scheme weak against strong offenses.  Last year's schedule left us with an inflated sense of victory.<br /><br />As a result of this inflated sense of victory, the management and coaches made questionable off-season decisions.  Re-signing Fitzpatrick because of \"chemistry\".  Not addressing our clunky defensive scheme.  Continuing to play our 3-4 defensive ends as 4-3 pass rushers, positions they are not physically built for.  Replacing Ivory with a very different sort of running back, but then playing him as if he were a bruiser like Ivory.  Through both questionable action and willful inaction we did not address any of our issues from the previous year.<br /><br />Here is my concern for the rest of the season: I'm sure we will tally up many wins against teams with losing records, and, given what happened over the off-season, I'm sure the coaching staff will pat themselves on the back and not address many of the issues apparent in the first six games.  Maybe we will even squeeze out one win against the Patriots.  Soon the first six games will just be a distant memory.<br /><br />It's hard for me to celebrate a win like this when it just looks like we're moving closer towards that fate.  I would celebrate our win against the Browns if Fitz made better decisions, our scheme seemed less wonky, our secondary more effective (the interceptions we made were almost entirely the fault of McCown), our playcalling less conservative, and our star Cornerback more effortful.  But it was a game we probably would have lost to most other teams.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 1 2016, 06:16:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10155611067165577/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Maximilian Rubell","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3192148","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76214878&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"November 1 2016, 06:18:05 UTC","dname":"Maximilian Rubell","ctime_ts":1477981013,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25129855#t25129855","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25129855#t25129855","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25129855#t25129855","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"daleksinhyrule","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://daleksinhyrule.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25129855,"talkid":98163,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25129855#t25129855","upictitle":"daleksinhyrule: pic#0","article":"Well, at least the Patriots had a sound win ;) <br />...<br />(I still love you George, even if you hate my team and I'm no fan of yours) <br /><br />:) ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 1 2016, 09:16:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"A Win is a Win","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://daleksinhyrule.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"daleksinhyrule","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"daleksinhyrule","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://daleksinhyrule.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"daleksinhyrule","ctime_ts":1477991794,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123030036/69666572","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130111#t25130111","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130111#t25130111","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130111#t25130111","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2501806","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/JessDyba","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25130111,"talkid":98164,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130111#t25130111","upictitle":"Jess Dyba: pic#123030036","article":"Looking like the class of the NFC East, if not the entire NFC.  <br /><br />Cowboys-Patriots superbowl?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 1 2016, 14:58:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"How bout them Cowboys?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/JessDyba","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jess Dyba","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2501806","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69666572&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jess Dyba","ctime_ts":1478012329,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130879#t25130879","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130879#t25130879","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130879#t25130879","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25130879,"talkid":98167,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/503679.html?thread=25130879#t25130879","above":25130111,"upictitle":"George R.R.
