Too hideous to write about.\r\n\r\nAnd the aftermath is even worse.  Sanchez to be traded?  (Who would want him?  He leads the league in turnovers, and his salary and cap figure are through the roof.  What would they offer, a bag of used jockstraps?)  Tebow wants out.  (Who could blame him?)  And next season, the rumor mill insists, Gang Green may start over again with...\r\n\r\n .... Michael Vick.\r\n\r\nMichael Fucking Vick.\r\n\r\nNo, thank you.  I don't want Michael Vick on my team.  If he comes here, I guess I root only for the Giants until the Dogkiller departs.\r\n\r\nI guess I have only one shred of hope left to cling to.  Maybe this Greg McElroy kid is the new Tom Brady.  Yeah, he's a seventh round pick, but Brady was a sixth rounder.  Maybe McElroy is the real deal... \r\n\r\nOr maybe the horse will talk.","ditemid":304444,"eventtime":"2012-12-20 13:35:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":127,"commentalter":1356314039,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs down","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1356331611},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-12-20 20:35:58","anum":60,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html","event_timestamp":1356010500,"reply_count":63,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16984892#t16984892","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16984892#t16984892","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16984892#t16984892","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jshetina07","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jshetina07.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16984892,"talkid":66347,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16984892#t16984892","upictitle":"jshetina07: pic#0","article":"I am a die hard Bears fan but if they brought in the dogkiller I would start rooting for the packers.

What Michael Vick did to dogs was despicable, a truly horrifying crime against innocent animals. At first, I felt as appalled as you. As a dog lover myself, I swore undying hatred to a quarterback who was already the bane of my NFC South. I simply could not fathom what kind of person - other than a Ramsay Bolton, maybe - could treat another living creature with such utter malice. In time, however, I found that forgiving Vick was not only the compassionate thing to do, but also a practical way to help make the world a better place.<br /><br />After the \"Bad Newz Kennels\" was exposed, Vick lost his promising job, went completely bankrupt, was imprisoned for almost two years of his life, and suffered more public scorn than perhaps any other athlete in the history of the National Football League, if not all of professional sports. What other athlete has had pundits call for his summary execution? Now, his life having been ruined - and rightly so; he got what he deserved - Vick is trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild. I respect his perseverance in the face of overwhelming adversity from bitter ex-fans, teams rightly concerned about protecting their brand, and countless other people and organizations who could not care less about football but who loathe dog fighting and animal cruelty.<br /><br />While Vick was imprisoned, he sought out the counsel of Tony Dungy. Dungy, after assessing Vick's priorities (he needed to be sure that Vick was genuinely penitent), began visiting and mentoring him in prison, helping him reconnect with the lost faith of his younger years. When Vick was released from prison, Dungy vouched for his character to NFL teams who were considering him. In the end, it was Dungy and Donovan McNabb who convinced Jeff Lurie and Andy Reid to give Vick another chance in Philadelphia. Dungy even wrote a foreword to Vick's autobiography, for goodness' sake!<br /><br />Dungy, the NFL's closest thing to a conscience (sorry Bob Costas), is a man whose opinion should carry some weight. Dungy's philanthropy has persisted beyond his days as a coach in Tampa and Indianapolis, and he remains deeply involved with charities like \"Family First\" and the \"Boys and Girls Club\" to this day. Dungy knows Vick better than any of us, and if he trusts him and is willing to attest that he is a changed man, surely that counts for something. Just as there is more to Jaime Lannister's story than being an \"oathbreaker\" or \"kingslayer,\" there is more to Vick's story than just being a \"Dogkiller.\"<br /><br />In the end - opinions about Vick, dog fighting, and animal cruelty aside - what is a more inspiring message to the world? Someone who has fallen from grace rising above his failures to become a better man, or someone who has fallen from grace thwarted from rising above his failures and condemned to a life of misery? Personally, I want to live in a world in which people are encouraged to overcome their past sins, seek forgiveness, and redeem themselves, not a world in which anyone who has ever done something wrong - and we all fall short - is eternally damned. The former sends a message of hope, the latter, despair. The latter is not even human, for learning from our mistakes is an essential part of life. Without the chance to fall down and try again, the world would be an awfully cruel place. Granted, Vick \"fell down\" horrendously, but that is what would make his comeback an even more inspiring example.<br /><br />Where would Jaime Lannister - the wildly popular anti-hero who readers first meet shoving an innocent child to what he believes will be his death for the offense of catching him in the act of incest with his twin sister - be without the possibility of redemption and forgiveness? A character cannot start at a much deeper deficit than Jaime, yet in the course of the story he has grown far more than anyone ever anticipated. We should follow Brienne's example, not Lady Stoneheart's.<br /><br />If nothing else, Vick should be commended for trying against all odds. It is not as if Vick is getting away with murder. Even if this injury-crushing season is not his last, Vick's fame and fortune will always be a shadow of what they once were.<br /><br />I love dogs, but I love human compassion, the hope of redemption, and the promise of a better world more.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"December 21 2012, 00:08:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Redemption Over Revenge","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/james.r.roesch","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"James Rutledge Roesch","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1558807","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=57125169&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 21 2012, 00:16:08 UTC","dname":"James Rutledge Roesch","ctime_ts":1356048508,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16990780#t16990780","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16990780#t16990780","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16990780#t16990780","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16990780#t16990780","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16990780,"talkid":66370,"etime_ts":"1356049388","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/304444.html?thread=16990780#t16990780","above":16990524,"upictitle":"George R.R.
