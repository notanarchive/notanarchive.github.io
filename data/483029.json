{"itemid":1886,"subject":"Coming Soon to the Jean Cocteau","event":"The Jean Cocteau Cinema was Santa Fe's first \"arthouse\" theatre (it opened in 1977, as the Collective Fantasy), and one of the hallmarks of so-called arthouses is that they show foreign films that the big multiplexes don't touch.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is with us.  Today we like to say that we're the most eclectic movie theatre in The City Different, but foreign films remain an important part of our mix.  Only the foreign films we show are a little different than the ones you might catch at other arthouses.\r\n\r\nThis week, for instance, we're showing MY BIG NIGHT, a hilarious romp by the Spanish filmmaker Alex de la Iglesia.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"723\"/>\r\n\r\nComing up in the next few weeks we have two the biggest-grossing films in the entire world... but they're two films you may never have heard of, if you're in the US, since they have received almost no attention in America.  I'm speaking of MERMAID and MONSTER HUNT, both out of China.\r\n\r\nHave a taste:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"724\"/>\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"725\"/>\r\n\r\nWatch our website for showtimes.\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies.","ditemid":483029,"eventtime":"2016-04-26 23:22:00","props":{"current_mood":"artistic","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, jean cocteau cinema, films","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Apr 23 23:54:59 2016]R [Sat Apr 23 23:55:01 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/724023802644983809 ","current_moodid":108,"commentalter":1461737850,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/724023802644983809","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":5,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.689451388490751]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1461455707}","revtime":1462313115},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-23 23:54:55","anum":213,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483029.html","event_timestamp":1461712920,"reply_count":7,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483029.html?thread=24255189#t24255189","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483029.html?thread=24255189#t24255189","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483029.html?thread=24255189#t24255189","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"o0crispy0o","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://o0crispy0o.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24255189,"talkid":94746,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483029.html?thread=24255189#t24255189","upictitle":"o0crispy0o: pic#0","article":"Its been so long since I have watched movies from foreign markets, it was a staple of mine growing up.
