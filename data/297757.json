{"itemid":1163,"subject":"World Fantasy Awards","event":"Just heard that OSAMA, by Lavie Tidhar, won this year's World Fantasy Award (also known as the Howard and/or Howie, since the trophy is a bust of H.P. Lovecraft by Gahan Wilson).  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/460/153538\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/153538/153538_300.jpg\" alt=\"images\" title=\"images\" width=\"127\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI haven't read the novel myself, but I hear good things about it.  Congratulations to Lavie Tidhar.\r\n\r\nThe WFC did award me one of this year's \"Lifetime Achievement\" awards.  \r\n\r\nMy thanks to the jury.  My editor, Anne Lesley Groell, was going to accept the award for me, but Sandy marooned in NYC.  I did sent a few words to the conom; I trust that someone or other got and read them on my behalf.\r\n\r\nAlan Garner was also given a Lifetime Achievement award.  I was very pleased to see that.  Garner, the author of THE OWL SERVICE and THE WEIRDSTONE OF BRISINGAMEN and many other fine, fine fantasies, is long overdue for some recognition.  If you're not familiar with his books, you have a treat coming.  Go out, find them, read them.","ditemid":297757,"eventtime":"2012-11-04 17:55:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"world fantasy convention, awards, dance with dragons","current_moodid":92,"commentalter":1352225471,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1352240430},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-11-05 00:55:29","anum":29,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/297757.html","event_timestamp":1352051700,"reply_count":9,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98605106/11925761","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/297757.html?thread=16812829#t16812829","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/297757.html?thread=16812829#t16812829","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/297757.html?thread=16812829#t16812829","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sue_bursztynski","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sue-bursztynski.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16812829,"talkid":65675,"etime_ts":"1352077566","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/297757.html?thread=16812829#t16812829","upictitle":"sue_bursztynski: pic#98605106","article":"Congratulations!
