Feh.  How can they understand the true nature of horror unless they're fans of the New York Jets?\r\n\r\nI guess I will need to get by this year without my annual dose of Chris Berman and Mel Kiper.  I do plan to check in from time to time.  Surely the Queen Mary has ESPN.\r\n\r\nIf wishes were fishes, both of my teams would land running backs.   I want the Jets to draft Leonard Fournette with the sixth overall pick, and the Giants to take Christian McCaffery.  I loves me a good running game.  Smashmouth football rules!\r\n\r\nMany of the mocks are projecting that both teams will get tight ends instead: OJ Howard to Gang Green, David Njoku to Big Blue.  That would be good as well.  A great TE can make a huge difference.\r\n\r\nWhat the G-Men need most of all, of course, is a huge road-grinder of an offensive lineman.\r\n\r\nThe Jets need everything.","ditemid":535091,"eventtime":"2017-04-27 12:53:00","props":{"current_mood":"frustrated","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":47,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"version":1,"commentalter":1494645476,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.749551889190713]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1493319220}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2090?v=1494645499","revtime":1494645497},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-04-27 18:53:21","anum":51,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html","event_timestamp":1493297580,"reply_count":35,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126260951/72347384","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26053683#t26053683","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26053683#t26053683","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26053683#t26053683","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lostvalyrian","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lostvalyrian.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26053683,"talkid":101772,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26053683#t26053683","upictitle":"lostvalyrian: pic#126260951","article":"\"How can they understand the true nature of horror unless they're fans of the New York Jets?\"<br /><br />This is funny!

Jets should be delighted with Jamal. Seems to ooze energy and charisma. Regarding his plays he has that decisiveness and just a touch more uncapped aggression that you like to see. I see him as a cross between Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman which is as good as you'll get in the Secondary. Giants pick was okay though I'd like to read more on why they rated Engram above Njoku. And why they didnt pick someone on the O-Line (only 1 had gone by that point) is another question that needs answer.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 weeks ago","ctime":"April 28 2017, 15:18:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://boomkrashhh.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"boomkrashhh","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"boomkrashhh","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://boomkrashhh.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"boomkrashhh","ctime_ts":1493392707,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26057523#t26057523","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26057523#t26057523","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26057523#t26057523","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"harryberger89","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://harryberger89.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26057523,"talkid":101787,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/535091.html?thread=26057523#t26057523","upictitle":"harryberger89: pic#0","article":"Thank god the Gmen lost out on OJ Howard that dude is an animal.

I wouldn't call the Engram pick disappointing, but it wasn't who I had in mind. Same thing happened with Eli Apple last year though and he turned into a stud. Hopefully Engram does the same and lives up to the Jordan Reed comparisons. There was a video on NFL.com comparing their two 40 yard dashes and Engram was way in front of Reed. He also has faster time than prolific receivers such as A.J.
