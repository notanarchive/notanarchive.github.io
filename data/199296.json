{"itemid":778,"subject":"Suvudu Cage Match","event":"Those scalawags and wackaroonies at Suvudu are at it again!\r\n\r\nLast year they staged their infamous \"Cage Match,\" pitting various characters from a wide varity of SF and fantasy books and films against one another in battles to the death, with the ultimate winner decided by the votes of you, the fans and readers.  (AFter spirited and sometimes rather acrimonious debate, it must be said).  They plucked Ser Jaime Lannister out of Westeros to represent my books, and he did rather well... Assisted by his brother Tyrion, he defeated Hermione Granger, Kvothe, and the Great Cthulhu on the way to the finals, where he ultimately fell to THE WHEEL OF TIME's Rand al'Thor, despite some help from Haviland Tuf, the Great and Powerful Turtle, Popinjay, and other friends. \r\n\r\nSuvudu followed that up with a Villains Cage Match, another death derby.  This time Westeros prevailed, when Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, went all the way, proving himself the most nefarious and brutal badboy of all time and space.  But then he got his ass kicked by Rand in the Hero v. Villain showdown.\r\n\r\nAnd now here we are again.  This time the Westerosi contestant is JON SNOW.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000eggp7/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000eggp7/s640x480\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\nart by Michael Komarck\r\n\r\nIn his first match, Jon is facing Takeshi Kovacs .\r\n\r\nHere's the write up:\r\n \r\nhttp://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/03/cage-match-2011-takeshi-kovacs-versus-jon-snow.html\r\n \r\nVote early and often.","ditemid":199296,"eventtime":"2011-03-08 23:14:00","props":{"current_location":"home","taglist":"suvudu, cage match, game of thrones","current_moodid":115,"commentalter":1300035376,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1300258481},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-03-10 06:14:29","anum":128,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/199296.html","event_timestamp":1299626040,"reply_count":35,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/92136025/47058","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/199296.html?thread=12480384#t12480384","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/199296.html?thread=12480384#t12480384","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/199296.html?thread=12480384#t12480384","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/199296.html?thread=12480384#t12480384","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mouseferatu","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mouseferatu.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12480384,"talkid":48751,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/199296.html?thread=12480384#t12480384","upictitle":"Ari: The Conqueror&#39;s Shadow","article":"And if any of George's fan would be willing to spare an extra moment for an up-and-coming writer who doesn't have <i>nearly</i> George's level of renown, my own Corvis Rebaine would dearly love any leftover support you might be kind enough to offer him in his own match.<br /><br /><a href='http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/03/cage-match-2011-severus-snape-versus-corvis-rebaine.html' rel='nofollow'>http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/03/ca<wbr />ge-match-2011-severus-snape-versus-corvi<wbr />s-rebaine.html</a> (They've also included a link to my own page, where they asked me to write up my own version of how I think the match should go.)<br /><br />Thanks.
