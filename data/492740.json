{"itemid":1924,"subject":"Wild Cards in Kansas City","event":"As this year's worldcon in Kansas City moves ever closer, schedules are starting to firm up, and there are going to be some exciting things in the works... especially for fans of Wild Cards.\r\n\r\n HIGH STAKES, the concluding volume in the current Wild Cards triad and the twenty-third in the overall series, is actually scheduled for hardcover release on August 23, after worldcon is over.   However (fingers crossed), Tor is doing all it can to get some advance copies to Kansas City ahead of time, so we can launch the book at worldcon.   (This one is our Lovecraftian horror outing.   For a taste, check the sample chapter on my website).  \r\n\r\n To celebrate the release of the new one... and hell, all the old ones too... we are planning to have a huge WILD CARDS MASS SIGNING at the con.  It seemed only fitting; there will be more Wild Cards authors (old and new) present in Kansas City than at any other convention ever (yes, even more than at Nolacon in 1988, where Wild Cards lost a Hugo to Watchmen).  At last count, the list includes Walter Jon Williams, John Jos. Miller, Gail Gerstner-Miller, Carrie Vaughn, Caroline Spector, Diana Rowland, Walton (Bud) Simons, Bob Wayne, Kevin Andrew Murphy, Stephen Leigh, S.L. Farrell, David D. Levine, Michael Cassutt, Marko Kloos, Saladin Ahmed, Pat Cadigan, Laura J. Mixon, Paul Cornell, Mary Anne Mohanraj... and of course Melinda M. Snodgrass and yours truly.  So if you have a large collection of Wild Cards books you'd like defaced... or would like to <i>start</i> a large collection of Wild Cards books... MidAmericon II is the place to do it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/369084/369084_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/369335/369335_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/369600/369600_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe signing will be sponsored by Rainy Day Books, and will be a ticketed event.  It will take place in the Marriott Muhlebach (room tba) on Friday August 19, from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm.  Rainy Day Books should have all of the volumes currently in print for sale there, in addition to HIGH STAKES... and also a good selection of other titles by all of the participating writers, for those who would like to sample their non-wild card books.   (However, I won't be signing any Ice & Fire events at this event, I have two other general signings in the dealer's room, three hours total, so there will be ample opportunity for readers to get their GAME OF THRONES books signed there).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/369840/369840_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/369994/369994_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/370257/370257_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe signing will not be the only Wild Cards activity at Big MAC II.   With so many writers on hand, doing your traditional panel discussion would have been impossible.  By the time all the panelists finished introducing themselves, the hour would have been up.  Instead we've decided to offer WILD CARDS DEATH MATCHES.   Kind of like Thunderdome with writers (and their characters).  Sixteen writers enter (well, maybe only twelve, the count keeps jumping around as plans change), and one will emerge.   The audience will pick the winners and losers of the fights.   That one is scheduled for Saturday afternoon, August 20, 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm.  Should be a hoot and a half... or a bloodbath.   Who the hell knows?   We've never done this sort of thing before.   \r\n\r\nPut the times and dates down in your worldcon calendar, and come join the fun.\r\n\r\n(And hey, for all those who can't be in Kansas City for the mass signing, autographed copies of all the books pictured above are available from the Jean Cocteau Cinema Bookstore, though admittedly they don't have as many signatures as the ones bought in KC are like to have.   And yes, we are now taking international orders).","ditemid":492740,"eventtime":"2016-07-14 00:32:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, wild cards, worldcon, signings, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Jul  9 06:31:42 2016]R [Sat Jul  9 06:31:43 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/751665116362317824 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1486436437,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/751665116362317824","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.647840637856512]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1468045901}","revtime":1468638684},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-07-09 06:31:40","anum":196,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html","event_timestamp":1468456320,"reply_count":32,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126320188/78180041","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?replyto=24738500","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24738500#t24738500","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24738500#t24738500","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24738500#t24738500","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24738500#t24738500","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3737990","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10154951434284428/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24738500,"talkid":96634,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24738500#t24738500","upictitle":"Matt DeRuyter: pic#126320188","article":"Sorry if I've missed an obvious answer, but will there be signings of ASOIAF in KC?

I often dream to be other people and not myself, living in different time periods, being of different gender etc. But I can't remember that I ever dreamed I was a fictional character from a book, especially another man's book. <br /><br />Well now, last night that changed, because I had a short yet incredibly emotional dream where I was none other than Jon Snow. Mind you, I didn't look like Kit Harrington from the show (no one in the dream did), or myself for that matter. No, it was a face that I have never seen before reflecting at me from a pool of water.<br /><br />I was walking through the godswood. The air had that sweet smell of spring in it, the birds were chirping, the sun was shining, but there was still just a hint of a chill surrounding it all. I was walking towards the great weirwood tree and there was this mixed feeling in my heart. Joy intertwined with sadness. The tree was still some way off but I could see a young woman sitting under it. Mere sight of her made my mouth twirl into a smile. The tree itself was completely dead. No dreamers inside it, I instinctively knew. The girl saw me. She stood up, stretched her arms in the air and started running. I fastened my pace to meet her. Next moment she was there beside me. Standing still. Looking at me quizzically. With cheeks pink from sudden activity. Her brown hair flew freely around her shoulders. The most gorgeous sight to my eyes. Arya. She flashed me a smile of her own, then hugged me tightly while laying her head into my left shoulder. Our hearts were beating as one.<br /><br />Then I woke up, kissed my wife and went to work. But the dream stayed with me through the day and for some inexplicable reason I wanted to share it with you. <br /><br />Best of luck with all your future endeavors from Simon, a true fan from Croatia.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 months ago","ctime":"July 9 2016, 15:39:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"a beautiful dream...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://vk.com/id373611554","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/vkontakte-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Simon Hilandar","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3738429","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=78181169&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Simon Hilandar","ctime_ts":1468078743,"tracked":0},{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"ext_2991301","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/JOHaN117","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24740548,"talkid":96642,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24740548#t24740548","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 months ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/JOHaN117","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Johannes Hdz A","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2991301","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=74150754&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Johannes Hdz A","ctime_ts":1468100611,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?replyto=24743620","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24743620#t24743620","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24743620#t24743620","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24743620#t24743620","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24743620#t24743620","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24743620,"talkid":96654,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492740.html?thread=24743620#t24743620","above":24740548,"upictitle":"George R.R.

My family doesn't have a great deal of money but that didn't stop them from making my dream of experiencing an ASOIAF birthday from becoming an actuality via an army of glue guns, sewing needles, paints, and numerous pleadings with the muse. <br /><br />With the exception of the house banners and the throne cake topper, they made all of the props and extras featured here including baking sugared crystals to resemble the fire in the ice/fire cake, hand painting an actual life-size iron throne of my very own, crafting a music box complete with colored dragon eggs that my kiddos made out of thumb tacks, coloring citadel candles fashioned out of paper towel tubes, and finally sewing a wreath of blue roses for me to wear. My favorite surprise, however, was being presented with a Westie puppy a few days later which they had adopted and subsequently dubbed Khaleesi, Dognaerys--the first of her name--Pupgaryen. <br /><br />I hope these images made you smile, George, and served as a reminder of how much your work continues to impact your fans. I only wish I could meet you in Kansas.
