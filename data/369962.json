I may be getting ahead of myself, but I just fear that they are indeed delving into some subject material we have yet to encounter in the books, or just the massive deviations that we've seen from time to time. I'm not trying to nit pick, but as someone who began reading this series in 1998, I often have to wonder if I should continue to watch the show, or just continue to wait for Winds of Winter. I'll keep watching for now though, for one, because I just love seeing this world finally being brought to life, and two, I'm hooked. Just a bit concerned, there are certain things I would much prefer to encounter in print before I encounter them in a rushed scene on cable.

I love the show and think that it's really excellent, but for me, it just can't beat the books.<br /><br />The ending to the \"Oathkeeper\" episode, though, raised some concerns.  Are we at the point now where the show may be spoiling things that are yet to be seen in the books?  Because if and when that happens, I will reluctantly stop watching the show until the books are completed.<br /><br />Nobody has given a definitive answer to that question yet.  Was the final scene from \"Oathkeeper\" confirmation of something that many have suspected, but has not yet been explicitly revealed in the books?  Or was it something that the showrunners have added (which is totally fine, I'm not suggesting that the show must adhere strictly to the books)?  Are we at the point where we have to be wary of book spoilers in the show?<br /><br />This probably sounds a little pedantic to some, but when it comes to things I really love, I am super sensitive to spoilers, and I'll bet I'm probably not the only one.<br /><br />Thanks.  Also, congratulations.  It is pretty great the the books I've loved for years have become the cultural phenomenon they always deserved to be.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"May 7 2014, 05:10:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://markerikson.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"markerikson","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"markerikson","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://markerikson.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"markerikson","ctime_ts":1399439407,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/369962.html?thread=19083306#t19083306","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/369962.html?thread=19083306#t19083306","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/369962.html?thread=19083306#t19083306","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/369962.html?thread=19083306#t19083306","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19083306,"talkid":74544,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/369962.html?thread=19083306#t19083306","above":19082538,"upictitle":"George R.R.
