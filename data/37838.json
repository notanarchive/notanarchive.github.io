{"itemid":147,"subject":"John W. Campbell Award","event":"The John W. Campbell Award is presented annually along with the Hugos.  It's a \"new writer\" award, given to the best new writer to enter the field during the previous two years.  As such, it is often (though not always) the first recognition a newcomer to our genre ever receives.  It's a great boost to a budding career, and something that winners and nominees both will long treasure.  (You never forget your first time).\r\n\r\nAll that was certainly true for me.  I published my first story in 1971, which meant that I was eligible for the very first Campbell Award when it was presented at Torcon 2 in 1973.  I lost (to Jerry Pournelle), but the nomination was a huge thrill for me, and helped encourage me in those dark days that all young writers battle through.\r\n\r\nAll of which is a long-winded way of saying that the Campbell Award is important, and I urge everyone reading this to be sure and nominate their own favorite new writers.  The Campbell is governed by the same rules as the Hugos, so you can nominate online at the Denvention website whose URL I gave below.\r\n\r\nWhat's that you say?  You read new writers, but you don't keep track of when they first published, so you're not sure who is eligible for the award and who's not?  \r\n\r\nFortunately, there's an easy fix.  Just go to http://www.writertopia.com/awards/campbell and you'll find a whole website devoted to keeping track of new writers and Campbell eligibles.  Check it out, and I'm sure you'll find some writers you've enjoyed... and others that you may not have heard of yet who you need to check out.\r\n\r\nThen read, nominate, vote.\r\n\r\nWe have an especially strong crop of new young fantasists coming up of late, including Joe Abercrombie, David Anthony Durham, and Scott Lynch (who was a Campbell Award finalist last year, losing to Naomi Novik, but is eligible again this year).  The Campbell does not usually draw nearly the number of nominations the major Hugos do, and sometimes only one or two votes decide who gets on the ballot and who doesn't... so if you don't nominate and your personal favorite misses the cut, you'll have only yourself to blame.","ditemid":37838,"eventtime":"2008-02-24 15:17:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":392,"commentalter":1204059027,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-24 22:35:21","anum":206,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html","event_timestamp":1203866220,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/44589028/1199704","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?replyto=3543246","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3543246#t3543246","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3543246#t3543246","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3543246#t3543246","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"gehayi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gehayi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3543246,"talkid":13840,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3543246#t3543246","upictitle":"Gehayi: winteriscoming (sasha_davidovna)","article":"Oh, I wish I <b>could</b> nominate and vote!

Closer to 15,000.<br /><br />That seems like a lot today, and indeed, in the current market, a sale of 15,000 copies for a mass market paperback short story collection would be considered quite robust.  But in 1977, it sucked.  There were fewer books being published then, and the average SF paperback sold around 30,000 copies, according to the conventional wisdom of the day.  Indeed, A SONG FOR LYA AND OTHER STORIES, a year before, had sold three times as many copies as we got out of STARS AND SHADOWS before the flood destroyed the rest.<br /><br />The hideous puke green cover didn't help either.  LYA, the year before, had the infamous \"flying lips\" cover by Patrick Woodruffe, which has gone on to become an iconic image.  Whatever you think of it (some loved it, some hated it), it really popped on the racks.  The cover for STARS AND SHADOWS faded into the wallpaper.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 26 2008, 19:39:49 UTC","parent":3558094,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Songs of Stars and Shadows","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1204054789,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/22865467/5045564","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?replyto=3558606","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3558606#t3558606","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3558606#t3558606","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3558606#t3558606","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"james_nicoll","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://james-nicoll.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3558606,"talkid":13900,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37838.html?thread=3558606#t3558606","above":3558350,"upictitle":"james_nicoll: pic#22865467","article":"Back when I ran a game store, White Wolf released a game called (IIRC) Oblivion. Apparently they decided that since the title for Vampire: The Masquerade was hard to read and V;tM sold well, being hard to read must be a sales-plus. The title on Oblivion was done in a glow-in-the-dark ink that was only visible in the dark. In a well lit store, it could not be seen at all. This was not actually a plus as far as sales were concerned. <br /><br />To make matters worse, the general cover scheme was the same greyish colour as my wall display, which meant that it was completely invisible in my store. For customers to find the game at all I had to lead them to it.
