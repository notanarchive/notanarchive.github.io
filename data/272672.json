These trips can be very costly for us, so regrettably we'll have to wait for another opportunity meet you.<br /><br />So ultimately the reason I'm sending this message is to ask a question.<br />...and it took a bit to get here I know(sorry); I just felt compelled to explain.<br /><br />The question is:<br />What are the odds that you'll be making a trip near Windsor sometime in the future, or perhaps returning to Toronto again?<br /><br />Meeting you is on the top of my list of things to do, as your wonderful writings have helped to alleviate stress during numerous times of sadness.<br />Your novels have allowed me to escape to another place during the 15 years of my sister's illness/Sick Kids hospitalizations prior to her death 2 years ago(Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia).<br />They have obviously also helped throughout the many issues/hospitalizations with my son since his birth 3 years ago as well.<br />Also, they’ve helped with every time of death and/or feeling of hopelessness between and since then.<br />I wish I could say there hasn’t been many, but I cannot.<br />It’s been a bad 15-20 years to say the least.<br /><br />Anyway...I will anxiously await your reply, however; even if your answer is not as I hope, I take this opportunity to thank you now.<br />I appreciate your skill as a writer, and your amazing ability to tell a story capable of captivating someone completely.<br />This is a talent that is very much desired when suffering times of heartache.<br />To me, it’s something invaluable that has helped me through the toughest of times...and for that I can honestly say I cannot ever thank you enough.<br />I realize that you didn't write these books for me specifically, though that doesn't negate the fact that they were therapeutic to me as the reader.<br /><br />Have a wonderful day sir; I truly hope your time in Toronto is/was pleasant.<br /><br /><br />Steve<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 14 2012, 13:37:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I WISH!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://striplay.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"striplay","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"striplay","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://striplay.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"March 14 2012, 13:43:01 UTC","dname":"striplay","ctime_ts":1331732254,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97353112/5010103","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272672.html?thread=15661088#t15661088","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272672.html?thread=15661088#t15661088","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272672.html?thread=15661088#t15661088","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"misscato","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://misscato.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15661088,"talkid":61176,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272672.html?thread=15661088#t15661088","upictitle":"Grand Cato of Catos: Golden Dragon","article":"Man, that line up was long!
