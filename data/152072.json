{"itemid":594,"subject":"A Few Last Words","event":"I've just locked the comments section of the previous post.  We've had about four hundred comments since the post went up last night, and the whole thing is about to collapse under its own weight.  I suspect that someone or other has already said everything that can be said on the subject, so now we're starting to go around in circles.\r\n\r\nAlso, with this many comments, it's becoming obvious that some of the later commenters aren't actually reading what went before.  I'm starting to get asked the same questions over and over again -- what about Suvudu?  what about the Vance book?  what about fan art?  what about role-playing games?  All fair enough questions, but I have answered all of them in responses to earlier comments.  Some I have answered two or three times by now.  I am not going to answer them four, five, six, or twelve times, sorry.  So if you've posted a question that has already been asked and answered, your post will likely be ignored or deleted.  (Yes, I know it's a pain to have to read four hundred comments.  Tough.  If I have to read them all, so do you.  That's the price of taking part in the discussion).\r\n\r\nSome comments haven't been unscreened yet.  There have been so many of them coming in so fast that it has been hard to keep up.  A few have been buried by now, especially comments on comments on comments.  Ty or I will get to all of them eventually, I hope, and everything will either be unscreened or deleted.\r\n\r\nI want to thank ninety-five percent of the people who took the time to comment.  I appreciate your thoughts, and even more, I appreciate the relative calm and thoughtful tone of this discussion, which never degenerated into the kind of ugliness I've seen (and am still seeing) in the comments over on Diana Gabaldon's blog, where the discussion has long since been derailed.  I don't know how many minds were changed here, but all the major issues were thoroughly aired, it seems to me, and I hope this generated more light than heat.  \r\n\r\nThere were a few issues raised during the debate that I'd like to address a bit further.\r\n\r\nA number of commenters suggested that I was wrong in my assertion that copyrights need to be defended, and suggested that I was confusing copyrights with trademarks.  Perhaps so.  This was raised often enough that it is obviously something I need to look into further.  There were also posters who agreed with what I wrote, however, including some who identified themselves as lawyers or law students, so I don't think the issue is as clear cut as the \"trademark\" folks are claiming.  I'll investigate this, and if I was wrong about this, I will come back here and say so (eventually, this is not my top priority in life).  If I was right, I'll come back and mention that as well.\r\n\r\nERB v HPL.  I never said that allowing others to play with the Cthulhu mythos was the ONLY reason Lovecraft died in poverty.  Actually, I am a huge Lovecraft fan, and not much of a Burroughs fan at all (though Melinda Snodgrass and I did once work on the screenplay for A PRINCESS OF MARS).  I know a lot about HPL.  His work has been hugely influential on modern horror.  But my point stands.  I could write a Cthulhu Mythos novel tomorrow, and I would not have to pay a dime to any Lovecraft estate (if such exists) or get their permission.  I would never dare write a Barsoom novel, though surely PRINCESS is in the public domain by now.  (The later John Carter and Tarzan novels may still be under copyright).\r\n\r\nA few people have quoted or posted links to the other side of the Marion Zimmer Bradley incident, the account of the fan involved.  Fine, two sides to every story, check it out.  At this point, twenty years after the fact, it all becomes she said/ she said.  But the version I posted was hardly \"urban legend,\" as one commenter called it.  It was the version given by Marion Zimmer Bradley herself in SFWA FORUM, what she told the rest of the writing community.  If you want to believe she lied, well, that's your prerogative.\r\n\r\nMore thoughts as I have 'em.  Just now, I have work to do.","ditemid":152072,"eventtime":"2010-05-08 14:58:00","props":{"current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1273531597,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":752,"opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"28:4,17:4,18:8,35:6,10:2,36:2,42:4,16:4,3:61,25:6,19:4,4:44,9:14,21:4,nterms:no","verticals_list":"books","revtime":1273533397},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-05-08 20:58:52","anum":8,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html","event_timestamp":1273330680,"reply_count":108,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/12343406/668056","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9953288#t9953288","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9953288#t9953288","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9953288#t9953288","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9953288#t9953288","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aghrivaine","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aghrivaine.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9953288,"talkid":38880,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9953288#t9953288","article":"For what it's worth, I went from having an attitude of \"I think writer's are doing a disservice to their fans when they stop them from playing with fan-fic,\" to a \"It sucks for everyone but the possible negatives outweigh the possible positives, so I think writer's are justified in limiting or disallowing fan-fic\" as a direct result of the arguments you presented. <br /><br />A well-written, logical and reasonable argument stands every chance of being persuasive.

She was writing us out of character, and we were immediately butthurt about the bad dialogue and inaccurate motivations ascribed to us even before coming on to the meat of the matter. Just say no to badfic, kids!)<br /><br />Opening a discourse (which of course she didn't realise she was doing - she thought she was performing solely for the entertainment of her coterie of admirers, and didn't pause to consider the potential repercussions of being overheard by the people she was talking about) in this strident and dismissive fashion was not, as it turned out, the best of diplomatic moves, and it meant that automatically people were going to respond with indignation at seeing their position misrepresented (along with the unflattering & not particularly watertight analogies). So right from the get go you've got people being rude to one another and feeling emotional, rather than concentrating upon the actual discussion at hand.<br /><br />As a feminist, I do find it quite saddening that this matter went down one way on the blog of a female writer (as a result of her own post), and very differently on the blog of a male writer - I really don't want to describe the former as more emotional and less consistent, damn it. But mad props to you, Mr Martin, for expressing your stance (which is essentially the same as Ms Gabaldon's) in such a measured and sensible fashion, and eschewing playing to the crowd or taking pot shots. It just makes it so much easier for a proper conversation to take place, and that's good for all involved.<br /><br />So, yes - thank you very much for setting the tone of the discussion, and for your considered responses. I've found it all much more useful and thought-provoking than the conversation in Ms Gabaldon's blog (which felt, at times, all too much like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs&amp;feature=related\">this</a>.

While I've never written fan fiction, I have read a lot of it. It never occurred to me until now to think that fan fiction might cause problems for the original author. <br /><br />In regard to the questions about fan art, Suvudu, etc. I personally feel there's a pretty distinct line between those and fan fiction. Fan art and things like the Suvudu cage matches seem to serve mostly to draw attention and interest to the original works while letting the readers feel like they're part of the action. Fan fiction is creating new works to draw attention, potentially (though certainly not always), away from the parent work. <br /><br />I also RP from time to time. I own a deeply cherished copy of the Game of Thrones RPG. I can see how RPing might border on fan fiction given that players may use characters from the books and - obviously - the setting from the books. However, for the most part, RPGs stay in the living room (or basement or dungeon) and the stories that develop from RPGs usually don't become published works.<br /><br />Thus, I feel fan fiction is really its own entity and given the points you've made I can understand why an author wouldn't be supportive of it.<br /><br />I'm glad that many authors have blogs running now to bring issues like this to light and present the other side.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"May 8 2010, 21:59:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://realorian.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"realorian","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"realorian","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://realorian.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"realorian","ctime_ts":1273355973,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/40434616/9272928","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9955592#t9955592","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9955592#t9955592","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9955592#t9955592","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"geek_domestic","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://geek-domestic.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9955592,"talkid":38889,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9955592#t9955592","upictitle":"geek_domestic: Remus/Sirius","article":"Goodness.

I haven't been paying any attention to the development of the fanfic genre so I appreciate the discussion.<br /><br />I, for one, don't get the whole idea of fanfic. Why take someone else's characters and worlds and write a story around them? Isn't it more fun creatively to write your own worlds and characters? Though I do see how it's essentially the same thing when you write for a show that's already established: The characters already exist as does their world. But I think there's a difference in writing stories about preexisting characters when you have the permission of the creator or owner instead of reading a book and wanting to write your own unauthorized stories about them. If you love the characters so much, figure out what you like about them, what you like about the world, and create something all your own.<br /><br />As a reader, I've chosen not to read fanfic because I don't want to read some random person's version of what they think an already beloved character would do. I don't want their ideas changing my thoughts about the original characters. <br /><br />And if people really want to write fiction online to share with the world, why can't all those people create worlds and characters together and write about them? Why do they need to borrow someone else's creations?<br /><br />I loved that cartoon you linked to btw. Very amusing and the reason I usually don't read many comments on any posts (news, blogs, etc) since so often people are wrong (or maybe it's that they just think the wrong way) :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"May 8 2010, 22:53:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"fanfic","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hokie256.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hokie256","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hokie256","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hokie256.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hokie256","ctime_ts":1273359217,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/88109431/1402780","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9963272#t9963272","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9963272#t9963272","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9963272#t9963272","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9963272#t9963272","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jonquil","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jonquil.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9963272,"talkid":38919,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9963272#t9963272","above":9958664,"upictitle":"Jonquil Serpyllum: pimpernel","article":"To begin with, I think that if a creator says \"Please don't write fanfic\", people shouldn't.  Period, end.<br /><br />&gt; And if people really want to write fiction online to share with the world, why can't all those people create worlds and characters together and write about them?<br /><br />This is a bit like asking, why don't county fair champions become professional bakers?   You can't justify a hobby.  A hobby does not exist to be useful or to appeal to anybody other than the hobbyist.   I spend some of my leisure time turning pixels on paper to embroidered pixels on fabric.  It ain't art.  Nobody ever asks me \"Why don't you design your own patterns?\" -- they just assume I like embroidery.<br /><br />Some fans enjoy playing \"Let's pretend\".  Just as we played \"Let's pretend Justice League/Star Trek/[insert your legend]\" as children, we do the same thing on paper as adults.  \"Let's pretend Star Trek\" is a different game from \"Let's pretend a space opera with aliens and spaceships and different cultures.\"   Part of the fun of fanfic fandom is playing \"let's pretend\" with other people, throwing ideas back and forth.  <br /><br />Some people who do this become published writers.   Most of the people who do it don't aim at being published writers.  It's not seen as a progression, as becoming a real rabbit.   \"Real writers don't play with other people's settings, they create their own!\"  Tell it to Steven Brust, Naomi Novik, Tom Stoppard, Jean Rhys, and all the people who've written Sherlock Holmes pastiches, published and not.<br /><br />Fanfiction is a form of play.   You can't explain why playing is fun; it either is for you, or it isn't.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","below":10026760,"ctime":"May 8 2010, 23:48:27

See, if you write a harmless fanfic and post it on your journal for your friends to read, you are not financially profiting from this. Plus, you still bought all the books that the author wrote. You'd still buy the books in the future, right? You can't write fanfiction without knowledge of a world ;] Good fanfic at least...<br /><br />Now, If you download a CD illegally, you're not paying the company or the artist for their work and probably won't buy the album in hard copy either. <br /><br />There's a whole other world for the legal issues of fanfiction, but I'm just talking about the majority of fiction. It's put out there for friends and other strange internet people to read. The majority of people don't want to piss off the author or steal money from him/her. They just want to have fun. <s>Unfortunately, sometimes that fun is going against what the creator deems appropriate and that's where the issues arise...</s>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"May 8 2010, 23:27:00 UTC","parent":9959176,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kodonaa.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kodonaa","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kodonaa","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kodonaa.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kodonaa","ctime_ts":1273361220,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9960712#t9960712","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9960712#t9960712","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9960712#t9960712","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9960712#t9960712","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"9fires","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://9fires.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9960712,"talkid":38909,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152072.html?thread=9960712#t9960712","upictitle":"9fires: pic#99687584","article":"I'm of a mind that fanfiction needs to go, much as remakes and reboots must, I'd compare they're artistic value to paint by numbers or those coloring books where the paper is impregnated with the paint, and all the user needs to do is run a wet brush around the page to color the picture in.<br /><br />I'm a writer and when I'm finished, I'll be an author and to this end I've sacrificed much... I've woken in the middle of the night in a cold sweat from nightmares of plagiarism or someone absconding with my characters - who (as you said yesterday, GRRM) are just as much my children as my children are my children. Of my blood or of my mind, they're mine and nobody gets to touch them except me.<br />Anyone who has sacrificed their lives to produce any sort of artistic endeavor is deserving of the protection of law, failing that, an armed cadre of legbreakers. <br /><br />So far we've talked about JPL, who I've never been a fan, but his influence is undeniable, I forward another - Gary Gygax, who utterly lost control of his own work and had to sit by while lesser individuals slaughtered his work and corrupted the original vision... If that ever happened to me, there'd be injuries. Grievous and mortal, inflicted with an axe. <br /><br />George I've a question - Is there not a legal recourse to follow to kneecap such sites as fanfiction.net? I understand that squarshing fanfiction is about futile as policing porn, but if you take out the venue, the band will head back to the garage, where only the neighbors have to listen to their crappy tunes.
