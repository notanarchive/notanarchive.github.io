{"itemid":1006,"subject":"Life is Meaningless...","event":"... at least for Jets fans.\r\n\r\nPfui.  What a terrible way to end the season, losing to the hated Dolphins.  With the season on the line, Mark Sanchez played an awful game, and Santonio Holmes failed to show.  \r\n\r\nOh, well.  It's \"wait till next year\" for Gang Green.  Rex is going to have to make a lot of off-season changes.  I still hold out hope that Sanchez can be the franchise qb we need, but the team needs to get back to the \"ground and pound\" attack of 2010 and (especially) 2009.  We may need another RB to pair with Shonn Green, especially if Tomlinson retires as he threatens.  Maybe Joe McKnight can fill that role, but I'm not sure.  And the D needs help as well.  A safety to take the place of Eric SMith, the weak spot in an otherwise outstanding secondary, and a kickass pass rusher / sack artist so Rex won't need to blitz so much.\r\n\r\nI suspect we'll have a new offensive coordinator as well, though I am not convinced that Shottenheimer was the problem.\r\n\r\nThe Dolphins played with a lot of heart, considering they had nothing to play for.  Must say, though, the number of empty seats in the stadium was shocking.  Almost the entire upper deck appeared empty.  That would never happen to a Jets or Giants game, no matter what the team's record was.  I know Florida fans have a bad rep for turning out only for winning teams...  certainly true for the Jaguars in the NFL, and for baseball's Marlins as well... but I'd thought better of Dolphins fans.  And the condition of the field was pretty shocking as well.  Torn up to hell and gone.  Players were slipping and tripping all afternoon, and there were big divots everywhere you looked.\r\n\r\nLet's hope the Giants can salvage some joy for me and the Big Apple tonight.

I'd start with getting rid of the owner.<br /><br />I believe that the changes in rules make \"ground and pound\" football obsolete. You need a passer. If you aren't going to give him a boss O-line then you have to be certain that he's mobile enough and football savvy enough and accurate enough to make up for that. Obviously Sanchez at this stage of his development wasn't. That could be due to poor coaching (no off-season didn't help) and lousy play design and calls. If they can give him decent protection he has the skilled position players to be a winning QB. <br /><br />The defense was pitiful. Especially since they have the best cornerback in the game. Rex doesn't have the players for the type of defense he has designed.<br /><br />Can Rex and Tannenbaum figure it out for next season?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"January 2 2012, 05:11:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1325481082,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/10590070/1338700","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/257584.html?thread=15178032#t15178032","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/257584.html?thread=15178032#t15178032","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/257584.html?thread=15178032#t15178032","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lucrezaborgia","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lucrezaborgia.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15178032,"talkid":59289,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/257584.html?thread=15178032#t15178032","upictitle":"Lucreza Borgia: pic#10590070","article":"I lived in Miami most of my life and moved to Green Bay 3 years ago.
