{"itemid":1872,"subject":"The Big Meow","event":"Meow Wolf opened \"The House of Eternal Return\" with a roar and a bang last week.\r\n\r\nWe had a \"small\" (hoo hah) friends and family 'soft opening' on Wednesday.  On Thursday was the Grand VIP Gala.  On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday the doors opened to the public for the first time.  Amanda Palmer, Jason Webley, and the Handsome Family played.  Wonders were unveiled, caves and treehouses and haunted mansions and space gates explored, refrigerators opened...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/348135/348135_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/348410/348410_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/348565/348565_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe reviews, I am thrilled to say, were uniformly raves.  Here's a few:  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/t-magazine/mystery-house-santa-fe-george-rr-martin.html?_r=0\r\n\r\nhttp://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/museum_shows/forever-home-meow-wolf-opens-house-of-eternal-return/article_4f72acf1-b0be-52d4-ad87-d8c48192ca78.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/meow-wolf-s-long-anticipated-exhibit-debuts-it-s-awesome/article_5110812e-cc53-54cb-b216-b2cf61c3ea91.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/meow-wolf-s-long-anticipated-exhibit-debuts-it-s-awesome/article_5110812e-cc53-54cb-b216-b2cf61c3ea91.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI am told that 5500 hundred people visited the House on its opening weekend.  Most of them went away smiling... especially the kids, who loved the place... but there's plenty there for adults to enjoy as well.\r\n\r\nOur hope is that Meow Wolf and the House of Eternal Return will be one of Santa Fe's premiere attractions for many, many years to come.  Come visit when you're in town.  I promise you, you've never seen anything quite like it.","ditemid":479342,"eventtime":"2016-03-21 01:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"ecstatic","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"artwork, santa fe, meow wolf","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Mar 21 22:51:39 2016]R [Mon Mar 21 22:51:40 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/712049064410361856 ","current_moodid":98,"commentalter":1465767803,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/712049064410361856","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.685147635697601]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1458600745}","revtime":1458670920},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-03-21 22:51:36","anum":110,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/479342.html","event_timestamp":1458522660,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/479342.html?replyto=24184174","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/479342.html?thread=24184174#t24184174","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/479342.html?thread=24184174#t24184174","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/479342.html?thread=24184174#t24184174","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aatishgopichand","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aatishgopichand.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24184174,"talkid":94469,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/479342.html?thread=24184174#t24184174","article":"Hi George,<br /><br />I just wanted to say thank you for creating ASOIAF.
