{"itemid":146,"subject":"Hugo Nominations Deadline","event":"Just a reminder -- less than a week remains to get in your Hugo nominations for this year.\r\n\r\nYou need to be a supporting or attending member of either the forthcoming worldcon, Denvention 3, or the past one, Nippon 2007, to nominate.  If you're not a member, however, it is easy enough to join, and supporting memberships -- for those who can't make the con -- are cheap enough.\r\n\r\nNominations can be made online at Denvention's website at \r\n\r\nhttp://www.denvention.org/hugos/index.php\r\n\r\nNominations must be in by SATURDAY, MARCH 1 to be counted.\r\n\r\nThese days there are dozens of different awards being given for SF, fantasy, and horror, and all of them are nice enough, to be sure, but the Hugo is the oldest and far and away the most important.  This is the one given by the READERS, not by some hand-picked jury, and the more people who participate in the process, the better.  Not enough people vote for the Hugos, sadly, and far fewer bother to nominate... which is a shame.  \r\n\r\nSo don't miss your chance to take part.  Go ye forth, nominate, vote.","ditemid":37559,"eventtime":"2008-02-24 13:55:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":192,"commentalter":1204741579,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","verticals_list":"culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-24 21:05:03","anum":183,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html","event_timestamp":1203861300,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/81676849/5867932","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?replyto=3542199","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3542199#t3542199","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3542199#t3542199","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3542199#t3542199","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"noctolator","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://noctolator.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3542199,"talkid":13836,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3542199#t3542199","upictitle":"noctolator: Emo Obama","article":"Is your voting a secret?

That's hardly a \"privileged few.\"<br /><br />And as far as the deadline goes, think of it as having to be registered to vote at least thirty days before Election Day.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 25 2008, 18:34:23 UTC","parent":3544759,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kevin_standlee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kevin_standlee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kevin_standlee","ctime_ts":1203964463,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117773677/10697211","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?replyto=3569847","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3569847#t3569847","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3569847#t3569847","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3569847#t3569847","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nekooflove","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nekooflove.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3569847,"talkid":13944,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3569847#t3569847","above":3556535,"upictitle":"nekooflove: Happy Cordy","article":"But I don't have to pay to vote for my government officials. <br />I am certainly not going to shell out $200 of my book money so I can claim membership to a convention that I will never afford to attend, or try to be in a society that I will never meet.<br />Reading is a wonderful escape for me into the realms of the imagination.

That's because \"paying membership dues\" is not one of the requirements for being a citizen of your country.  But WSFS isn't a country.  It's a club.  If you want to join a club, you have to meet that club's membership requirements.  Is this a difficult concept for you?<blockquote><em>I am certainly not going to shell out $200 of my book money so I can claim membership to a convention that I will never afford to attend, or try to be in a society that I will never meet.</em></blockquote>Well, it doesn't cost $200 to become a member of the World Science Fiction Society.  It costs (currently) $50.  It costs an additional $150 to attend WSFS's annual convention this year.  But from the way you're talking, I get the impression that <em>any</em> amount of money would be too much.  Is that correct?  Or would you be willing to join WSFS (not attend the convention; just join the society to get voting rights) for $20?  $10?  $1?<blockquote><em>...spending that money on a vote that may or may not have any influence or sway on the outcome.</em></blockquote>For your sake, I hope that none of the works you would like to see nominated fail to make the ballot by one vote.  I'm not joking, by the way.  I've administered the Hugo Awards three times.  The margins are actually quite small.  In 1993, there was a tie for Best Novel, and the winner in Best Semiprozine won by a single vote.  And it's not at all unusual for works to only make the ballot by one vote.  Any given vote may prove to be important.<br /><br />But of course, nobody <em>makes</em> you join WSFS.  But if you're not a member, you're not allowed to vote.  I don't know if you're a member of <em>any</em> clubs, or ever have been.  I don't know of many clubs that allow non-members to vote on anything important, and the Hugo Awards are one of the two most important things that WSFS members ever get to decide.  (Where to hold future Worldcons is the other one.)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","below":3570359,"ctime":"March 1 2008, 22:43:15 UTC","parent":3569847,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kevin_standlee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kevin_standlee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kevin_standlee","ctime_ts":1204411395,"tracked":0},{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"gridlore","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gridlore.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3570359,"talkid":13946,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3570359#t3570359","above":3570103,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","below":3570871,"parent":3569847,"massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gridlore.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gridlore","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gridlore","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gridlore.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"gridlore","ctime_ts":1204415353,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/48545222/4545815","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?replyto=3571127","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3571127#t3571127","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3571127#t3571127","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3571127#t3571127","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kevin_standlee","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3571127,"talkid":13949,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/37559.html?thread=3571127#t3571127","above":3570359,"upictitle":"Kevin Standlee: SMOF Zone","article":"Well, in fact you can vote without having to <em>prove</em> that you pay taxes, although it's pretty difficult to avoid doing so; therefore, I don't make that part of my argument.

miniatures.  I've got to say though that the fans of ASOIAF have great taste (well obviously or they wouldn't be GRRMs fans) because the top four are the ones I'd have chosen too - a nice balance of characters from the novels.<br /><br />But the reason behind my post is about ideas for the \"types\" - why do they all have to be spearcarriers or soldiers.  So here are a few of my ideas for types:<br /><br />Leaders/ sworn members of the Faith:  a septon, a septa, a silent sister, and a begging brother, a brown brother, a poor fellow, a warrior's son, even a knight as knighthood involves a religious ceremony.<br /><br />Leaders/ sworn members of other religions:  greenseer, Drowned God priest, a member of the Dosh Khaleen, a Red Priest/ Priestess, Priest of the Many-Faced God.<br /><br />Wildings: spearwife, a giant, a Thenn, a Hornfoot, a cave dweller, a nightrunner, a walrus man, a clan member of the ice rivers.<br /><br />Other general ideas for these characters are:  maester, alchemist, Master at Arms etc.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 28 2008, 03:18:40 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Actually not related to this subject - miniature ideas","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cochick.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cochick","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cochick","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cochick.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cochick","ctime_ts":1204168720,"tracked":0}]}
