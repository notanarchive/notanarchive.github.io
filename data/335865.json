Schmidt: pic#113139715","article":"While Lavonte David's hit on GS in Game 1 was in this case \"unnecessary\" due to the time situation and cost his team the game, it highlights a new issue rising with the influx of QBs who played the spread in college:  the QB who slows at the sideline and feigns going out of bounds and then lunges down the sideline for a few yards towards the first down marker.  We college FB fans have been seeing more of this every year, and now we see it imported into the pro game.  GS had already done so several times earlier in the game, so David (the Bucs' best defender--take a look at his stat line for the game--made the mental error.  He actually hit GS before GS had actually touched a foot out of bounds, but since THIS time GS was in the air over the line rather than lunging forward, he rightly got the flag.  But if those spread guys don't stop acting like RBs and trying to sneak the extra yards, we are going to be seeing more and more potentially dangerous sideline hits.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"September 13 2013, 19:49:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"QBs Running on the Sidelines","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002232235975","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Loren Schmidt","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_795683","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=41807578&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Loren Schmidt","ctime_ts":1379101777,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119901125/59452072","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/335865.html?thread=18204153#t18204153","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/335865.html?thread=18204153#t18204153","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/335865.html?thread=18204153#t18204153","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1606515","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/patrick.wagner.92317","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18204153,"talkid":71109,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/335865.html?thread=18204153#t18204153","upictitle":"Patrick Wagner: pic#119901125","article":"At this point in the season, who do you think will win the NFC East?
