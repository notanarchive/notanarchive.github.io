{"itemid":926,"subject":"A Taste of Cyanide","event":"Two of the game designers from Cyanide's studio in Montreal flew down to New Mexico on Friday to give me a look at their GAME OF THRONES RTS game (that's Real Time Strategy, for those of you who don't speak Gaming), which is now done and will be rolling out Real Soon Now.\r\n\r\nNow, I have to admit, I am far from being an expert on videogames.  In fact, I've never played any of the current RTS games.  My experience with videogaming was almost entirely with older, turn-based DOS strategy games like ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS, PIRATES, MASTER OF ORION, RAILROAD TYCOON, and the like.  And as you can probably tell from those titles, I stopped videogaming some years ago (not because I did not like it -- truth to tell, I liked it too much, and found that I was spending way too much time playing games on my computer when I should have been writing).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hdac6/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hdac6\" width=\"558\" height=\"170\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat being said... I thought what I saw looked really cool.  And Ty, who DOES play a lot of videogames, seemed impressed as well.  The gang at Cyanide (Montreal) have come up with some innovative features for this one, that should help make A GAME OF THRONES: GENESIS unlike any other RTS on the market at present.  And fun to play as well, we hope... but that's a verdict that will need to come from the gamers out there.\r\n\r\nFocus, our publisher, has opened an official website for GENESIS.  Check it out:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.agot-genesis.com/\r\n\r\n(Just to be clear.  This is the RTS game, designed and developed by Cyanide's studio in Montreal.  A second videogame, an RPG, is also under development at Cyanide's studio in France, but that one won't be along for a while yet.  The two games are very different, so please don't get them confused).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed having the crew from Cyanide down here, and liked what they had to show me.  I hope you will as well.","ditemid":237278,"eventtime":"2011-09-11 12:18:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"games","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1317092525,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1317155867},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-09-11 18:48:26","anum":222,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html","event_timestamp":1315743480,"reply_count":38,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126879586/30710952","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14638046#t14638046","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14638046#t14638046","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14638046#t14638046","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sikariy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sikariy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14638046,"talkid":57179,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14638046#t14638046","upictitle":"о мире, смысле жизни и вообще: pic#126879586","article":"we are waiting for the Dance with dragong in Russian edition!<br />thank you for your greatest book!

I don't normally comment on this stuff (although I do subscribe to your blog), but I've felt nervous about these games since they were announced, as have several other game industry folks I've talked to.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cyanide is not known for quality software. In fact, they are more often associated with \"shovel ware\" budget titles, that is created on a strict budget and with a strict timeline, but is rarely fun and often very buggy. Their business model works for them, which is great, but it does NOT often yield a \"good\" game. Which is a shame, because this is such a rich property that it's going to be a real tragedy if either (or more likely - both) of these games winds up being sub-par.\n\nGeorge - I hope that these games turn out to be great. I know I'll play them even though I have low expectations, but know that that is because of the IP, not because of the developers. I just hope that if my fears prove to be true that the poor sales and worse reviews don't scare you off from future QUALITY games with a new partner down the road.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"September 12 2011, 01:44:09 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Comment from a Game Developer","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://concerndgamedev.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"concerndgamedev","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"concerndgamedev","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://concerndgamedev.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"concerndgamedev","ctime_ts":1315791849,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/106370678/32560856","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14648798#t14648798","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14648798#t14648798","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14648798#t14648798","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_344304","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=603170019","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14648798,"talkid":57221,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/237278.html?thread=14648798#t14648798","above":14644190,"upictitle":"Peter Goranov: pic#106370678","article":"The cinematics are sub-par for today's standards and the promo trailer they've posted on their site has been done by an amateur in After Effects (the particles in the beginning and the rocks breaking at the end.
