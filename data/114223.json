{"itemid":446,"subject":"44-7","event":"That was the most complete Giants victory I have seen in years.  Almost total domination in every phase of play.  It would have been another shutout except for a Sinorice Moss fumble and a very bad call by the refs a few plays later, when a quick whistle (which no one heard) negated a Giants fumble recovery and touchdown.\r\n\r\nI'll say this for the Raiders, though.  They have a very good punter.\r\n\r\nThe NFL can be merciless.  It was only a few years ago the Raiders were playing in the Superbowl, but since then...\r\n\r\nJaMarcus Russell is no Rich Gannon.  He did manage to complete more than half of his passes today, in between getting sacked and losing fumbles.  Gods, what an awful quarterback.  And the rumor is that Zombie Al won't let the coaches bench him.\r\n\r\nEli had a perfect passer rating.  Even David Carr looked good.  And Mario Manningham and Hakeem Nicks both played great games.  Our young wideouts are really coming along.  And the running game looked great today.\r\n\r\nOf coursse, the real test will be next week, when the G-Men face the undefeated Saints.","ditemid":114223,"eventtime":"2009-10-11 16:21:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":191,"taglist":"nfl","commentalter":1255496927,"personifi_tags":"35:7,45:3,10:3,11:14,37:25,3:18,25:11,4:11,39:14,9:18,21:7,13:48"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-10-11 22:30:21","anum":47,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html","event_timestamp":1255278060,"reply_count":51,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/81733719/731384","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?replyto=7731759","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7731759#t7731759","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7731759#t7731759","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7731759#t7731759","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"infinite_hiatus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7731759,"talkid":30202,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7731759#t7731759","upictitle":"Tyson: SOIAF","article":"beat the saints!  beat the saints!  beat the saints!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"October 11 2009, 22:42:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"as a Falcons fan, I would just like to say","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"infinite_hiatus","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"infinite_hiatus","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"infinite_hiatus","ctime_ts":1255300939,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/46721543/2854335","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?replyto=7732271","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7732271#t7732271","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7732271#t7732271","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7732271#t7732271","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kalimac","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kalimac.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7732271,"talkid":30204,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114223.html?thread=7732271#t7732271","upictitle":"Kalimac: puzzle","article":"\"They have a very good punter.\"<br /><br />That's the good news (for them).
