He's game, but I have to head out in a half hour or so, to enjoy cocktails on a mesa.\r\n\r\nYou nailed Lord Karstark, though, so here as a reward are two more recent castings for HBO's second season of GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nAs Ygritte, we have the lovely ROSE LESLIE, kissed by fire.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hrw6w/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hrw6w\" width=\"360\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRose is best known for her role in the first season of DOWNTON ABBEY, the British miniseries that scored big at this year's Emmies.
