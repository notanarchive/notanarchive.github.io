The reason given was bad weather in Chicago.  If and when she takes off, she may or may not make her Dublin connection at O'Hare.  The key there is whether ALL the flights are being delayed, or just some.  She had two hours to make that connection, but of course the delays have eaten up that cushion.\r\n\r\nI know some of her Irish friends read this LJ.  I'll let you know the latest when I hear from her... but be advised, she may not be showing up on schedule.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I'm still here, still holding down the fort, working on DANCE, on Vance, on WARRIORS, on WILD CARDS.","ditemid":45351,"eventtime":"2008-06-09 16:44:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":152,"current_moodid":85,"commentalter":1213336110},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-06-09 22:49:33","anum":39,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html","event_timestamp":1213029840,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/54923263/1696117","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?replyto=3926311","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926311#t3926311","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926311#t3926311","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926311#t3926311","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"joy_of_saturn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://joy-of-saturn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3926311,"talkid":15337,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926311#t3926311","article":"We have been having some crazy bad weather here in Chicago.","upictitle":"♥ Grace ♥: lotus","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"8 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"June 9 2008, 22:56:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://joy-of-saturn.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"joy_of_saturn","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"joy_of_saturn","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://joy-of-saturn.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"joy_of_saturn","ctime_ts":1213052167,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/7056549/97478","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?replyto=3926567","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926567#t3926567","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926567#t3926567","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926567#t3926567","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"madbard","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://madbard.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3926567,"talkid":15338,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926567#t3926567","upictitle":"Popular series of fiction, fancy, and fact.: Benevolent sense of life","article":"(You almost had a nice rhyme scheme going there.)<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"June 9 2008, 22:56:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://madbard.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"madbard","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"madbard","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://madbard.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"madbard","ctime_ts":1213052178,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/36188682/824471","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?replyto=3926823","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926823#t3926823","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926823#t3926823","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926823#t3926823","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"snaidvooar","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://snaidvooar.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3926823,"talkid":15339,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/45351.html?thread=3926823#t3926823","upictitle":"Rick: Soot","article":"It has been raining all day here in Chicago, so I would bet that most everything is delayed at O'Hare.
