That said, I hasten to add that my intent in writing to you is to offer some encouragement.<br />\tI recently joined Facebook, and I saw a group there called the “George RR Martin Labor Encouragement Force”.  Thinking it was a fan-group with a clever name, I “lurked”.  These people are angry, sir.  There’s no other adjective for it.  <br />        I thought that if this was representative of the kind of feedback you’ve been getting, you’d be due a break.  I have only paid peripheral attention to the publication history of the books, but as I understand it, you produced the first three more or less on your own schedule.  These were outstanding books.  Then, due to time-pressure, you made the decision to split the next two -- and Feast for Crows suffered from the split.  The writing was still there, but it didn’t have the careful pacing of the others.  <br />        Part of me quails at my presumption, but the rest is consoled with the knowledge that I am not alone in my assessment.<br />        So instead of pleading with you to finish Dance with Dragons, I wanted to write and say:<br />        Please, sir, take your time.  As long as you finish the story and the books kick ass, I will be patient.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 8 2009, 21:50:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Just this to say . . .","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://pyppon.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"pyppon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"pyppon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://pyppon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"pyppon","ctime_ts":1234129836,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121645464/16846061","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/70070.html?replyto=5260726","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/70070.html?thread=5260726#t5260726","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/70070.html?thread=5260726#t5260726","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/70070.html?thread=5260726#t5260726","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kevinsansone","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kevinsansone.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5260726,"talkid":20549,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/70070.html?thread=5260726#t5260726","upictitle":"Kevin: 2013","article":"Since I know you from Wild Cards and not ASOIAF it was good to hear about the past of wild cards and yourself during that time.
