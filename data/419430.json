{"itemid":1638,"subject":"One Nice Night","event":"I felt strongly that I had to speak up about Puppygate, and I have.  I am glad I did.  But do not think for a moment that I've enjoyed it.  Though I have done my best to keep the discussion civil, there's still a whiff of venom in the air.  (You should see some of the comments I've deleted).  It gives one a headache.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, it's nice sometimes to restore one's faith in humanity, and I did some of that last night at my theatre.  Magician Francis Menotti was performing at the Cocteau, and I went down to catch his act.  Francis was wonderfully entertaining, and the crowd was great too.  Old people, young people, kids, black people and white people and brown people, men and women, all ooohing and aaahing at the magic and laughing at the jokes, enjoying adult beverages (well, not the children) like our famous Burning Tumblewheel and our new White Walkers.  They all came out smiling, and lots of them stopped afterwards in the bar to chat with me and Francis.  One young couple were making their first visit to Santa Fe; they had just gotten engaged, and the two of them were bright-eyed and excited and glowing.  Made me feel good just to meet them.\r\n\r\nThat's what worldcons used to be like.  Should be like.  Could be like again.\r\n\r\nLast night restored my faith in people, a little.  It's not fandom that's toxic.  It's the internet.","ditemid":419430,"eventtime":"2015-04-12 13:38:00","props":{"current_mood":"tired","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, everyday life, fandom","current_moodid":31,"commentalter":1429030970,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" One Nice Night http://j.mp/1aVL4wQ","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.679837860618233]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428867489}","revtime":1429077080},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-12 19:37:36","anum":102,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html","event_timestamp":1428845880,"reply_count":48,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20995942#t20995942","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20995942#t20995942","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20995942#t20995942","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"baackdragon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://baackdragon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20995942,"talkid":82015,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20995942#t20995942","article":"Glad to see your faith in people has been some what restored","upictitle":"baackdragon: pic#0","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"2 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"April 12 2015, 19:45:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"faith in people","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://baackdragon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"baackdragon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"baackdragon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://baackdragon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"baackdragon","ctime_ts":1428867927,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124820130/75157546","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20996454#t20996454","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20996454#t20996454","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20996454#t20996454","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20996454#t20996454","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jalice42","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jalice42.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20996454,"talkid":82017,"etime_ts":"1428868293","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=20996454#t20996454","upictitle":"jalice42: pic#124820130","article":"We recently got married ourselves and are really enjoying our trip to Santa Fe.

It transformed society from being separate communities of a few thousand or so to a united public forum where millions of ideas, thoughts, and opinions can be given at a moment's notice and seen by anyone.<br /><br />And while this has made society leap and bound forward that it's ever been, it also has no way of making the mountains of information on every subject digestible to the average consumer. Someone dedicated to these events like Puppygate have to trudge through hours and hours of people's views and opinions and the reactions to them and the reactions to the reactions and on and on and on.<br /><br />It doesn't make anything better when the practice of dividing people into \"us or them\" only further confuses the issues at hand with vitriolic sludge. It's not just exhausting to people involved, but the sheer size of the mountain newcomers have to climb in order to stay on top of the discussion being had is extremely intimidating. <br /><br />But there's mountains of issues and discussions just like this everywhere. In fact, the majority of creations requires a severe amount of dedication in order to make it a reality. The difference is that the internet allows everyone to see the discussions without the efficiency of summarizing the points and counter-points being made.<br /><br />But the result of these mountains will almost always bring people together to enjoy the medium. For example, years of people's lives have gone into helping the creation of Game of Thrones and the mountain behind THAT overshadows PuppyGate by leagues.<br /><br />I'm 100% positive the end result of Puppygate and the issues being discussed will be enjoyed by hundreds of thousands.

It's the internet.</i><br /><br />There have been toxic people in fandom for years. Perhaps you have not been subjected to men proclaiming ideas like Vox Day's at a con. The first time I was subjected to it was in...gosh, '87?...at Disclave, long before the Internet was a big factor. I thought the guy was doing some sort of bizarro modern Gorean thing as a joke and then realized he was serious. It wasn't the last time by a long shot. It's not just randoms either - there's notables such as Dave Sim, creator of the graphic novel Cerberus, who has written at length about his feelings about women (to quote: \"The Female Void devours the Male Light.\" There's thousands of words more but that sums up his feelings.)<br /><br />The Internet has allowed toxic people to find like-minded people and thus have their toxic ideas validated, often by people who are hundreds or thousands of miles away. People who, in person, do not have the sort of charisma or personality to make their voices heard have more ability to grab attention on the Internet. And the easiest way to grab attention is through bad language, hyperbolic statements and death threats. It worked on talk radio and it works on the Internet too. Your writings on Puppygate garnered a lot of attention due to your status and social capital; without it such well-reasoned and even-handed writing would have likely been drowned out by the shouting of the toxic people.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 12 2015, 21:53:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tafkarfanfic.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tafkarfanfic","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tafkarfanfic","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tafkarfanfic.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"tafkarfanfic","ctime_ts":1428875599,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/118901906/52767599","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=21009254#t21009254","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=21009254#t21009254","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=21009254#t21009254","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=21009254#t21009254","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1418250","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/jo.bird.182","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21009254,"talkid":82067,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419430.html?thread=21009254#t21009254","upictitle":"Jo Bird: pic#118901906","article":"Vox Day is offering an open and honest debate.

inconsiderate drivers. It's not the highway's fault, though, that some people misuse the roads. Highways can be wonderful things that take you to amazing places and expose you to new ideas.<br /><br />Speaking of highways, I first fell in love with Santa Fe on a solo road trip from Michigan in 2002 or so. I thought, \"this is a city I could live in.\" There aren't many such places for me and it has had that effect on a lot of people, from what I understand. My girlfriend and I will be visiting in June and the Jean Cocteau is a major attraction on our itinerary. We will be having a few White Walkers, I'm sure. Then we are off to Arches and the Grand Canyon, which she has never seen.<br /><br />Without highways, both literal and metaphoric, this trip would be a whole lot different.
