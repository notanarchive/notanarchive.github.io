{"itemid":1562,"subject":"Heinlein at the Cocteau","event":"They used to call Robert A. Heinlein &quot;the Dean of Science Fiction.&quot;&nbsp; For writers and readers of my geneation, and those before, Heinlein was a towering figure, the most important and influential of the &#39;Big Three&#39; of the Golden Age.\r\n\r\nThe first SF book I ever read was Heinlein&#39;s classic juvenile, HAVE SPACE SUIT, WILL TRAVEL.&nbsp;&nbsp; It made me a SF reader for life.&nbsp; For decades thereafter, RAH was my favorite writer.&nbsp; He was the first writer to win the &#39;Big One&#39; -- the Hugo Award for best novel -- four times.&nbsp; (A record later equalled, but still never surpassed).&nbsp;&nbsp; But like many of his contemporaries, Heinlein did some of his best work at shorter lengths.\r\n\r\n&quot;All You Zombies&quot; is one of those classic short stories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like time travel yarns?&nbsp; Time paradoxes?&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;All You Zombies&quot; was... is... will remain <b><i>THE </i></b>last word on all those subjects.&nbsp; And now, improbably, it has been made into a movie.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"530\" />\r\n\r\nPREDESTINATION opens this week at the Jean Cocteau.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t seen it, but those who have (friends from Australia, where the film opened last summer) tell me that it&#39;s 1) quite good, and 2) quite faithful to the Heinlein story.\r\n\r\nMust admit, I don&#39;t much like the title.&nbsp; I can see why they changed it -- &quot;All You Zombies&quot; would have had people thinking it was a George Romero picture or a WALKING DEAD ripoff, when actually the use of &#39;zombie&#39; is entirely metaphorical -- but I wish they would have changed it to something a bit catchier.\r\n\r\nBut a rose by any other name... I am looking forward to this one.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a Heinlein fan, or a time travel fan, don&#39;t miss it.\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies.\r\n\r\n(No spoilers in the comments, please).","ditemid":400085,"eventtime":"2015-01-05 18:57:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, movies, sf","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1420921265,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Heinlein at the Cocteau http://j.mp/1vVWV0j","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.66774476069309]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1420509466}","revtime":1421348023},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-01-06 01:57:32","anum":213,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400085.html","event_timestamp":1420484220,"reply_count":20,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/7244050/1019731","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400085.html?thread=20050901#t20050901","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400085.html?thread=20050901#t20050901","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400085.html?thread=20050901#t20050901","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tully01","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tully01.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20050901,"talkid":78323,"etime_ts":"1420512736","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400085.html?thread=20050901#t20050901","upictitle":"Tully: danger","article":"HAVE SPACE SUIT was my first RAH exposure too.
