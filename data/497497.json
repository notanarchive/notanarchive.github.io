What the hell happened to August?\r\n\r\nOh, I remember... a week of meetings in LA, a week at worldcon, Bubonicon, house guests and visitors, business meetings... damn...\r\n\r\nI wanted to blog about worldcon and the Hugo Awards and the Alfies and an <i><b>EPIC</b></i> Hugo Losers Party and the presidential election and HIGH STAKES and a very special week we have planned at the Jean Cocteau and lots of other stuff, and maybe I still will in the days to come, but right at the moment I am too tired.  Some of that stuff already seems like ages ago.  And I have lots to catch up on.\r\n\r\nBut it's been a while, so I thought I should at least say hi, and wave, and let everyone know that I'm still here, back at the old homestead and back at work.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to give a shout out to Ogre Jenni, who, alas, has left the Jean Cocteau and Fevre River to accept a full-time teaching job.  That's great news for Jenni, and all the kids that she will be teaching in the years to come, but sad news for us.  Jenni was terrific, a wonderful member of our crew here, and we miss her lots already.   At least she is still in town, so we will get to see her socially from time to time.

I thought it had doubled, but you didn't think it had gone up that much. Looking at the actual numbers, Novel, Novella, and Short Story more than doubled. Novelette almost doubled (up 92%).<br /><br />The truth is, fans nominated their hearts out this year, but it didn't make any difference. In fact, we lost ground because the slates also doubled their numbers, and the mathematics that govern the old voting system would have required fan nominations go up by a factor of 4 just to stay even. If the slates had played their cards right, they could have swept all but two categories and filled the rest with trash. Imagine a ceremony where \"No Award\" was given in all but two categories! Only the stupidity of the people running the slates saved us. By nominating some worthwhile works and some works by people who declined the nomination, they left us enough breathing room to actually have an awards ceremony worthy of the name.<br /><br />We can't count on the slates to continue to be stupid, nor can we expect fans to increase nominations by a further factor of 10 or more, which is what it would take to defeat the slates through sheer weight of numbers (assuming the slates cannot increase their numbers). EPH has its problems, but it will forever protect us from the threat of an awards ceremony with no awards.<br /><br />It was good to meet you in person, and I appreciated your kind words about Rocket Stack Rank. Even with EPH the system depends on strong fan participation, and we still see an important role for promoting short fiction.
