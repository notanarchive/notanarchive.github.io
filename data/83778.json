{"itemid":327,"subject":"Maurice Druon, RIP","event":"French novelist, historian, and World War II resistance fighter Maurice Druon has died at 90.  He lived a pretty extraordinary life.  You can read his obit here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/world/europe/16druon.html\r\n\r\nI never had the honor of meeting M. Druon, and I have not even read all of his work (yet).  But I am a huge fan of his best known novels, the wonderful \"Accursed Kings\" series of historical novels.  I have often said that my own SONG OF ICE AND FIRE was inspired as much by historical fiction as by fantasy, and Druon's series was one of my major inspirations (along with the work of other favorites like Thomas B. Costain, Mika Waltari, Bernard Cornwell, and many more).  The ACCURSED KINGS is great stuff.  Philip the Fair, the Curse of the Templars, the end of the Capetians and the roots of the Hundred Years War... I don't read French, but even in translation these are great reads.  (Although I don't believe the last volume has ever been published in English, which some publisher should rectify).\r\n\r\nEvery writer hopes that he will still be read after his death.  Here's your chance to make M. Druon's dream come true, and do yourself a favor at the same time.  Go off to ebay or ABE books and find yourself a copy of THE IRON KING, the first volume of the series.  You won't regret it.","ditemid":83778,"eventtime":"2009-04-17 00:38:00","props":{"current_moodid":25,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1242543142,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-04-17 06:48:59","anum":66,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/83778.html","event_timestamp":1239928680,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/104816797/3697176","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/83778.html?replyto=5925954","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/83778.html?thread=5925954#t5925954","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/83778.html?thread=5925954#t5925954","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/83778.html?thread=5925954#t5925954","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"arthegarn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://arthegarn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5925954,"talkid":23148,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/83778.html?thread=5925954#t5925954","upictitle":"Arthegarn: pic#104816797","article":"<i>Quand un Roi perd la France</i> is clearly a later addition (I would call it an <i>estrambote</i>), in a different style, and in my opinion is to the saga as <i>The Phantom Menace</i> was to <i>Star Wars</i>, but the first six books are really entangling.

It is a fascinating period of our history, so I guess that it also adds to the story ^^<br /><br />As for the Académie Française, it is important because French is such a tricky language - lots of grammar points, lots of expressions. I write in French very well and I still learn/relearn points every month or so - I am the kind of people who is unbearably perfectionist though. <br />Because, it's not because people think that something is written one way that it's true. The most peculiar example would be \"Au temps pour moi\" that people most often write \"Autant pour moi\" which is simply wrong (but you pronounce it the same way and the second could make sense, sooooo...).
