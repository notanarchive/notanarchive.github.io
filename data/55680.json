{"itemid":217,"subject":"Get Out and Vote","event":"Parris and I voted on Tuesday.  Big turnout here in Santa Fe for early voting.  Good.\r\n\r\nIf any of you reading this live in a state that offers early voting, I urge you strongly to go and vote NOW.  The crowds on election day are likely to be large, which could mean long lines, confusion, waiting.  Take advantage of early voting.  It will help ease the crush, and make things easier for all concerned... especially you.","ditemid":55680,"eventtime":"2008-10-23 11:27:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":76,"opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":126},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-10-23 17:31:59","anum":128,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/55680.html","event_timestamp":1224761220,"reply_count":0}
