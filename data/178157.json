{"itemid":695,"subject":"Digging Out","event":"Crawling slowly back to health... and sentience...\r\n\r\nThe two Giants games I watched yesterday did not help.  Gak.  Gak.  Life is meaningless and filled with pain.  The Manning Bowl was a horror, and the Titans game, if anything, was worse.  I have never seen a team shoot themselves in the foot so much.  They should have won the game by 30 points, the way the offense was moving, but mistakes and bone-headed penalties did them in.  I can't believe my beloved G-Men are leading the league in turnovers.  Tom Coughlin needs to bring out the chainsaw and rip a few new ones...\r\n\r\nHaven't watched the Jets/ Dolphins yet.  I'll get to that tonight, and then I will be caught up... at least on football.\r\n\r\nToday, meanwhile, I have to take an axe and start hacking at the mountain of stuff that has accumulated while I was gone.
