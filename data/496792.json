Development will begin immediately on what we hope will be the first of several interlocking series.   Melinda M. Snodgrass, my assistant editor and right-hand man on Wild Cards since its inception, the creator of Dr. Tachyon, Double Helix, and Franny Black, and a seasoned television writer/ producer whose credits include STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION (\"Measure of a Man\"), REASONABLE DOUBTS, THE PROFILER, and STAR COMMAND, is attached as an executive producer on the project, together with Gregory Noveck of RED, Slow Learner, and SyFy Films \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/377283/377283_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/377554/377554_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/377733/377733_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nUCP creates innovative and critically acclaimed television and digital content across various media platforms for domestic and international distribution.

Of those infected, 90% died horribly, drawing the black queen, 9% were twisted and deformed into jokers, while a lucky 1% became blessed with extraordinary and unpredictable powers and became aces.  The world was never the same.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the Wild Cards series was published in 1986, and was a finalist for that year's Hugo Award, ultimately losing to Alan Moore's WATCHMEN. Twenty-two volumes have been published to date, with a twenty-third (HIGH STAKES) scheduled for hardcover release later this month, and three more in the works.  Translations and reprints of many of the Wild Cards books and stories have been published around the globe, in France, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, Russia, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom.  Comic books, graphic novels, and role-playing games have also chronicled the adventures of the aces and jokers of the WC universe.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/378643/378643_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/378945/378945_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/379161/379161_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nGenerations of writers, from bold new voices to visionary grand masters, have contributed to the Wild Cards universe over the past three decades.

There are thousands of stories to be told in the world of the Wild Cards, and Gregory and Melinda and UPC hope to be able to tell many of them.\r\n\r\nWhich stories will be adapted?  Which characters will be featured?  Hard to say at this early stage.  Let's see... we have Jetboy, the Four Aces, Dr. Tachyon, the Great and Powerful Turtle, Modular Man, Yeoman, Wraith, Cap'n Trips, Fortunato, Puppetman, Chrysalis, Popinjay, the Oddity, Father Squid, Water Lily, Sewer Jack, Bagabond, Peregrine, Carnifex, Infamous Black Tongue, Bugsy, Curveball, Earth Witch, Cameo, Elephant Girl, Demise, Ramshead, Mackie Messer, Mr. Nobody, Double Helix, the Amazing Bubbles, Stuntman, Rustbelt, Lohengrin, Hoodoo Mama, Drummer Boy, Abigail the Understudy, the Midnight Angel, and many many <i><b>MANY</b></i> more.  Which ones will you see?  I don't know.  Which ones do you <i><b>want </b></i>to see?  Tell us below, in the comments.  I am sure that Melinda and Gregory and UPC will be listening.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing I can say for (almost) sure.  You will be seeing Croyd Crenson, no matter shape the eventual show or shows ends up taking.  It wouldn't be Wild Cards without the Sleeper.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/380196/380196_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/380492/380492_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/380859/380859_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nSo there it is.  I hope you're as excited as I am.  Of course, Hollywood is Hollywood, and nothing is ever certain in development... but I think I hope I cross my fingers that the Wild Cards will be coming to your home screens in the next year or two.   \r\n\r\nI won't be working on the series myself... my own development deal is exclusive to HBO, and I am writing THE WINDS OF WINTER, as I believe most of you will recall... but I have every confidence in Melinda Snodgrass and Gregory Noveck.   They know and love the Wild Cards universe <i><b>almost</b></i> as well as I do, and I think they will do a terrific job.  Wish them luck.\r\n\r\n((And be sure to come to the Wild Cards Cage Matchs at worldcon, and snap up HIGH STAKES when it hits the stands later this month)).\r\n\r\nClear skies and tailwinds, as Jetboy would say.\r\n\r\n((<i><b>Please stay on topic in your comments.

After the shambles which was the HEROES reboot (and, really, everything after season 1 of that show), it'd be nice to see a different take on superheroes on TV. The closest that's around right now is POWERS, based on the Bendis and Oeming comic, and that's limited to the Sony Playstation streaming network... and has a very small budget by the looks of the clips and stills.<br /><br />Having recently binged STRANGER THINGS (which you may enjoy George, if you haven't seen it, provided you'd enjoy a sort of Spielberg-meets-Stephen-King circa the 80s homage/pastiche), it feels like the time is right to do something that starts as a period piece... so, though it's unoriginal, I'd love to see the  cast and story lines of the initial WILD CARDS novels. Start with Jetboy and Tachyon, take it into the 80s, go from there.<br /><br />I suppose you could shift things forward (and doubtless there are strong arguments for having a more contemporary setting), but the popularity and success of STRANGER THINGS makes me think viewers won't balk at watching a show set 30-odd years in the past if it's compelling enough.<br /><br

I've been a fan of Wild Cards pretty much from the start. I love both the old and the new books, but my preference would be for all the books to be adapted, starting with the old ones. I have a soft spot for the \"original\" books and characters.<br /><br />It's funny because, for a long time, I thought Wild Cards was impossible to adapt. But things have progressed in ways to make it possible.<br /><br />We have a Golden Age of television with many high-concept TV shows, many of them including sex and violence the likes we never could see in older shows (and Wild Cards needs a bit of a free reign on both for authenticity). We have superheroes becoming enough of a pop culture juggernaut so that the deconstructive takes like Wild Cards are finally understandable to the public. We even have Stranger Things and other shows proving that you CAN have a show set in the 1980s and 1990s and make it successful.<br /><br />The only thing I'm afraid of is that a lot of the grandeur and scale of Wild Cards may be a bit too much for a TV show. Book One alone has lots of aerial battles, the Four Aces travelling all over the world, hundreds of jokers, period recreations of the 1940s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s... and many crowd scenes, particularly the first Wild Card Day, Mark Meadows going to rock shows and campus protests in the 1960s, and the Riot in Jokertown. It may be too much for a TV show's budget. And if we get to Book 2, then we have the Swarm Invasion and the Great Ape.<br /><br />Of course, we also have many stories that would be cheaper to produce and possible on a TV budget. The Sleeper, Fortunato, and Yeoman mostly have the sort of urban crime stories that should not be overtly expensive. And the old cast of characters includes lots of psionic characters that would make special effects cheaper than the more physically-oriented Committee aces.<br /><br />In any case, I'm super-excited for this. Congrats to you and to all Wild Cards writers.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 months ago","ctime":"August 7 2016, 15:27:45 UTC","parent":24885656,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://renepavan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"renepavan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"renepavan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://renepavan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"renepavan","ctime_ts":"1470583665","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117094227/2289645","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24886680#t24886680","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24886680#t24886680","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24886680#t24886680","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jere7my","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24886680,"talkid":97213,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24886680#t24886680","upictitle":"jere7my: Glasses","article":"Excellent news.

I also like Takis.  <br /><br />Also congrats, you got me to log into livejournal after many, many years away.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 months ago","ctime":"August 7 2016, 01:04:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://iam-meno-tyou.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"iam_meno_tyou","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"iam_meno_tyou","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://iam-meno-tyou.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"iam_meno_tyou","ctime_ts":"1470531850","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126381905/78288404","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24887704#t24887704","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24887704#t24887704","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24887704#t24887704","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3773479","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153149765736358/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24887704,"talkid":97217,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24887704#t24887704","upictitle":"Drew Bittner: pic#126381905","article":"First off, congratulations!

Things might get complicated if they include that character who has the same name that I do in real life.  <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 months ago","ctime":"August 7 2016, 14:01:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Are special effects up to it?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ADragonDemands","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2902334","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73354478&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ADragonDemands","ctime_ts":"1470578513","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24893080#t24893080","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24893080#t24893080","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24893080#t24893080","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"renepavan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://renepavan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24893080,"talkid":97238,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/496792.html?thread=24893080#t24893080","above":24891544,"upictitle":"Rene Narciso: pic#0","article":"I always thought Doctor Tachyon was sort of a deconstruction of the Doctor (from Doctor Who).
