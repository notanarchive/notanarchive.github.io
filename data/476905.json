{"itemid":1862,"subject":"Nomination Time","event":"Hugo nominations are now open... but they will close at the end of the month.  I finally received my PIN number from MidAmericon II, so I am busy filling out my ballot.  If you're eligible to nominate, you should do the same.  No good reason to put it off till the last day, even if you have not finished your reading.  Fill in the things you know you want to nominate now, today, this minute.  You can come back and add more, or delete, or replace, or change later on.  As many times as you want.  The nominations won't count until the ballot is closed.\r\n\r\nAs to <i><b>what</b></i> to nominate... your call entirely, of course.\r\n\r\nI have been sharing my own thoughts and recommendations here in a series of blog posts, all of which you can find downstream by going back to \"older posts.\"  Been doing that category by category, wherever I had something to say.  (Which does not include every category).\r\n\r\nToday I wanted to say a few words about the three short fiction categories.  Short Story,  Novelette.  Novella.  Three of the oldest and most storied categories, with a distinguished lineage dating back to the days when the magazines were the heart of the field, and short fiction was still the place where the rising stars of SF and fantasy broke in and made their names, competing with the giants of previous generations for these prizes.  That's less true now than it used to be... but there's still some validity to it, and the three short fiction categories remain, to my mind, among the most important and prestigious Hugos.  (I should say right here that I cannot pretend to be objective about these categories, since I am a past winner of rockets in all three of them.  It is only the Big One, the novel, that has eluded me).\r\n\r\nLast year, however, these three categories were among those most impacted by Puppygate.  The slates dominated all three, sweeping the board and shutting out all other work.  In the novelette category, a disqualification allowed one non-Puppy nominee to squeeze onto the ballot, and that story ultimately won.  In novella and short story, fans unhappy with the choices presented them voted No Award.  Understandably, IMNSHO... still, it was not a happy ending.  There was some wonderful and powerful work published in these categories in 2014, and it was a shame that none of it could be recognized.  (I was proud and pleased to present Alfie Awards to Ursula Vernon for \"Jackalope Wives\" in short story, and to Patrick Rothfuss for \"The Slow Regard of Silent Things\" in novella... but we all know that an Alfie is not a Hugo, and in an ordinary year both Vernon and Rothfuss would surely have been contending for a rocket).\r\n\r\nThat's last year, however.  No amount of rehashing can change what happened.  The important thing is to see that it does not happen again.  And to that end, it behooves all of us to nominate the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that we enjoyed most last year... to share our thoughts with our friends... to shout our recommendations from the rooftops.   Let's make sure this year's shortlists truly represent the best of what was published in 2015.\r\n\r\nAs to my own recommendations...\r\n\r\nAh, there I hit a problem.  I am not making any recommendations in these categories.  Problem is, I have a conflict of interest.  As a writer I did not publish any original short fiction in 2015, true.  As an editor, however... well, Gardner Dozois and I co-edited an anthology called OLD VENUS that came out last year, and in my (admittedly less than objective) view, that book contained several stories that are worthy of Hugo nominations, and one that is so bloody brilliant that I think it stands right up there with any story that ever won the Hugo.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/340917/340917_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nI really can't tell you which one it is, however.  Or the names of the other stories in the book that I think worthy of consideration.  Look, Gardner and I liked <i><b>all</b></i> the stories we included in OLD VENUS.  If we hadn't, we would not have purchased them (and we do reject stories for every one of our anthologies).  But we'd be lying if we said we liked all of them equally.  There are stories Gardner liked more than I did; there are stories I liked more than Gardner did; there are stories both of us loved, loved, loved.  As editors, however, it would be unethical for us to say which were which in public.  Just as parents need to maintain devoutly that they love all their children equally and have no favorites, it behooves the ethical editor to take a similar stance toward the stories they purchase and publish.\r\n\r\nSo in the end all I can really say is that Gardner and I are both very proud of OLD VENUS, that we think there's some stuff in it worthy of your consideration, and that we hope you will agree.\r\n\r\nFor that, of course, you need to read the book.  I can make that a little easier, at least.  As it happens we have about forty (40) hardcover copies of OLD VENUS, autographed by both Gardner and myself, in stock at the Jean Cocteau Cinema bookstore.  We also have some copies of the companion volume OLD MARS, though that was published a year earlier, so nothing in it is eligible for a Hugo.  From now until the end of the month, we will offer a 30% discount off cover price on both OLD VENUS and OLD MARS.  http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/film/jean-cocteau-cinema-bookstore/\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/341011/341011_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/341342/341342_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/341683/341683_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n(And as long as I'm discounting, we'll also offer discounts on the hardcover WHEEL OF TIME COMPANION, signed by all its editors, and the trade paperback of THE MARTIAN, signed by Andy Weir.  Weir is a leading candidate for the Campbell Award this year and THE MARTIAN is almost sure to be a nominee in Dramatic Presentation/ Long Form, while the WHEEL OF TIME book deserves a nomination in Best Related Work).\r\n\r\nReturning once more to the Hugo Awards and the three short fiction categories... yes, of course, there was plenty of great stuff published last year outside of OLD VENUS.  And there are plenty of recommendation lists available on the web where you can find lists of what other fans, pros, and critics thought outstanding.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest and best of those is the LOCUS recommended reading list, which you can find here:\r\nhttp://www.locusmag.com/News/2016/02/2015-locus-recommended-reading-list/\r\n\r\nThe Nebula Awards are often a precursor to the Hugos, as the Golden Globes are to the Oscars.  You can find the Nebula nominees listed here:\r\nhttps://www.sfwa.org/2016/02/2015-nebula-awards-nominees-announced/\r\n\r\nThe Sad Puppies do appear to be doing a recommended reading list rather than a slate this year.  You can see what stories they most liked here:\r\nhttp://sadpuppies4.org/sp4-recommendations-pages-and-faq/\r\n\r\nThere's also a site called Rocket Stack Rank that has been collecting and collating recommendations from other sources, here:\r\nhttp://www.rocketstackrank.com/p/2016-hugo.html\r\n\r\nAnd those are just a few places that the awards are being discussed on the web.  As far as I am concerned, the more discussion, the better.  So please feel free to talk about your own favorite short stories, novelettes, and novellas in the comments section here... whether those are from OLD VENUS, from other anthologies, from magazines, wherever...\r\n\r\nRead.  Discuss.  And nominate, nominate, nominate.","ditemid":476905,"eventtime":"2016-03-07 15:58:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, jean cocteau cinema, hugo awards, anthologies, science fiction","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Mar  6 22:57:59 2016]R [Sun Mar  6 22:58:00 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/706614837116178432 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1457412404,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/706614837116178432","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.647701659324675]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1457305136}","revtime":1457988576},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-03-06 22:57:58","anum":233,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html","event_timestamp":1457366280,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24087785#t24087785","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24087785#t24087785","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24087785#t24087785","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"fifmut","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://fifmut.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24087785,"talkid":94092,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24087785#t24087785","upictitle":"fifmut: pic#0","article":"Off topic, I know, but... is there any chance for a Dreamsongs Vol. 3?<br /><br />I have read most of your stuff, but looking at your bibliography, there are still some short stories that I have missed.

It’s a chance to listen to someone who has his finger on the pulse of the community and also an eye on the longue durée of sci fi and fantasy fiction. More than that, it’s an opportunity to hear a master craftsman speak of his craft. With that in mind, I was wondering about your thoughts on the nature of genre, particularly the relationship between science fiction and fantasy. We all sort of know what is usually meant when someone says “sci fi” (spaceships and lasers) or “fantasy” (dragons and swords). However, the two often overlap and blur, and this strikes me as something you like to play with and ponder in your own work. I’m thinking, for example, of the blend of Arthurian imagery with space travel in “Bitterblooms”, how you more-or-less folded a sci fi mid-section into a fantasy framing story, and in the end brought them back together again. I was especially struck by how the protagonist is literally stripped of her sword and furs – the archetypal signifiers of the classic Conan-esque fantasy hero(ine)! – when she steps aboard the spaceship and then has them returned to her when she departs back into the fantasy setting of the snowy wastes (after threatening to smash the story’s most overt piece of high technology with the wolf statue). For me, a lot of the poignancy of the story derives from the idea of the grounded spaceship: if it were grounded on our Earth, I’d take it as a commentary on sci fi in relation to reality, but it’s interesting that you have the quintessential sci fi vehicle stuck in a quintessentially fantasy setting. An icon of imaginative escape from one type of escapist literature that can’t escape another escapist genre. Hmmm.<br /><br />All of this got me wondering about the nature of the two genres. How distinct do you see sci fi and fantasy? Is the division still a meaningful one? I’ve heard you quote Faulkner’s assertion that good writing deals with the “human heart in conflict with itself”... Since one can write on that theme in any setting, real or imagined, do you think that there’s sometimes too much focus on genre? (To the point that some people get so hung up on defining the setting that they miss the beating human heart at the core.) Anyway, this post turned out MUCH longer than I intended. Sorry about that. When you said in your recent interview with Ryan Condal that “part of the charm is figuring out the world”, it got me thinking: this usually means figuring out how the world relates to our own (the “Planet of the Apes” ending!), but, more rarely, it’s figuring out that a fantasy setting is really a sci fi setting... In that case, were they one and the same all along? And what do we really mean when we make that distinction in the first place?<br /><br />p.s. I’ll definitely pick up a copy of “Old Venus”.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"March 7 2016, 04:36:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"pondering genre","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://valcarenghi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"valcarenghi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"valcarenghi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://valcarenghi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"March 7 2016, 06:02:37 UTC","dname":"valcarenghi","ctime_ts":1457325377,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/36918195/6781987","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24090345#t24090345","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24090345#t24090345","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24090345#t24090345","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"f4f3","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://f4f3.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24090345,"talkid":94102,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24090345#t24090345","upictitle":"f4f3: Strange","article":"Thanks for the timely reminder that I've cruelly neglected to read Old Venus OR Old Mars.

A strong story about language, communication, and cultural differences, and about questioning one's assumptions. <br /><br />\"The Servant\" by Emily Davenport, from Clarkesworld.<br /><br />\"Irindai\" by Bradley P. Beaulieu, from the anthology \"Blackguards\" <br /><br />Short story<br />\"Pocosin\" by Ursula Vernon, Apex Magazine.<br />It's good for basically the same reasons Jackalope Wives are good. <br /><br />\"Damage\" by David D. Levine, tor.com.<br />This story is thematically related to last year's nominee \"Turncoat\", but totally runs circles around it quality-wise. <br /><br />\"Scream\" by Anton Strout, from the anthology \"Blackguards\".<br />I liked this primarily for one particular scene, a fabulous description of a painting and of the artist who painted it that is made possible by the protagonist's magical abilities. <br /><br />\"The Customer is Always Right\" by Anna Salonen, Mothership Zeta.<br />A short and whimsical story that made me laugh out loud. <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"March 7 2016, 19:18:59 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Some favourites","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lagopus-muta.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lagopus_muta","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lagopus_muta","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lagopus-muta.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lagopus_muta","ctime_ts":1457378339,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/24518683/565862","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24093673#t24093673","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24093673#t24093673","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24093673#t24093673","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"balinares","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://balinares.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24093673,"talkid":94115,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476905.html?thread=24093673#t24093673","upictitle":"Balinares: sundance_by_weasely","article":"I hope that Marietta Ren's Phallaina scores at least a nomination, because someone managing to do something so new around its chosen medium is rare and precious.<br /><br />Also, I'll be chucking a nom' at Hardhome, but great as it was, I don't think Game of Thrones stands too strong a chance this year.

It ran in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in the July/Aug 2015 issue.<br /><br />This is a story that will grab you and charm you and enrich you whenever you get around to reading it, and it will keep, but if you wait you won't get a chance to nominate it in time. Oh hell, I'm gushing.<br /><br />I love the narrator/protagonist (a young woman, coming of age and coming into her family role as a prophet and recorder of events), I love her voice, I love the very prosaic modern setting, I love the way that both she and the townspeople react to some rather alarming events, and I love the eerie build-up and conclusion. This could probably get nominated as fantasy, as horror, and as YA, but I think it deserve a Hugo as well.<br /><br />The writing is at the perfect level of skillful without being distracting with writerly \"look at my prose\" elements. I suppose it couldn't have been written without Lovecraft having paved the way (there seems to be a powerful ancient undersea evil resurfacing), but it isn't pastiche or reboot or tribute or copy.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"March 8 2016, 02:14:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ticktockman.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ticktockman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ticktockman","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ticktockman.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ticktockman","ctime_ts":1457403294,"tracked":0}]}
