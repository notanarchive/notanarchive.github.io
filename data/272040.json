Some of the major events have been nailed down, but any program schedule is likely to change due to factors outside the control of the convention or attendees, so it is wise to have some flexibility in your own schedule, and check the updates of the daily program the convention will announce throughout the weekend.<br /><br />Adam Whitehead, of the most excellent SF/F review blog, the Wert Zone (<a href='http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/</a>),<wbr /> will be interviewing George, right now scheduled for Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Also scheduled are signing sessions, and a few panels with other attendees on various subjects. One highlight should be the WILD CARDS panels. Some of the creators/writers, including George, will celebrate 25 years of WILD CARDS, discuss the experience of working in a shared world, and upcoming WILD CARDS projects.<br /><br />If you haven't already done so, do check out the Brotherhood Without Banners forum at <a href='http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/forum/7-brotherhood-without-banners/' rel='nofollow'>http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/fo<wbr />rum/7-brotherhood-without-banners/</a>. As always, the Bros are planning to host some most excellent events and get-togethers. It's a good way to meet other GRRM readers and make some new friends.<br /><br />We are bringing over some GRRM-related objects of desire to donate to the convention's charity auction which will benefit OXFAM and the fan charity TAFF, as well as a few things for the BwB fundraiser that helps them underwrite the costs of their events and parties. The auction supports the convention's charity, and you can find items that are not available for retail sale, are rare or collectible, often at very good bid prices. I use them to find unique things to give as gifts for friends, since it's hard to find the perfect gift for fellow book lovers and media geeks who already have accounts with Think Geek and the major SF/F book dealers. Usually, the auctioneers and the audience are all in for a good time, so we have a good time while doing good deeds.<br /><br />We hope to have more information we can share about specific events at the convention before we leave for the UK. Just remember, there can always be changes at the last minute.<br /><br />See you there!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"March 4 2012, 18:53:25 UTC","parent":15604392,"massactions":0,"subject":"George will be doing all sorts of events over the weekend","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1330887205,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15651752#t15651752","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15651752#t15651752","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15651752#t15651752","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sevvem","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sevvem.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15651752,"talkid":61139,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15651752#t15651752","above":15609000,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","parent":15609000,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: George will be doing all sorts of events over the weekend","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sevvem.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sevvem","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sevvem","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sevvem.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sevvem","ctime_ts":1331489019,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115943574/46395501","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15604648#t15604648","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15604648#t15604648","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15604648#t15604648","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1044302","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/kewlrats","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15604648,"talkid":60955,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/272040.html?thread=15604648#t15604648","upictitle":"Dalibor Dimovski: pic#115943574","article":"I AM EXCITE!<br />The trailer is truly EPIC.
