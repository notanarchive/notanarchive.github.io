{"itemid":524,"subject":"Last Call for Clarion","event":"Applications for the 2010 Clarion Writer's Workshop in San Diego close on March 1... so if you've been thinking of applying, now's the time to get your act together.\r\n\r\nI will be one of the instructors at this year's Clarion.  \r\n\r\nThe good folks at the workshop sayeth:\r\n\r\n\"Clarion is widely recognized as a premier training ground for aspiring writers of fantasy and science fiction short stories. Many graduates have become well-known writers, and a large number have won major awards. Instructors are among the most respected writers and editors working in the field today. The 2010 writers in residence are Delia Sherman, George R.R. Martin, Dale Bailey, Samuel R. Delany, Jeff VanderMeer and Ann VanderMeer.\r\n\r\n\"The six-week workshop is held on the beautiful beachside campus of the University of California, San Diego.  Since its inception in 1968, Clarion has been known as the “boot camp” for writers of speculative fiction. Each year 18 students, ranging in age from late teens to those in mid-career, are selected from applicants who have the potential for highly successful writing careers. Students are expected to write several new short stories during the six-week workshop, and to give and receive constructive criticism. Instructors and students reside together in campus apartments throughout the intensive six-week program.\r\n \r\nThe application period for the 2010 workshop ends on March 1. Applicants must submit two short stories with their application. Scholarships are available. Additional information can be found at http://clarion.ucsd.edu.\"","ditemid":134244,"eventtime":"2010-02-17 17:15:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":253,"taglist":"writing","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":73,"commentalter":1268149762,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"28:1,18:8,6:1,30:1,57:5,46:1,23:15,3:68,19:3,4:49,20:3,9:21,21:8,nterms:no","verticals_list":"books"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-02-18 00:15:28","anum":100,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html","event_timestamp":1266426900,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/3345887/777502","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?replyto=8805476","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805476#t8805476","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805476#t8805476","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805476#t8805476","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cuddlycthulhu","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cuddlycthulhu.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8805476,"talkid":34396,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805476#t8805476","upictitle":"Renfield: Ren","article":"Already applied.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"February 18 2010, 00:23:24 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cuddlycthulhu.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cuddlycthulhu","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cuddlycthulhu","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cuddlycthulhu.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cuddlycthulhu","ctime_ts":1266452604,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97053862/21312787","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?replyto=8805732","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805732#t8805732","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805732#t8805732","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805732#t8805732","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805732#t8805732","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"brilliantpearl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://brilliantpearl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8805732,"talkid":34397,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/134244.html?thread=8805732#t8805732","upictitle":"Jackie: sun tms","article":"Hey GGRM, I'm a longtime reader and an unpublished writer.

For anyone.<br /><br />For all those of us that can't go, though, there are still some great books about writing out by some great writers, and we can still try to get a few short stories done in the time-frame. Kind of like following along in independent study. Not having the scratch or the time to go to the great confences and classes doesn't have to stop us from writing and studying. All those fantasic writers were once unpublished, unrecognised scribblers, too. They got there from here, at one point in time. Clarion would be excellent, but you can be excellent in your living room, too.
