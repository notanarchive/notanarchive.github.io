{"itemid":316,"subject":"Random Thoughts at Midnight","event":"Just a few days left in March.  When the month ends, so does our foreign edition sale, so if you want $5 off the foreign translations of any of my books, this is the time to act.\r\n\r\nI really don't know where the time goes.  It seems like yesterday I was watching the Superbowl, and a few days before that I was just getting back from Spain and Portugal.  The days and weeks and months seem to go by so quickly now... and the pages come so slowly...\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Spain and Portugal, I meant to post a lot more about my travels there last summer, and to post some pictures too.  Another good intention swallowed by the demands of work and the lateness of the hour.  I may still post a few things, though.  Better late than never, I suppose... and it was a wonderful trip.\r\n\r\nI need to post about WATCHMEN (which I loved) and the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA finale (which I pretty much hated) too.  In my copious spare time.  But I really do have a lot to say about both.  The Watchmen/ Wild Cards compare-and-contrast exercise is an essay in itself...\r\n\r\nSubterreanean Press sent me an Advanced Reading Copy of the Jack Vance tribute anthology, SONGS OF THE DYING EARTH, a few days ago, and I've been dipping into it.  I'd read all the stories before, of course, but it's still fun to revisit them.  I even reread my own story, \"A Night at the Tarn House,\" and thought it held up pretty well.  That's always a relief.  Sometimes I hate my own stuff when I reread (sometimes I love it, too, I'm a moody sonofabitch).  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0003q6se/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0003q6se/s320x240\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nI hope Jack Vance likes the book.  The impact he's had on the field, and especially on the writers in the anthology, has been immense.\r\n\r\nI've also just received a couple of advance copies of the limited edition FEAST FOR CROWS from Subterranean.  Oh my, oh my.  What a beautiful book.  Tom Canty is amazing.  FEAST is shipping now.  Unfortunately, this is a limited edition, and it was long ago sold out.  The lettered and numbered editions of the Vance book are also sold out, but copies of the trade hardcover are still available from the Subterranean website... and the trade will still feature the gorgeous interior artwork by Tom Kidd.\r\n\r\nSome cool new stuff from Green Ronin Games as well.  Their first Wild Cards adventure, ALL IN, has been released, and so has their new Ice & Fire role playing game.  I need to write a story about those for my website news page... so much to do, so little time... but here's some pictures of the cover art, to whet your taste, at least:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0003ksak/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0003ksak/s320x240\" width=\"184\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0003p021/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0003p021/s320x240\" width=\"186\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nVisit the Green Ronin website for more information for the games.\r\n\r\nOh, and my new Library Tower is almost complete.  Another week, and the renovations should all be done.  It's cost a fortune and there's been a lot of noise and dust and disruption, but it will all have been worth it.  The tower is gorgeous.  I'll try to post pictures, if I can ever find my camera.  I took it to the Page One signing for BUSTED FLUSH, snapped lots of pics there, brought it home, and haven't seen it since.\r\n\r\nsigh\r\n\r\nThe Library Tower should help with that too.  Finally, some organization.","ditemid":80955,"eventtime":"2009-03-28 00:07:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":573,"taglist":"wild cards, subterranean, dying earth","current_moodid":73,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1352694207,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-03-28 06:47:09","anum":59,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html","event_timestamp":1238198820,"reply_count":57,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/82700569/28525","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?replyto=5719099","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5719099#t5719099","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5719099#t5719099","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5719099#t5719099","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5719099#t5719099","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"geg","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://geg.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5719099,"talkid":22340,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5719099#t5719099","upictitle":"Grigori Richardovich: hugh laurie black adder","article":"I would love to see a post about both the love of WATCHMEN and the hate for BSG finale","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"March 28 2009, 07:04:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://geg.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"geg","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"geg","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://geg.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"geg","ctime_ts":1238223843,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?replyto=5720891","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5720891#t5720891","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5720891#t5720891","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5720891#t5720891","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5720891#t5720891","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5720891,"talkid":22347,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/80955.html?thread=5720891#t5720891","above":5719099,"upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Me, too.

Period. But the finale, well, the finale felt liked it belonged to a different show, not the gritty, raw, character driven, emotionally and intellectually challenging epic with an intriguing storyline that I loved (particularly during the first three seasons).<br /><br />What bugged me the most?<br /><br />1. Goddidit. Before the finale, particularly during the first two or three seasons, the series maintained a nice balance between the rational and the spiritual/religious, an ambivalence stemming from characters' subjective perspectives that allowed different interpretations. Now: *sigh*.<br /><br />2. Preachy. In a shallow, pseudo-philosophical way. Thank you especially for teaching me that technology is Really Evil.<br /><br />3. Going native. Yes, the Luddite solution really made sense. I'm sure that's exactly what you would do if you were stranded on an unknown planet and you still had access to the advanced technology and knowledge you've relied on your entire life. And if you're Lee Adama, I'm sure you could even convince all 30,000 (plus) of your fellow citizens to do the same. Lazy writing (or just forced into a corner).<br /><br />4. The loose ends were tied up so fast that they either missed most of them or just messed them up. There's something to be said about planning ahead, at least a little, rather than just making stuff up as you go along and then suddenly finding yourself writing the finale and having no clue about how to properly explain all the things you've kinda promised to explain.<br /><br />5. Take your pick.<br /><br />Yeah, I pretty much hated the finale as well.

I have been visiting this site for a long time, but this is my first post.  Love your books and your politics!<br /><br />I couldn't help but giggle a little bit when I read your post about wanting to comment on Watchmen and the BSG finale.  It seems you've created an audience for something else now that people are anxious for you to write.  Just don't even hint about WHEN you might plan on doing it because you know if you don't, there's going to be folks whining about broken promises and missed deadlines.<br /><br />I have to admit I am curious about your opinion too.
