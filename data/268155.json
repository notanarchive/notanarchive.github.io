I really enjoy reading your posts - here - and the info your links. The Valentine's Day cards were a big hit, btw. Gave us all a laugh. I also enjoyed the preview for season 2 of Game of Thrones on HBO, which you posted. Still waiting for the DVDs (season 1), which I ordered, so I appreciate your updates (Iceland!!). Keep it up!<br /><br />Here's what I like most about your writing: you can always return! Even after several years. I have re-read all of your 'Ice and Fire' stories that I own, although I am still missing a few of the other books and stories you published. I have some. I forget. I have too may books and no place to put them. It's annoying.<br /><br />I started a LJ book group in 2005 about \"fantasy\", and everyone agreed that I should read your books. That was the best advise I ever got.   <br /><br />What's surprised me most recently is that you seem to have a lot of fans in Russia - I encountered them via the SimHospital game here on LJ - but they sure knew what \"Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!\" was about.

Both series also managed to break my heart. I recommend it to everyone, and I think you'd like it a lot, especially once you get over a slightly high accessibility curve.
