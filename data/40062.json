I know she closed down her forum because she felt she had to be too involved in discussions. That said, I think the tone of it seems too absolutist. Not every writer gets as stuck on writing on their blog instead of writing on their next story as Hobb suggests.<br /><br />The most obvious example is Neil Gaiman, who blogs just about every day, and often answers two or three e-mails from fans and acquaintances in the course of those blog posts. When it's time for him to get cracking on a new project, though, he'll go into seclusion (quite literally, sometimes, when he hides out in a cabin in the woods without so much as a cell phone signal).<br /><br />John Scalzi obviously posts quite a bit, and I'm not sure how he manages to turn out books while he's doing it, but somehow he manages it. And he has comments on his blogs which he responds to directly, too, unlike Gaiman; I'm guessing he's just really good at switching from blogging-mode to writing-mode, whereas many writers find it easier to  focus on one thing intensely and prefer no distractions. Ultimately, only the writer can judge.<br /><br />A number of blogging writers I know of go the Gaiman route, really. They announce they're taking a break from blogging for x weeks/months, and that often seems to work for people.<br /><br />I suppose there is the angle that even in the case of a Gaiman or a Scalzi, if they didn't blog, they'd be more productive professionally. That's a very dangerous perspective, because if they enjoy it and see it to some degree as a fun hobby, who's to say they can't do it? Writers need their hobbies and their fun, too, or they'll burn out. (Well, most of them do, anyways; I'm suspicious of certain authors.)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"March 13 2008, 08:44:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1205397878,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/64757405/1653286","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40062.html?replyto=3618430","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40062.html?thread=3618430#t3618430","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40062.html?thread=3618430#t3618430","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40062.html?thread=3618430#t3618430","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sunblade","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sunblade.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3618430,"talkid":14134,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/40062.html?thread=3618430#t3618430","upictitle":"Dave Rimmer: XIII Vorenus","article":"While I'm sure everyone who reads your posts appreciates the insight into the life of one of their favourite authors, those are the same people who are champing at the bit when it comes to being able to spend their money on your next book.
