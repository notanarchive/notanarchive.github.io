{"itemid":231,"subject":"New York, New York","event":"New York Giants 37 Arizona Cardinals 29\r\n\r\nNew York Jets 34 Tennessee Titans 13\r\n\r\nWhat can I possibly add?  Life is magical and full of joy.\r\n\r\nThe Jets win a huge one, upsetting the previously unbeaten Tennessee team that stole their original name (guess this was a true 'clash of the titans').  Not only did they win, but they dominated throughout.\r\n\r\nAnd the Giants went down to Arizona and defeated a game and explosive Cardinals team that had not lost a home game all season.  That one had me on the edge of my seat all the way.  With that receiving corps, the Cards are never out of it till the last tick of the clock.\r\n\r\nTwo great wins.\r\n\r\nI know, I know, the odds are against it... but for the first time since 1986, it now appears that there exists a slim chance that we could actually get a Subway Superbowl.  And wouldn't that be something?  Of course, since I love both teams, there is the danger that my head would explode.\r\n\r\nDon't want to get ahead of myself, however.  There's a lot more football to play.","ditemid":59328,"eventtime":"2008-11-23 18:44:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":191,"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1227730564,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","verticals_list":"news_and_politics,culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-11-24 01:54:12","anum":192,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html","event_timestamp":1227465840,"reply_count":58,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110786171/9151612","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?replyto=4705472","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4705472#t4705472","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4705472#t4705472","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4705472#t4705472","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"peculiar_writer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://peculiar-writer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4705472,"talkid":18380,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4705472#t4705472","upictitle":"A Work In Progress: Sherlock reading","article":"Whoa, the Titans lost?

They have a pretty tough schedule from here to the end, but if they survive the remainder of the season, there won't be any team they will have to worry about in the playoffs.  The Jets might have a tougher time of it - they have an easier remaining schedule (much easier in fact), but they could run into some buzz saws in the playoffs.  As the Giants proved last year, and Indy the year before, consistently winning tough games into and through the playoffs gets you into the Super Bowl.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"November 24 2008, 04:51:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"NY, NY","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://senorb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"senorb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"senorb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://senorb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"senorb","ctime_ts":1227502279,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?replyto=4710848","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4710848#t4710848","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4710848#t4710848","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4710848#t4710848","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4710848#t4710848","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rmdansak","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rmdansak.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4710848,"talkid":18401,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/59328.html?thread=4710848#t4710848","upictitle":"rmdansak: pic#82652685","article":"George, you don't want it, trust me.<br /><br />I've been a lifelong Steelers and Seahawks fan since I started watching football in the late 70s. When they faced off in Super Bowl XL, the whole experience was a major letdown.  <br /><br />I was still angry about Neil O'Donnell costing the Steelers the championship against Dallas a few years back with those two awful interceptions, and finally when the Steelers make it back to the SB, it's against Seattle!  On the other side, the Seahawks were one of the worst teams in the league for well over a decade, and the one year they make it to the Super Bowl, it's against the Steelers... ridiculous!<br /><br />THEN the game had some of the worst officiating in the history of football, the officials pretty much handed the Steelers the game.  I had truly nobody to root for until the officials were so blatantly one-sided that I ended up rooting for the Hawks just out of disgust!<br /><br />and living in Pittsburgh made this even worse for me, cause all the locals would just annoy me saying how the Steelers deserved that game, even though pretty much everyone else across the country openly admitted it was a farce.<br /><br />But even with one of my teams winning no matter what, I can't say I enjoyed the experience one bit.

Plus, the Roethlesberger TD that wasn't a TD upheld on review.  Then the non-replay of Darrell Jackson's catch for a TD ruled out of bounds as time expired in the first half.

The Titans have a good football team, but the Giants have been a stronger team than them from day 1 no matter what ESPN's Power Rankings have shown.  You do not go 10-0 without being good, but very few of the Titans' wins have been against quality opponents.  They had a good win, not to mention a tight one, at Baltimore early on and beat the Colts before Indy hit their stride.  With that credit now given through gritted teeth, I'm not at all surprised the Jets, who are on fire right now, put it in on them today.  Favre looks good in green, baby.        <br /><br />senorb: There is \"always\" someone to worry about in the playoffs.  Remember the Giants last year?  Dallas beat them twice in the regular season and came in at 13-3 but those two factoids didn't keep me from worrying about the G-Men or get the Boys past round 2.  If the Cowboys keep winning and make it into the playoffs this year, they might be revisiting the Meadowlands in January and I can assure you that if that happens Brad Johnson won't be their QB.  It'll be some kid from Wisconsin who's got a really good road record (especially against the G-Men).  Even if the Boys don't make it in or win a single game thereafter, there are always surprises in the playoffs...always.  <br /><br />All rants aside, I like the Giants.  :D  I mean, really, they're just likeable.  Awww, shucks, did I just admit that?  Maybe it's just that I hate the Eagles and Skins so much that I gotta go easy on one of the other Beasts.
