{"itemid":1656,"subject":"Gene Wolfe","event":"The NEW YORKER has run a major profile of Gene Wolfe.  Good reading, for the Wolfe fans out there... and an intriguing introduction to one of the field's greatest writers, for those who have yet to sample his work.\r\n\r\nYou can check it out yourself at http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/sci-fis-difficult-genius\r\n\r\nThe article becomes especially apt in light of the ongoing Hugo Wars.\r\n\r\nOne of the claims of the Sad Puppies has been that certain writers in our field have been wrongly overlooked when the rockets were being handed out.  There is a certain amount of truth to that (please note, that unlike many on the other side, I am capable of conceding a point from time to time).  We all know the names of the \"overlooked writers\" that the Puppies chose to champion.\r\n\r\nI have my own list, very different from theirs.  At the top of it is the name GENE WOLFE.\r\n\r\nGene Wolfe has never won a Hugo.\r\n\r\nNebulas, yes.  World Fantasy Awards, yes.  Locus Awards, BSFA Awards, Campbell Memorial Award (not to be confused with the Campbell New Writer award).  Even the Rhysling Award for poetry, and something called the August Derleth Award.  But never a Hugo.  Eight nominations, zero wins.\r\n\r\nI would rank Wolfe as one of the greatest SF and fantasy writers of the past half-century, right up there with Roger Zelazny and Ursula K. Le Guin.  Yet he remains without a rocket.\r\n\r\nThe Hugo Awards are not perfect, no.  No more than any other award.  Alfred Hitchcock never won an Oscar.  That did not mean that the Oscars were in the hands of some secret cabal.  Hitchcock, by all reports, would have liked to have won, but he never let it bother him.  He just kept on making movies, and Gene Wolfe just keeps on writing great books.\r\n\r\nWill he get a Hugo some day?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  It doesn't matter.  His books will still be being read a hundred years from now.  That's the \"award\" that matters most.\r\n\r\nGene Wolfe: one of the great ones.  And a class act.","ditemid":424135,"eventtime":"2015-04-27 16:53:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"worldcon, hugo awards. writing","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1430410644,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Gene Wolfe http://goo.gl/pAgZSK","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.729626791828634]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430177848}","revtime":1430720144},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-27 22:52:19","anum":199,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html","event_timestamp":1430153580,"reply_count":43,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117094227/2289645","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21484231#t21484231","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21484231#t21484231","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21484231#t21484231","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jere7my","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jere7my.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21484231,"talkid":83922,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21484231#t21484231","article":"Aye, sir.

Gene Wolfe is now one of my all-time favourite writers. However,, I couldn't read his stuff until I was in my late twenties. I kept bouncing off \"The Book of the New Sun\" multiple times. I could tell it was an important, great series, but I couldn't get my head around its complexity (in so many diferrent ways). I also meet people now who will akcnoledge that Wolfe is a great writer but that they don't like his books - there's a difference between acknowledging quality and liking something. Historically (ignoring the current issue) people voting on the Hugos (he's been nominated but not won so it's the voting, not the nominating) vote for what they can read and what they like over what they think is good but can't read or don't like.

I devoted my MA thesis to exploring references to Classical and Christian mythology within the novels and ended up with a thesis that didn't feel satisfactory to me at all, because when time was up and I had to hand in my work, there was still enough material left to fill a book. Wolfe's attention to detail is astonishing, from the plot and frame stories right down to the names of his characters. I was overjoyed when last year, a real \"darker than black\" was discovered - this \"vantablack\" exactly matches the fuligin described in The Book of the New Sun. How many people would've believed this was possible in the 80's?<br /><br />The fact that Wolfe won a number of other awards, but never a Hugo, does make me as a European wonder about the importance of these awards and whether there is a hierarchy of sorts. What makes one more prestigious than the other? Why is a group of people hounding one award for supposedly overlooking their favourites when there are so many other awards to be won?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 28 2015, 18:51:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://volucria.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"volucria","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"volucria","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://volucria.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"April 28 2015, 18:53:57 UTC","dname":"volucria","ctime_ts":1430247106,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21519303#t21519303","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21519303#t21519303","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21519303#t21519303","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21519303,"talkid":84059,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html?thread=21519303#t21519303","above":21516231,"upictitle":"George R.R.
