{"itemid":1603,"subject":"For Your Consideration: Stuff Not By Me","event":"Now that I've done the de rigeur listing of all of my own stuff published in 2014, I wanted to say a few words about some other things that I will nominating.  \r\n\r\nDRAMATIC PRESENTATION, LONG FORM.  It was a great year for SF and fantasy movies.  GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a lot of fun and will undoubtedly end up on the final ballot... but I'd go with INTERSTELLAR as the best of the year.  The most ambitious and challenging SF film since Kubrick's 2001.  A feast for the eyes, and a film that demands to be seen more than once.  I will also be nominating a long-shot: PREDESTINATION, the film version of the ultimate time-travel story, Robert A. Heinlein's \"All You Zombies.\"  RAH himself would have liked this, I suspect: very faithful to his story, well directed, superb acting (Sarah Snook especially).  It's a small film compared to blockbusters like GUARDIANS and INTERSTELLAR, but I hope it won't be overlooked.\r\n\r\nDRAMATIC PRESENTATION, SHORT FORM.  Sure, I'd be thrilled if one or more episodes of GAME OF THRONES made the ballot... but I have to admit, there was a LOT of great SF and fantasy on TV last year.  It would great if the voters would start looking beyond our show and DOCTOR WHO.  ORPHAN BLACK got a nomination last year, and probably deserves another one.  The British anthology series BLACK MIRROR had some wonderfully original and mind-bending segments.  Horror fans had a lot to enjoy between THE WALKING DEAD, Z NATION, and PENNY DREADFUL.  And for something truly from left field, the always witty crime romcom CASTLE has been known to wander into SF from time to time.  The time travel episode from 2013 was overlooked, alas... but 2014 included \"The Time of Our Lives,\" a parallel worlds story that I enjoyed almost as much.\r\n\r\nBEST PROFESSIONAL ARTIST.  John Picacio, of course.  Donato, for the calendar, as mentioned in my last post.  But also MICHAEL KOMARCK, and JOHN HOWE, and ALAN LEE, and MAGALI VILLENUEVE.\r\n\r\nBEST NOVEL.  The big one.  I read a lot of good novels in 2014... but, alas, not all of them were published in 2014.  So many books, so little time, it's hard to match the reading to the awards calendar.  One of the 2014 books that I did read stands above all the others, however: STATION ELEVEN, by Emily St. John Mandel.  As best I can recall, I've never met Emily St. John Mandel, and I've never read anything else by her, but I won't soon forget STATION ELEVEN.  One could, I suppose, call it a post-apocolypse novel, and it is that, but all the usual tropes of that subgenre are missing here, and half the book is devoted to flashbacks to <i><b>before</b></i> the coming of the virus that wipes out the world, so it's also a novel of character, and there's this thread about a comic book and Doctor Eleven and a giant space station and... oh, well, this book should NOT have worked, but it does.  It's a deeply melancholy novel, but beautifully written, and wonderfully elegiac... a book that I will long remember, and return to.\r\n\r\nBEST FAN WRITER.  There have been arguments in the past about what, precisely, constitutes fan writing, and who should or should not be eligible for this award.  LAURA J. MIXON is a professional writer, and a very talented one, with half a dozen strong novels under her own name and her pseudonym of M.J. Locke... but this year she published on-line, in a non-professional and unpaid capacity, 'A Report on Damage Done by One Individual Under Several Names,' a detailed, eloquent, and devastating expose of the venomous internet troll best known as 'Requires Hate' and 'Winterfox.'  You can find it here:  http://laurajmixon.com/2014/11/a-report-on-damage-done-by-one-individual-under-several-names/   It's not your usual sort of fan writing, admittedly... but it wasn't done for money, and it wasn't published professionally, and it's a terrific piece of journalism, an important piece that speaks to issues of growing importance to fandom in this internet age.  So I'm nominating Mixon for Best Fan Writer, and I urge you to do the same.","ditemid":410394,"eventtime":"2015-03-08 18:39:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, awards","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1426201486,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" For Your Consideration: Stuff Not By Me http://j.mp/1NyqT72","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.627668874510044]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1425861483}","revtime":1426617680},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-09 00:37:43","anum":26,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html","event_timestamp":1425839940,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20337946#t20337946","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20337946#t20337946","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20337946#t20337946","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20337946#t20337946","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vdevilleneuve","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vdevilleneuve.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20337946,"talkid":79445,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20337946#t20337946","upictitle":"vdevilleneuve: pic#0","article":"But you misspelled Magali Villeneuve 's last name.

A lot of people (critics and fans alike, it would seem) did not like it as much as I would have thought. I thought Interstellar was a remarkable, effective, and moving piece of cinematic achievement that has been grossly overlooked by all major award ceremonies. It is consistently irritating, as I'm sure you would agree, that a big budget science fiction movie is acknowledged only for its technical achievements and not its acting, writing, or directing merits. I have seen the eight movies nominated for best picture, and while I enjoyed some more than others, I don't think any has compared to Interstellar dramatically (though the importance of pieces such as Selma or The Imitation Game I won't deny).<br /><br />I also strongly respect your continued appreciation of others' arts in general. It is truly telling of your passionate inner-fanboy, not to mention your humility, that you take the time to promote not only your own work for Hugo consideration, but also write an entire (long and detailed) post on other writers' and creators' works, year after year. While I will unfortunately never get a chance to devote as much time to pursuing new work as I would like, it is always nice to see you commend others for their work, and perhaps give me a starting point to delve into 2014's offerings.<br /><br />Of course, I continue to look forward to your very own upcoming books...whenever, indeed, they do, come out!<br /><br />Very sincerely yours,<br />David Rosenblatt","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"March 9 2015, 14:28:08 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Interstellar","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/david.rosenblatt","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"David Rosenblatt","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_951586","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=45035353&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"David Rosenblatt","ctime_ts":1425911288,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124690532/67173042","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20343066#t20343066","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20343066#t20343066","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20343066#t20343066","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20343066#t20343066","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2247503","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/james.riley.5648","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20343066,"talkid":79465,"etime_ts":"1425923273","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/410394.html?thread=20343066#t20343066","above":20342042,"upictitle":"James Riley: pic#124690532","article":"You don't think the other Best Picture-nominated films stand up to Interstellar dramatically??

While I liked the film for its sheer audacity, I felt that Nolan (once again) overreached in the story department. The entire final act, without spoilers for those who have yet to see it, made little to no sense and hinged on an improbable plot point. I understand it's a movie, and delving into fantastic territory and unknown science, but the plot-hole the final leg of the narrative hinged upon felt so gaping, I couldn't overlook it and it ended up souring the film's payoff for me. <br /><br />Guardians was fantastic but I would probably give Predestination the nod for best SF film this year. It really blew me away, and perhaps even more so because I hadn't actually read the original story by Heinlein. Sarah Snook was incredible in it, and Ethan Hawke didn't do too bad either. Definitely an overlooked gem, and one I can't wait to show to as many of my friends as possible.
