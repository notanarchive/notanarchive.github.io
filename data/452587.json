{"itemid":1767,"subject":"Hugo Thoughts","event":"Talking about sports this morning is immeasurably depressing... so I am going to talk about science fiction and the Hugo awards instead.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of relative quiet, the Puppygate mess seems to be stirring again.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope -- maybe a naive hope -- that this time around, we can actually talk about the WORK instead of engaging in endless recrimination and name-calling.  I am, I confess, not optimistic on that front, but I am going to try to do my bit, by... well, by talking about the work.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I have usually made my own Hugo recommendations only after nominations have opened.  But in light of what happened last year, it seems useful to begin much sooner.  To get talking about the things we like, the things we don't like.  This is especially useful in the case of the lesser known and obscure work.  Drawing attention to such earlier in the process is the best way to get more fans looking at them... and unless you are aware of a work, you're not likely to nominate it, are you?  (Well, unless you're voting a slate, and just ticking off boxes).\r\n\r\nLet me start with the Dramatic Presentation category.  Long form.\r\n\r\nBig Hollywood movies traditionally dominate this category.  I suspect it will be the same this year.  The new STAR WARS comes out at year's end, and has to be the favorite here.  I have not seen it, you have not seen it, no one really knows if it will be another EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or another PHANTOM MENACE... but it's still STAR WARS, and I suspect it will be nominated.\r\n\r\nTHE MARTIAN should also be nominated.  A great adaptation of a terrific book, I actually think it has a fair chance of upsetting STAR WARS.  Fans of hard SF -- and there are a LOT of those -- love this one, and for good reason.  I loved it too.  (And wish we'd been allowed to screen it at my theatre).  There seems to be some confusion about whether Andy Weir is still eligible for the Campbell Award, by the way... but if he is eligible, he should certainly be nominated.  \r\n\r\nAlso, there's MAD MAX: FURY ROAD.  I loved the old Mad Max movies (especially THE ROAD WARRIOR), and this one was a worthy successor.  Deserves a space on the ballot for sure.\r\n\r\nThose are the big obvious choices.  But let me draw your attention to a few more obscure possibilities.\r\n\r\nPREDESTINATION is an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's classic short \"All You Zombies.\"  It actually came out last year (we showed it at the JCC), but had little distribution.  For that reason, the Sasquan business meeting voted to give it a second year of eligibility, so it is eligible again this year.  It is an excellent little film, with a wonderful performance by Sarah Snook.  Very faithful to RAH.  If you liked the story, you should like the movie.  Seek it out and give it a look.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a comedy out of New Zealand, about four vampires living together in Wellington, NZ.  I saw it first in Switzerland at a film festival.  It's hilarious.  Won the festival's audience award, deservedly.  Comedy is often overlooked at awards time, if there are no special categories for it.  This one deserves a better fate.  Not a chance in hell it will ever win a Hugo... but wouldn't it be cool if a small, funny film like this could make the ballot?  \r\n\r\nFinally... the Long Form category is not actually limited to movies, though those do tend to dominate.  So do also consider JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL, the seven=part BBC television miniseries adaptation of the Hugo-winning novel by Susannah Clarke.  A lovely piece of work, I thought, and -- again -- faithful to the source material (a big thing with me).  It should not be forgotten at nominations time.  \r\n\r\nI am not urging anyone to nominate any of these... but I am suggesting that you might want to check them out.  They're all works I enjoyed a lot.  I suspect that THE MARTIAN and FURY ROAD and the yet-unseen STAR WARS are all pretty much locks for Hugo nominations regardless, but the other three, the more obscure three, are worthy efforts that might be missed, unless people seek them out.

They've already been mentioned.<br /><br />Fury Road, was to me one of the best in the Mad Max series.

If SW restarts as well as MM just did, then it could win.<br /><br />Ex Machina, was fantastic.  I had a short story published this year related to AI (particularly capturing consciousness in synthetic form) and kept worrying if it would step all over the points I made.  It didn't and I loved that I could not guess where it was going to come out at the end. And it worked wonders with minimal effects. It was subtle. CHAPPIE, the other major AI movie, while visually well done and fun enough, was basically effects driven and so did not match ExM's solid storytelling.<br /><br />The Martian.  I never read the book, but the movie delivered everything I had hoped Interstellar was going to deliver.  Genuine love of exploration and science, despite the dangers.  Minimal science flaws kept it off my eye-roll radar.  <br /><br />At the moment, Ex Machina and the Martian are tied to me for the top spot.  The Martian might edge out ExM at the last moment, simply because it had realistic science and a positive message. The only way ExM might edge out Martian is because it was not an adaptation, and so a great work originally delivered in that format (is that a valid point?). But they were both excellent pieces of filmmaking, period.

There are simply too few movies to choose from and too many fans with strong opinions.<br /><br />The real challenge is short fiction. You've said in the past that you had tried to get people to read more short fiction, but without a lot of success. On the drive back from Sasquan, my husband and I decided that there were two big obstacles that make it hard for people to find the best short SF, and we decided to put together a free web site to address them. (This is for fun, not money, so it isn't monetized in any way.)<br /><br />http://www.rocketstackrank.com/p/2015-ye<wbr />ar-to-date.html<br /><br />The first big problem is that it's very hard to figure out how to get copies of back issues of the three print magazines. So we hunted down all the possible legal ways to get online copies of back-issues of the three big print magazines. There's nothing worse than recommending a story that no one can figure out how to get hold of.<br /><br />The other big problem is that there are way too many stories for an average person to read through. They need a way to filter out the top 5% or 10%. Many of the people who review short fiction do express recommendations, but you have to read the whole review, and that generally spoils the story. So in addition to doing our own reviews, we also collected links to four different reviewers so people could see what stories are recommended without having to read a spoiler first.<br /><br />To beat the puppies at nomination time, we only need to get an extra 200 or so people to read and nominate short SF. That should at least keep them from sweeping the ballots. If you're up for another swing at the windmill, I think this would be a good time to make another effort to get people to give short fiction a try.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"November 3 2015, 15:54:14 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Short Fiction is the Real Challenge","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/104047528081360678099","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gregory Hullender","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3235758","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76533502&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Gregory Hullender","ctime_ts":1446566054,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22981355#t22981355","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22981355#t22981355","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22981355#t22981355","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22981355#t22981355","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22981355,"talkid":89770,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22981355#t22981355","above":22979819,"upictitle":"George R.R.

For my little bit, I'm trying to encourage people to consider November through February as the \"Hugo Recommendation Season\" where we talk about what we enjoyed this year, and most importantly, why. I even encourage people to focus on a different category every week since there are many that often get far less of the spotlight, but definitely deserve the attention.<br /><br />The schedule I semi-arbitrarily came up with is:<br />Nov 1 – Best Semiprozine<br />Nov 8 – Best Fan Writer<br />Nov 15 – Best Professional Artist<br />Nov 22 – Best Fancast<br />Nov 29 – Best Editor (Short Form)<br />Dec 6 – Best Fanzine<br />Dec 13 – Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)<br />Dec 20 – Break<br />Dec 27 – Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form)<br />Jan 3 – Best Fan Artist<br />Jan 10 – Best Novel<br />Jan 17 – Best Short Story<br />Jan 24 – Best Related Work<br />Jan 31 – Best Editor (Long Form)<br />Feb 7 – Best Novella<br />Feb 14 – Best Graphic Story<br />Feb 21 – Best Novelette<br />Feb 28 – The John W. Campbell Award<br />Mar 6 – Late Arrivals<br /><br />So, this week, I would love to hear people's recommendations on which semiprozines people think are great (and next week Best Fan Writers). You can submit links to your recommendations here: https://hugorecommend.wordpress.com/subm<wbr />it-hugo-recommendation-links/<br /><br />But whether people take part in my suggested recommendation season, or not, I am mainly hoping we can talk about the work.<br /><br />And with that - back to the topic - The Martian is currently my top pick. Loved the book and recommended it to everyone who would listen (one of the only books my wife, our kids, and myself have all read), and the movie captured it perfectly. (I will admit to a swell of pride when my youngest daughter's first impression was how accurate it was \"Except why did they change it to starting on Sol 18 rather than Sol 6 since that shifts how much food he has available, which changes the math of lots of other stuff...\")<br /><br />However, many of the others you mention are high on my \"to-watch\" list. Mad Max is the only other one I have seen, and I enjoyed it and wouldn't be amiss at it being nominated. But I would certainly vote Martian over it if given the chance.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"November 3 2015, 19:58:15 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Talking about the work","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/101675194998753335476","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Ken Marable","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2560247","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70532620&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Ken Marable","ctime_ts":1446580695,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22984427#t22984427","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22984427#t22984427","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22984427#t22984427","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3321524","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/115637284064225152611","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22984427,"talkid":89782,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/452587.html?thread=22984427#t22984427","upictitle":"Albert Petrosyan: pic#0","article":"Have you seen Crimson Peak?
