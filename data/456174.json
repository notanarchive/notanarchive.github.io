{"itemid":1781,"subject":"More Pain ","event":"Another woeful Jets loss this morning, this one to the Texans and their third-string quarterback.\r\n\r\nGang Green's defense hung in there valiantly, but the offense looked awful.  Way too many dropped passes by our wideouts, a couple of them sure touchdowns.  And Revis got hurt... after being beaten a couple of times.\r\n\r\nHouston's offensive coordinator had a lot to do with the win.  Very creative playcalling, mixing in the wildcat, and a couple trick plays that caught the Jets completely flat=footed.\r\n\r\nI had feared that last week's painful (and unnecessary) loss to Buffalo might send the Jets into a tailspin, and so it proved.  But this is a case where I hate to be proved right.\r\n\r\nThe Giants had a bye.
