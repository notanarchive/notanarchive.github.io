But it is also likely that nutrition played a role: the daughters of the upper class had amuch healthier and more varied diet than the daughters of peasants, and were less likely to be forced into backbreaking manual labor at any early age.  One of the factors in what we call \"beauty\" is simply good health.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","below":18650591,"ctime":"January 29 2014, 07:19:24 UTC","parent":18649055,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Random Thought on Girls from Great Houses","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1390979964,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119651013/16493210","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354527.html?thread=18650591#t18650591","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354527.html?thread=18650591#t18650591","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354527.html?thread=18650591#t18650591","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mjol1nir","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mjol1nir.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18650591,"talkid":72853,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/354527.html?thread=18650591#t18650591","above":18650335,"upictitle":"mjol1nir: mjolnir","article":"Maybe this is the author's assumption and real noble people weren't so beautiful in medieval time as depicted, but that's great.
