On Wednesday, it&#39;s ONE-EYED JACKS with Marlon Brando.&nbsp; On Thursday, Abbott &amp; Costello in JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.&nbsp; We&#39;re running late shows all three days as well, starting at 11:00 pm:&nbsp; SPIDER BABY on Tuesday, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE on Wednesday, and THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN&#39;T DIE on Thursday.&nbsp; And in between, all three days, we&#39;ll be screening BACK TO THE FUTURE at 6:10 and 8:30.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/192780/192780_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BAR POSTCARD3\" height=\"600\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/192780/192780_600.jpg\" title=\"BAR POSTCARD3\" width=\"422\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOh, we&#39;ll be showing assorted cartoons and short subjects as well.&nbsp;

The coolest part is that we will have Doc Brown&#39;s TIME MACHINE with us as well!&nbsp; Yes, complete with the real flux capacitor, though as I recall this one doesn&#39;t have a Mr. Fusion yet.&nbsp; It will be tooling around Santa Fe starting on Tuesday morning, and during show times you will find it right in front of the theatre (assuming our parking permit comes through).&nbsp; Oh, and we&#39;ll have our own Doc Brown to explain its workings to you.</p><p>And on Wednesday (ONE DAY ONLY) we will have the DeLorean&#39;s owner, Ernie Cline, on hand as well... showing off the car, and signing copies of his novel READY PLAYER ONE.\r\n\r\nThe DeLorean will be hard to top, admittedly... but we hope our new bar will be a star attraction as well.&nbsp;
