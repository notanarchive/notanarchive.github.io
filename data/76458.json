{"itemid":298,"subject":"Time Is Running Out","event":"Time is running out to nominate for this year's Hugo Awards.  Nominations close on February 28, remember.  Members of Denvention III (last year's worldcon) and/ or Anticipation (this year's Montreal worldcon) can nominate on line at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.anticipationsf.ca/pub/hugos/nominations.php\r\n\r\nIf you're not a member of either worldcon, you can't nominate.  However, it is easy enough to sign up for Anticipation, as either an attending or supporting member.  Just go to:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.anticipationsf.ca/pub/members/membership.php\r\n\r\nNominate now... or you can't complain when the shortlist is announced and your own favorites aren't on it.  \r\n\r\n(For MY favorites and recommendations, see the series of posts I made last week).\r\n\r\nTime is also running out for my sale on signed copies of WINDHAVEN.  If you would like to snag a WINDHAVEN hardcover for $18, book rate shipping included, act now.  On March 1, the price goes up to $26.","ditemid":76458,"eventtime":"2009-02-25 11:29:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":163,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1235620559},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-02-25 18:39:21","anum":170,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html","event_timestamp":1235561340,"reply_count":7,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/34996430/1395886","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?replyto=5540266","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540266#t5540266","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540266#t5540266","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540266#t5540266","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"shsilver","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://shsilver.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5540266,"talkid":21641,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540266#t5540266","article":"<i>Nominate now... or you can't complain when the shortlist is announced and your own favorites aren't on it. </i><br /><br />This is fandom, people will always complain whether they have a basis for it or not.","upictitle":"S-47/19-J: Steven","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"8 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"February 25 2009, 18:48:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://shsilver.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"shsilver","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"shsilver","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://shsilver.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"shsilver","ctime_ts":1235587709,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121645464/16846061","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?replyto=5540522","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540522#t5540522","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540522#t5540522","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540522#t5540522","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kevinsansone","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kevinsansone.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5540522,"talkid":21642,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/76458.html?thread=5540522#t5540522","upictitle":"Kevin: 2013","article":"I would be very interested in obtaining a signed hardcopy of Windhaven.
