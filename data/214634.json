{"itemid":838,"subject":"New Cover for the UK","event":"The good folks at Harper Collins Voyager, my publishers in the United Kingdom and Australia, have informed me that they've changed the cover for the forthcoming DANCE WITH DRAGONS hardcover.\r\n\r\nThey've decided to go with the same cover art as on the American edition, though the design and background colors will vary.\r\n\r\nHere's the old UK cover:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g3cp9/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g3cp9\" width=\"313\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd here's the new one:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g4yxt/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g4yxt/s640x480\" width=\"310\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nI know the long delay with DANCE has frustrated many of you... but hey, it's certainly provided a lot of gainful employment for book designers and cover artists.  I wonder if I deserve a line in the Guinness Book of World Records: the unpublished book with the most covers.\r\n\r\nThis one should stick, though.\r\n\r\nJuly 12.

I am asking this with the greatest respect for my favorite author, who does not like to be rushed. But this has been a very long wait. I am a bit worried that the vastly increased publicity, public appearances etc etc though the HBO series will take away even more writing time. Why not just finish the series, then go on every Convention, tour etc that comes along. I had cancer in 2009 and while I am recovered now (hopefully), one of the things that would have annoyed me most would been to croak before I can read the conclusion of the ASoIaF series.
