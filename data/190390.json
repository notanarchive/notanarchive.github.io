{"itemid":743,"subject":"Maybe I'll Live","event":"Well, at least I have the Jets.  This week.\r\n\r\nGang Green eked one out against Pittsburgh, though they drew it out till the last play, and for a while there it felt as though I was about to have a second dagger thrust through my heart.  A good road win against a tough opponent (though not nearly as tough as when Troy is in).  The offense looked better than it has the last two weeks (hard to look worse), especially Sanchez.  The D did well at times as well... the safety was great... but letting the Steelers drive down the field like that in the final minute left me with my heart in my throat.  No way they should make that 3rd-and-24.\r\n\r\nAs for the Giants game... I am still in shock.  Sickening.\r\n\r\nI have never hated the Eagles the way I hate the Cowboys, despite them beating us so often these past few years.  But I think I'm getting there.  Philadelphia replacing Donovan McNabb, a good guy who took a lot of undeserved abuse, with Michael Vick, a not-so-good guy who has not gotten nearly as much abuse as he deserves, has definitely colored my feelings... which makes today even more difficult to swallow.  A shattering loss, I fear.  I don't know if the Giants will recover.  And Vick... what can you say?  Sometimes the bad guys win.","ditemid":190390,"eventtime":"2010-12-19 18:14:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":8,"commentalter":1319197747,"personifi_word_count":235,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"15:4,28:4,17:9,18:9,6:4,8:4,10:13,11:9,46:4,16:9,3:13,39:18,9:22,21:4,13:18,nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":2,"revtime":1293091586},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-12-20 01:14:25","anum":182,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html","event_timestamp":1292782440,"reply_count":91,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/95999842/24320456","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?replyto=11601846","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11601846#t11601846","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11601846#t11601846","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11601846#t11601846","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11601846#t11601846","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ripper711","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ripper711.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11601846,"talkid":45319,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11601846#t11601846","article":"George <br />It was more the special teams failures that cost the Giants this time . <br />","upictitle":"ripper711: pic#95999842","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"6 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"December 20 2010, 01:21:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Special teams","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ripper711.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ripper711","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ripper711","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ripper711.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ripper711","ctime_ts":1292808065,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?replyto=11602102","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11602102#t11602102","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11602102#t11602102","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11602102#t11602102","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11602102#t11602102","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11602102,"talkid":45320,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11602102#t11602102","above":11601846,"upictitle":"George R.R.

year or two left in him and didn't deserve much of the abuse he got over the past 3 or 4 seasons.  I was even more upset that Reid traded McNabb away for practically nothing when Kolb seemed like a substandard QB at best - I expected the team to end with a losing record and be in for years of \"rebuilding\" until they could get a good QB.<br /><br />But then Kolb got hurt and Vick came in.  And now, while I still think many Philadelphians vastly underrated McNabb, Vick seems a bit better - he doesn't throw interceptions as much, and he's FAST.  We'll have to see if he has the same postseason failures as McNabb did, but my initial instinct is to say that the team has improved this year, much to my surprise.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm with you on hating the Cowboys.  I couldn't help but enjoy watching them lose so many games this year.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"December 20 2010, 01:42:06 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://van8888.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"van8888","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"van8888","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://van8888.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"van8888","ctime_ts":1292809326,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?replyto=11606198","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11606198#t11606198","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11606198#t11606198","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11606198#t11606198","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"reycoasdwon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://reycoasdwon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11606198,"talkid":45336,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/190390.html?thread=11606198#t11606198","above":11603126,"upictitle":"reycoasdwon: pic#0","article":"McNabb definitely would not have been able to orchestrate that final drive like Vick did.

That's good. But once again Rex has overblown the outcome. Without Polamalu it was easier for the offense to perform well. This victory does not show that they are resilient. The defense had a fair performance, but even at the end the Steelers dropped a certain TD. Rex has to stop overstating their successes. Hasn't he learned that overstating Revis last year is the main reason that there was no Revis Island this season?<br /><br />The Giants lost. There was no reason for the offense to bog down other than simply horrible play calling. Just two more first downs in the fourth quarter and they would have won despite the poor defense. Fewell needs to light a fire under the guys who don't maintain scheme discipline. It has become endemic to this defense. Guys suddenly go off the reservation and generally at the worst possible time with horrendous results. His choice of personnel and play calling in the fourth was also suspect. I wonder if some guys were cramping or fatigued or injured. We saw Tuck trying to cover the TE on a seam route and JPP got no pressure.
