Corey, made up in equal parts of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sad to say, she has turned to the Dark Side.&nbsp; But the Dark Side is considerably closer to her house than the Citadel of Wisdom here in Santa Fe; it will save her three hours of commuting every day, so we can&#39;t blame her.\r\n\r\nBut we will miss her.\r\n\r\nLenore Gallegos has taken over most of Pat&#39;s duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Raya remains as well, and from time to time Jo pops in, so I am adequately minioned for the moment.&nbsp; (In other words, DON&#39;T SEND JOB APPLICATIONS, I am not hiring).&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as I keep that skylight closed, they should remain safely stuck to the ceiling, and work will proceed as usual.","ditemid":391177,"eventtime":"2014-11-06 23:18:00","props":{"current_mood":"sad","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"the writing life, everyday life, santa fe","current_moodid":25,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1416715816,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Pat Floats Away http://j.mp/11kTTuJ","picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[{\"eng\":1},{\"rus\":0}],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1416864019}","revtime":1417116316},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-11-21 06:17:58","anum":9,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html","event_timestamp":1415315880,"reply_count":2,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/108512409/3685538","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19760137#t19760137","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19760137#t19760137","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19760137#t19760137","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wumbawoman","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wumbawoman.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19760137,"talkid":77188,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19760137#t19760137","upictitle":"wumbawoman: Listening","article":"Maybe ties strings on them?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"November 22 2014, 01:56:44 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wumbawoman.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wumbawoman","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wumbawoman","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wumbawoman.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wumbawoman","ctime_ts":1416621404,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125762077/68485576","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19761161#t19761161","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19761161#t19761161","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19761161#t19761161","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2380256","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/104593260185853200767","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19761161,"talkid":77192,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391177.html?thread=19761161#t19761161","upictitle":"Joshua del Villar: pic#125762077","article":"It is always hard to see good folks go, even when you know it meets their needs better.  <br /><br />Keep the skylight closed or yes, maybe  some strings around their ankles and you should be well staffed.
