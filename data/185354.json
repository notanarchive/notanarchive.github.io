{"itemid":724,"subject":"Twin City Fun","event":"If you skipped Days of Ice and Fire in the Twin Cities weekend before last -- or if you were one of the folks who tried to get there and got caught up in that horrendous Saturday snowstorm -- the good folks at Fantasy Flight Games have posted a report and some video highlights of the event.  You can find them here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1783\r\n\r\nThe video clip is also available on YouTube and iTunes.\r\n\r\nThe event was a great success, as was my Monday night signing at B&N.  FFG knows how to throw a party, and I think all the attendees had a good time.  I'm told that FFG is going to do it again next year, so mark down November 11-13, 2011 on your calendar for the second annual Days of Ice and Fire. \r\n\r\n(No, I don't know whether I'll be able to return myself, but FFG will have a special guest there, be it me or someone else.  Maybe more than one guest).","ditemid":185354,"eventtime":"2010-11-24 17:31:00","props":{"taglist":"wild cards, convention, gaming, fantasy flight","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1291866900,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":175,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"15:4,28:8,17:8,18:16,8:20,31:16,1:16,3:20,25:4,26:4,20:24,9:12,21:4,22:8,nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1291867403},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-11-25 00:31:51","anum":10,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html","event_timestamp":1290619860,"reply_count":9,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11374858#t11374858","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11374858#t11374858","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11374858#t11374858","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"solanocard","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://solanocard.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11374858,"talkid":44433,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11374858#t11374858","upictitle":"solanocard: pic#0","article":"specific to your books?<br /><br />Well, I guess by next November, there will be a cast of hundreds of TV actors who can represent.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"November 25 2010, 02:21:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Is Days of Ice and Fire...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://solanocard.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"solanocard","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"solanocard","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://solanocard.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"solanocard","ctime_ts":1290651667,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/105750948/31963512","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11375626#t11375626","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11375626#t11375626","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11375626#t11375626","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_316838","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1093545755","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11375626,"talkid":44436,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185354.html?thread=11375626#t11375626","upictitle":"Jim Keller: pic#105750948","article":"Hey George, I'll be having breakfast at Tecolote Dec 23rd around 8:30 am if you would like to join....
