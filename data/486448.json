{"itemid":1900,"subject":"Cool Stuff at the JCC","event":"We had a great author event last night at the Jean Cocteau Cinema, when Stephen Graham Jones dropped by to read to us from his new werewolf novel MONGRELS.  Who knew the danger posed to werewolves by french fries and pantyhose?  I certainly didn't.  We made Stephen sign a large stock of MONGRELS hardcovers before let him leave, so if you'd like to check it out, autographed copies will be available from the Cocteau bookstore.  http://www.jeancocteaubooks.com/  ((Signed copies of Ernie Cline's ARMADA and lots of cool titles from Neil Gaiman, Diana Gabaldon, Joe Lansdale, yours truly, and lots of other great authors are still available as well)).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/357189/357189_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nNext up:  JOE HILL.   You will be here on Monday, May 23, to sign copies of his new novel THE FIREMAN.  And we'll have the usual interview and Q&A as well.  Reserve your seats now from the JCC website; we're expecting a sellout.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we have some terrific movies showing.  On Friday we opened THE MERMAID, a blockbuster out of China; highest-grossing film in the history of Chinese cinema. \r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"731\"/> \r\n\r\nAnd next Friday, we're very excited to be opening HIGH RISE, based on the novel by J.G. Ballard.  Ballard, as every SF fans knows, was one of the giants of the British \"New Wave\" in science fiction, the author of such classics as THE DROWNED WORLD, THE CRYSTAL WORLD, \"Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan,\" CRASH, VERMILLION SANDS, EMPIRE OF THE SUN, and \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered As a Downhill Motor Race.\"   HIGH RISE is one of his major works, an important (and disturbing) novel, and we're all excited to see the film.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"732\"/>\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies!","ditemid":486448,"eventtime":"2016-05-08 15:02:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, jean cocteau cinema, the mermaid, movies, signings, stephen graham jones, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun May  8 21:02:51 2016]R [Sun May  8 21:02:53 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/729416302264090624 ","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1464108857,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/729416302264090624","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.694868754184689]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1462741390}","revtime":1464108886},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-05-08 21:02:50","anum":48,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/486448.html","event_timestamp":1462719720,"reply_count":2,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/486448.html?thread=24562480#t24562480","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/486448.html?thread=24562480#t24562480","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/486448.html?thread=24562480#t24562480","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2524681","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/118250312881037736617","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24562480,"talkid":95947,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/486448.html?thread=24562480#t24562480","upictitle":"MrWalker1000: pic#0","article":"how was the high rise? would you recommend it.
