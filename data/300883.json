{"itemid":1175,"subject":"Time for a New Calendar - Reux","event":"We're well into December now, and time is running out on the year, and your 2012 calendar.  So I thought I'd update my plug about all the nifty 2013 calendars out there.\r\n\r\nFirst off, there's an astonishing SONG OF ICE AND FIRE calendar for 2013, with art by Marc Simonetti.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/460/154542\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/154542/154542_300.jpg\" alt=\"9780345531544\" title=\"9780345531544\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou can get that one via Amazon at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Song-Ice-Fire-2013-Calendar/dp/034553154X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1354065445&sr=1-1\r\n\r\nor from your favorite local or online bookseller (no, alas, it is not likely to show up at one of those calendar kiosks that pop up in malls around Xmas, they prefer to feature only their own calendars).  \r\n\r\nMaybe you loved the 2012 calendar so much that you're slavering for more John Picacio art, however.  That's cool too, and as it happens, John is going into the calendar business on his own through his new company, Lone Boy.  He's doing a \"greatest hits\" compilation of some of his favorite cover paintings, launching it through KickStarter.  \r\n\r\nSee here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1143812835/the-2013-john-picacio-calendar\r\n\r\nNow, for something completely different, there's the Literary Pin-Up Calendar put together by Patrick Rothfuss and friends.\r\n\r\nThe art is by Lee Moyer, and all of the proceeds will go to Worldbuilders on behalf of Heifer International.  The art is by Lee Moyer, featuring sexy (but tasteful!  tasteful!!) pin-ups of characters created by Peter S. Beagle, Ray Bradbury, Patricia Briggs, Jim Butcher, Jacqueline Carey, Neil Gaiman, Charlaine Harris, Robin Hobb, N.K. Jemisin, Terry Pratchett, and Patrick Rothfuss... and me.   All guaranteed saucy.  So if you're a lover of fantasy, of \"good girl\" art, literature, the female form, or feeding the world's poor... actually, helping them feed themselves... or just want to ogle Nekkid Cersei, this is a calendar you need to have.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/460/154749\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/154749/154749_300.jpg\" alt=\"151755_300\" title=\"151755_300\" width=\"226\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBest of all, you can order NOW. Just go to:\r\n\r\nhttp://thetinkerspacks.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-2013-pin-up-calendar\r\n\r\nSo... that gives you three great choices for 2013.  Picacio, Simonetti, or Moyer.  Hey, why not get all three?  Everyone should have a calendar in every room. \r\n\r\nOh, but what about 2014, you ask?  The new year will be done with in no time.  And it always pays to plan ahead.  So right you are.  But as it happens, we have you covered.  I've just gotten a look at the cover for the 2014 SONG OF ICE AND FIRE calendar, with art with the amazing Gary Gianni, and I couldn't wait to share, so:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/460/155000\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/155000/155000_300.jpg\" alt=\"Martin 2014 3\" title=\"Martin 2014 3\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat one you can't buy just yet.  You will need to wait till July, I fear.  But I think the calendar will be worth the wait.  Gary has finished nine of the twelve paintings as I write, and they're all more spectacular than the last.","ditemid":300883,"eventtime":"2012-12-10 18:20:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"calendar","current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1356035838,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":3,"interface":"web","revtime":1356204600},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-11-28 01:20:49","anum":83,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/300883.html","event_timestamp":1355163600,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124483323/36582828","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/300883.html?thread=16894547#t16894547","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/300883.html?thread=16894547#t16894547","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/300883.html?thread=16894547#t16894547","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"insurrbution","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16894547,"talkid":65994,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/300883.html?thread=16894547#t16894547","upictitle":"insurrbution: pic#124483323","article":"Had the SONG OF ICE AND FIRE for 2013 with art by Marc Simonetti since July, and will do likewise for the 2014 one...got my fingers crossed that Stephen Youll may do one the year that A Dream of Spring is released.
