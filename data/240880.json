{"itemid":940,"subject":"Amazon Exclusive","event":"If you're reading this journal, the odds are good that you've already read the first four books of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, and have them sitting on your shelves...\r\n\r\nBut if you're looking for hardcovers to replace your worn paperbacks, or want a nice matching set, or are just one of the completists who wants to own every edition... Amazon has just opened pre-orders for a boxed set of A GAME OF THRONES, A CLASH OF KINGS, A STORM OF SWORDS, and A FEAST FOR CROWS.  You can order them here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/George-Hardcover-featuring-Thrones-Exclusive/dp/0307292134/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1317326305&sr=1-3\r\n\r\nThese editions are an Amazon Exclusive.  Under  the terms of the deal they cut with Bantam, the set will be available only through Amazon, and will not be sold in any bookstore, be in chain or independent.\r\n\r\nI've seen some jpegs of the cover designs, which look pretty cool, but have not actually a set of the books myself yet.  Looking forward to it, though...","ditemid":240880,"eventtime":"2011-10-11 10:34:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"a song of ice and fire, amazon","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1318005757,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":3,"interface":"web","revtime":1319220391},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-09-30 16:34:30","anum":240,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/240880.html","event_timestamp":1318329240,"reply_count":27,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98206424/10443916","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/240880.html?thread=14778096#t14778096","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/240880.html?thread=14778096#t14778096","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/240880.html?thread=14778096#t14778096","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"saetter","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://saetter.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14778096,"talkid":57726,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/240880.html?thread=14778096#t14778096","upictitle":"Stuart: pic#98206424","article":"Matching set?
