You should check out the Cloisters, the museum up in the 90s overlooking the hudson river. The whole place is set up like a medeival monestary/castle, lots of great tapestaries, treasures, and stonework imported over from Europe during the Robber Barron days. It's a great place to visit on a cold winters day, and may very well inspire a few scenes in some of your work, or at least get the juices flowing.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"December 11 2011, 22:28:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"NYC","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cotterpyke.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cotterpyke","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cotterpyke","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cotterpyke.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cotterpyke","ctime_ts":1323642487,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/252991.html?thread=15008319#t15008319","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/252991.html?thread=15008319#t15008319","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/252991.html?thread=15008319#t15008319","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"teamreilly","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://teamreilly.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15008319,"talkid":58626,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/252991.html?thread=15008319#t15008319","upictitle":"teamreilly: pic#0","article":"NYC is magical at Christmas.
