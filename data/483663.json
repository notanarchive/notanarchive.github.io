They seeded their slate with works which are more likely to garner votes because those works are not connected with the rabid puppies.  A good example is the nomination of Neil Gaiman in the Best Graphic Story category. This way they can claim victory even though the nominee might be utterly opposed to their agenda.  The Black Gate fanzine nomination is also a surprise, since John O'Niell repudiated the puppy slate nomination last year.  <br /><br />  The Related Work category is a complete loss.  Granted, the study of Gene Wolfe's works might otherwise be worthy, but it was published by Vox Day's Castalia House.  Jeffro Johnson edits the Castalia House blog.  Possibly the worst of all of the nominations in any category is the blog post by Moira Greyland.  Her devastating story deserves better than to be used to promote the ideological agenda of bigots like the blog owner and Vox Day and it is questionable if it really qualifies as a related work at all.  Who her parents were is the message as Vox Day sees things, rather than the actual content of the story which is all about child sexual abuse and its effects on the victims. <br /><br />  Last year I made an effort to read all of the nominees, even those obviously the result of the slates.  This year, I will not bother.  I haven't looked at the slates, but those with obvious connections to Vox Day and the rabid people are too much of a waste of precious reading time. Even as a fan of Gene Wolfe, I can't force myself to read anything published by or related to Castalia House. I won't knowingly support Vox Day's causes, financially or otherwise.  In cases like that of Neil Gaiman's nomination and some others, I can ignore that the rabid puppies cynically made those nominations and vote for the best candidate. Sadly, in the Related Work category there is no best candidate except No Award.<br /><br />  Plenty of worthy works remain in the various other categories and I hope to read most or all of them before voting closes.<br /><br /> I worry about Worldcon 75 next year in Helsinki, since Castalia House is based in Finland, giving a greater opportunity for neo-fascist mischief promoted by Vox Day and his sycophants.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 27 2016, 05:19:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://langkard.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"langkard","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"langkard","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://langkard.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"langkard","ctime_ts":1461734343,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/26274534/458006","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483663.html?thread=24279375#t24279375","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483663.html?thread=24279375#t24279375","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483663.html?thread=24279375#t24279375","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ravenvoice","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ravenvoice.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24279375,"talkid":94841,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483663.html?thread=24279375#t24279375","upictitle":"Ravenvoice: raven","article":"I was under the impression that RP were hoping for a Bronie stampede if the MLP ep were to ranked under No Award.
