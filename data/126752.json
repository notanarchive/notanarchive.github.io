{"itemid":495,"subject":"Playoffs, Round Two","event":"Four more playoff games this weekend.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Jets game is the one that concerns me most.  Gang Green goes up against the Chargers this week, a very tough assignment.  It should be a classic confrontation of offense against defense.  San Diego will be heavily favored... but hey, the Jets have prevailed as a heavy underdog before... most recently, the last time they went to San Diego for a playoff game.  Here's hoping Rex and boys can do it again, and knock off the mighty Bolts, Philip Rivers, and that running back who stole LT's nickname.\r\n\r\nIn the other AFC game, Colts versus Ravens would normally be a tough call for me.  Once upon a time, I used to love the Baltimore Colts and their great QB, Johnny Unitas, still the best ever to play the game.  Deserting Baltimore for Indy was a crime, however, and killed whatever lingering affection I had for the organization.  Still dislike the Irsays, I must admit, but in recent years I've come round again.  It's hard not to cheer for Eli's Big Brother, and I admired Tony Dungy too; a much classier coach than his archrival, Evil Little Bill.  (Of course, Dungy is gone this year).  Against all that, we have the Ravens.  Great D, and I like great D.  But I don't like Ray Lewis, for reasons I've stated in earlier posts.  I also like ravens (see my books) and Edgar Allen Poe.  All of which would have left me on the fence for this one.  The deciding factor?  The way the Colts laid down those last two games.  Yes, it helped my Jets, but I still think it stinks.  You play to win the game... or should.  So I'm hoping that the football gods will punish the Horseshoe Heads for that, and let the Ravens smack them down.  \r\n\r\nAnd if the Jets and Ravens should both win... hey, the AFC championship would be played in Giants Stadium.  One last hurrah for the old gal.  That would be swell too.\r\n\r\nOver in the NFC, I'm rooting for the Saints over the Cardinals.  I mean, no brainer, how can you root against the Saints?  New Orleans is a great city, and deserves something great after the last few years.  I love New Orleans.  Arizona, not so much.  Besides, the Pottsville Maroons still must be avenged.\r\n\r\nAnd of course I'll be pulling for the Vikings over the Cowboys.  The Vikes have played in four SuperBowls and lost all of them, so they're overdue (though not as due as the Saints or the Jets).  And I like Brett, who was once a Jet, however briefly.  Besides, the other team is the Cowboys.  Jerry Jones, George W. Bush, arrogance and evil.  Down they go!  Die, Cowboys, die!","ditemid":126752,"eventtime":"2010-01-15 12:35:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":472,"taglist":"nfl","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1289718531,"interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"17:13,18:10,35:7,11:4,37:9,38:4,16:9,3:15,25:13,4:4,26:6,39:15,9:4,13:37","verticals_list":"news_and_politics"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-01-15 19:35:47","anum":32,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html","event_timestamp":1263558900,"reply_count":44,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?replyto=8316960","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8316960#t8316960","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8316960#t8316960","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8316960#t8316960","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dizzy34","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dizzy34.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8316960,"talkid":32488,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8316960#t8316960","upictitle":"dizzy34: pic#0","article":"I'm like the exact opposite of George in rooting intrests.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"January 15 2010, 19:46:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"It&#39;s amazing","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dizzy34.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dizzy34","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dizzy34","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dizzy34.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dizzy34","ctime_ts":1263584786,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/2788477/578046","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?replyto=8322592","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8322592#t8322592","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8322592#t8322592","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8322592#t8322592","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"moonchsr","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://moonchsr.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8322592,"talkid":32510,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8322592#t8322592","above":8316960,"upictitle":"Moon: water","article":"Yeah, go Chargers!!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"January 16 2010, 00:29:29 UTC","parent":8316960,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: It&#39;s amazing","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://moonchsr.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"moonchsr","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"moonchsr","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://moonchsr.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"moonchsr","ctime_ts":1263601769,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93830311/82283","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?replyto=8317216","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8317216#t8317216","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8317216#t8317216","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8317216#t8317216","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kishi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kishi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8317216,"talkid":32489,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/126752.html?thread=8317216#t8317216","upictitle":"Brother Flaming Shuriken of Acceptance: Dangerous Thoughts (Iconomicon)","article":"Aw, no love for Arizona.

I think they were still trying to win, just with their second string guys.  If one or more of their all-stars were to be injured in a game that means nothing to them just weeks before games that mean everything, that would just plain suck.  Furthermore, I think it is a great opportunity to start building the on-field chemistry of the 2nd string guys, just in case something were to happen early in a playoff game where one might need to come in.  It gives the whole team a bit more of an edge in my opinion.  That being said, the last few years when the colts laid low before the playoffs, had a week off etc. it hasn't played out well for them as you could argue they are a bit cold.<br /><br />I would love to see the Jets topple the chargers.  Sure it is great that Rivers is passionate, but his war of words with the crowds is enough to think he is a mutton head. <br /><br />Other then that, it is driving me crazy that the Cowboys get what seems like a bit of a walk to the championship.  The vikings have been struggling with who calls the plays, coach or favre and I don't think they have the gremlins out.
