Thursday night, February 18.  We will be screening two new episodes of COLONY, to be followed by a question-and-answer with series creator and executive producer RYAN CONDAL.  Oh, and I'm told a few lucky members of the audience will be inducted into Homeland Protection and go home with red berets from the show.\r\n\r\nAnd of course we'll have our famous popcorn and no doubt a special Colony cocktail as well.","ditemid":472761,"eventtime":"2016-02-12 16:05:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, television, science fiction","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Feb 14 23:04:03 2016]R [Sun Feb 14 23:04:06 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/699006220791730176 ","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1455674406,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/699006220791730176","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.629376734346595]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1455491057}","revtime":1455674430},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-02-14 23:04:00","anum":185,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472761.html","event_timestamp":1455293100,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472761.html?thread=24010425#t24010425","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472761.html?thread=24010425#t24010425","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472761.html?thread=24010425#t24010425","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2502070","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/107533318922709761791","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24010425,"talkid":93790,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472761.html?thread=24010425#t24010425","upictitle":"Mike Rubin: pic#0","article":"...since you're on a similar subject, what were your thoughts about the first season of \"The Expanse\" on SyFy?
