{"itemid":2001,"subject":"Adopt a Wolf for Xmas","event":"Down in Candy Kitchen, New Mexico is the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary, a refuge for wolves and wolf-dogs and other canids (dingos, New Guinea singing dogs, coyotes, even a fox called Romeo) that Parris and I have been helping out for years.\r\n\r\nWe've just helped them put together a new fund-raising film, and I thought that some of you might like a look.  The film is by Elias Gallegos and Andy Atkins.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"863\"/>\r\n\r\nIf you're still looking for the perfect gift for the guy on your list who has everything, why not make a donation to Wild Spirit in his name?  Or better yet, adopt a wolf for him... or her.   Our own association with Wild SPirit began many years ago when our friends in the Brotherhood Without Banners made Parris a wolf mother.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more at their website: https://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/","ditemid":512359,"eventtime":"2016-12-16 15:13:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"charity, wolves, wild spirit wolf sanctuary","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Dec 16 22:12:44 2016]R [Fri Dec 16 22:12:47 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/809883992526684160 ","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1482450691,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/809883992526684160","reading_time":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.636942110792529]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1481926380}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2001?v=1482645769","revtime":1482621009},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-16 22:12:43","anum":103,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html","event_timestamp":1481901180,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126925994/79919867","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25422951#t25422951","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25422951#t25422951","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25422951#t25422951","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"danihinze","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25422951,"talkid":99308,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25422951#t25422951","article":"Rich people in africa, have them as \"Dog's\" seen a lot of wolves when I was small. <br /><br />:) ","upictitle":"Dani Hinze: pic#126925994","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"4 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"December 16 2016, 22:17:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I love wolves ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"danihinze","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"danihinze","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"danihinze","ctime_ts":1481926668,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125878916/77259760","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25428839#t25428839","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25428839#t25428839","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25428839#t25428839","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"writing_mombie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25428839,"talkid":99331,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512359.html?thread=25428839#t25428839","upictitle":"Writing_Mombie: turtle","article":"... simply didn't understand that we are ONE world (and it would be best if we didn't have fronteres - but that just on a side note).
