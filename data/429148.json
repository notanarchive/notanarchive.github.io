{"itemid":1676,"subject":"Reading","event":"I used to have a page called \"What I'm Reading\" on my old website.  It's still there on this new(er) website, actually, but I haven't updated it in years.  Keep meaning to, but there's too much to do, too few hours in the day.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean I am not reading, however.  I read all the time.  Usually a chapter or two right before I go to sleep... but sometimes a novel takes hold of me, and I wind up gulping down the whole thing in a night.  A long, sleepless night.  But I love that when it happens.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just thought I'd mention a few of the books I've read recently.\r\n\r\nI've already commented, at some length, about two of this year's Hugo finalists, THREE-BODY PROBLEM and THE GOBLIN EMPEROR.  You can find my thoughts on those below.\r\n\r\nI also read LINES OF DEPARTURE by Marko Kloos.  This was part of the Hugo ballot as originally announced, one of the books put there by the slates... but Kloos, in an act of singular courage and integrity, withdrew.  It was his withdrawal that moved THREE-BODY PROBLEM onto the ballot.  This is the second book in a series, and I've never read the first.  Truth be told, I'd never read anything by Kloos before, but I'm glad I read this.  It's military SF, solidly in the tradition of STARSHIP TROOPERS and THE FOREVER WAR.  No, it's not nearly as good as either of those, but it still hands head and shoulders above most of what passes for military SF today.  The enigmatic (and gigantic) alien enemies here are intriguing, but aside from them there's not a lot of originality here; the similarity to THE FOREVER WAR and its three act structure is striking, but the battle scenes are vivid, and the center section, where the hero returns to Earth and visits his mother, is moving and effective.  I have other criticisms, but this is not a formal review, and I don't have the time or energy to expand on them at this point.  Bottom line, this is a good book, but not a great one.  It's way better than most of what the Puppies have put on the Hugo ballot in the other categories, but it's not nearly as ambitious or original as THREE-BODY PROBLEM.  Even so, I read this with pleasure, and I will definitely read the next one.  Kloos is talented young writer, and I suspect that his best work is ahead of him.  He is also a man of principle.  I hope he comes to worldcon; I'd like to meet him.\r\n\r\nI also read the new novel by Lauren Beukes, BROKEN MONSTERS, a sort of crime/ serial killer novel with some supernatural Lovecraftian touches.  Set amidst the urban decay of contemporary Detroit, this one has a vivid sense of place and a colorful and interesting cast of characters, but it gets very strange at the end, where the Lovecraftian elements come to the fore.  I don't think it is entirely successful, and it's certainly several notches below the author's last, the brilliant SHINING GIRLS (which would have been my choice for last year's Hugo, but, alas, it missed the ballot by a handful of votes).  I found it an engrossing read all the same, and I will be looking forward to whatever Lauren Beukes does next.  She's a major major talent.\r\n\r\nI also read and enjoyed the new Naomi Novik, UPROOTED.  Novik is best known for her popular series of Napoleonic Era dragon books, so this high fantasy is somewhat a departure for her.  The whole set-up has a 'fairy tale' feel to it, but draws its inspiration from Russian folklore rather than the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen strains more familiar to modern readers.  I thought Novik did a nice job of ringing changes on the old fairy tale tropes, and I liked her characters.  But the story rushed by a bit too fast for my taste; I would have liked a longer book, where the characters might have had a bit more room to breathe.  And I was seriously disappointed by the ending, wherein several important revelations came out of nowhere.  \r\n\r\nNext up?  Not sure.  CITY OF STAIRS and ANCILLARY SWORD and SKIN GAME are all on the stack besides my bed, along with an ARC of the new Ernie Cline novel (yay!).  But the new Stephen King has just turned up as well, so...","ditemid":429148,"eventtime":"2015-06-07 17:58:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"reading, reviews","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1434326036,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Reading http://goo.gl/uJm1tC","picture_keyword":"kid","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.677862203883989]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1433722395}","revtime":1434474583},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-06-07 23:58:16","anum":92,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html","event_timestamp":1433699880,"reply_count":70,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117796605/50627511","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21699420#t21699420","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21699420#t21699420","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21699420#t21699420","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21699420#t21699420","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1271338","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RaUL_AMDERLAINE","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21699420,"talkid":84763,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21699420#t21699420","upictitle":"RaUL AMDERLAINE: pic#117796605","article":"What are you watching on TV, besides Game of Thrones?

(I am still working my way through the nominees).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"June 8 2015, 05:41:56 UTC","parent":21706844,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1433742116,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21719900#t21719900","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21719900#t21719900","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21719900#t21719900","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1407911","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/stevie.gamble.9","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21719900,"talkid":84843,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21719900#t21719900","above":21707612,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","below":21723740,"parent":21707612,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/stevie.gamble.9","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Stevie Gamble","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1407911","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=52559041&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Stevie Gamble","ctime_ts":1433808454,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21723740#t21723740","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21723740#t21723740","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21723740#t21723740","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"marlowe1","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://marlowe1.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21723740,"talkid":84858,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21723740#t21723740","above":21719900,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","parent":21707612,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://marlowe1.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"marlowe1","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"marlowe1","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://marlowe1.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"marlowe1","ctime_ts":1433864205,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21707356#t21707356","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21707356#t21707356","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21707356#t21707356","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"saucyjack87","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://saucyjack87.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21707356,"talkid":84794,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/429148.html?thread=21707356#t21707356","upictitle":"Michael Shonafelt: pic#0","article":"Glad to hear Beukes's newest is good, and I'm looking forward to reading The Three Body Problem. It seems like contemporary sci-fi is in the midst of a golden age, whereas contemporary fantasy is stuck in the throes of a dark age. I know your stance on the meaningless distinctions of genre, but much of what is considered fantasy nowadays is unrelentingly bleak and nihilistic. It seems like many of the authors whom you inspired misunderstand you. They approach characterization by asking, \"How can I make every character essentially amoral, so no one's the good guy?\" whereas you approach it by making even the most initially unsympathetic characters sympathetic, so few are completely villainous. Fantasy's like a temperamental adolescent nowadays, just doing things its father Tolkien would disapprove of. Do you have any recommendations for contemporary fantasy that doesn't simply wallow in human misery, or employs it in an intelligent way in order to make thematic points, as you do?<br /><br />P.S. Still reeling from tonight's GOT episode.
