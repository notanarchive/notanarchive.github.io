it's working to some extent) as well as to see if the game would be worth picking up to start playing a longer campaign.  I've got all these Awesome Dark Sword minis; might as well have a game to go with them, right?<br /><br />Long story short, we had a good time and I wound up running out to the FLGS to pick up the SIFRP rulebook as soon as I got the chance.  We loved the intrigue system in particular, even if the sample intrigues in the quickstart adventure didn't always give all the stats needed to run through the intrigues properly.  Not that the combat system isn't also quite nice...  Got the Peril at King's Landing adventure module too a while later and plan to run my group through it after we reach a logical breakpoint in the D&D campaign and find time to create some characters and perhaps our own house.  It will be fun to try out the rules that were either not included in the QuickStart pdf or just not used by my group when we played it through.  I've been awaiting the Campaign Guide's release for a while now too; good to hear it's on the way!  I'll probably get it significantly cheaper at the FLGS than by ordering it online though (they always have the best prices), so I'll probably skip the free pdf offer and just wait for that.<br /><br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but does the Narrator's Kit not also include a copy of the Wedding Knight in its booklet?  That would be good to know for anyone who might be thinking about ordering both...<br /><br />I haven't played the older I&F RPG before, but I've played a lot of D&D (ie. D20) and this is quite different but seems like a better set of rules for bringing out the gritty feel of Westeros in an RPG.  Combat can be really deadly - you'll probably even run away sometimes! :o) - and the intrigue rules are much better than trying to use D20's clunky Diplomacy skill rules to determine the outcome of all the treachery and manipulation.  But if you really want to try playing D20 in Westeros, Dragon Magazine had a good article about doing just that in issue <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%23307\">#307</a> (May 2003), which IIRC included some stat blocks, prestige classes, suggested campaign arcs, etc.  Not to mention a nice painting of Melisandre for the cover art.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"February 24 2010, 17:14:15 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1267031655,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135846.html?replyto=8886950","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135846.html?thread=8886950#t8886950","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135846.html?thread=8886950#t8886950","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135846.html?thread=8886950#t8886950","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8886950,"talkid":34714,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/135846.html?thread=8886950#t8886950","above":8884902,"upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Yep, the Melisandre was brilliant.
