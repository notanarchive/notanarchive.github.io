{"itemid":1664,"subject":"Reading for Hugos","event":"In my copious spare time (hoo-hah), I am continuing to work my way through the ballot for this years's Hugo Awards.\r\n\r\nJust finished THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM, by Cixin Liu, originally written in Chinese and translated by Ken Liu.  This was the novel that just missed in the original round of nominations, only to secure a place on the ballot when Marko Kloos withdrew.  In a half-century of Hugo Awards, there have been very few non-English originals ever nominated, and certainly never one from China, so THREE-BODY is a breakthrough book in that respect, and a sign that \"worldcon\" is (very slowly) becoming more global.  \r\n\r\nThis is a very unusual book, a unique blend of scientific and philosophical speculation, politics and history, conspiracy theory and cosmology, where kings and emperors from both western and Chinese history mingle in a dreamlike game world, while cops and physicists deal with global conspiracies, murders, and alien invasions in the real world. \r\n\r\nIt's a worthy nominee.   \r\n\r\nIf you like lots of science in your SF, this is a book for you, especially if you love theoretical physics, astrophysics, and mathemathics.  The Chinese background is fascinating, especially the look at the Cultural Revolution and its aftereffects.  And the prose is very clean and tight, which is not always the case with translations, which sometimes come across as a bit clunky.  Ken Liu did a fine job, in that respect; the writing flows. \r\n\r\nThe central character at the heart of the novel is a fascinating and complex creation, but she is not the protagonist for most of the book, and the character who does fill that role comes across as very flat, more a viewpoint than a person.  One of the secondary players, an abrasive cop, is much more successful; he's a bit of an asshole, but the story really comes to life whenever he's on stage.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, I liked THREE-BODY PROBLEM, but I can't say I loved it.  I thought the book started off very strong, but sagged in the middle before picking up speed again toward the end.  And the ultimate ending was unsatisfying... mainly because, as I now see, this is just the first of three.  I DO want to know what happens next, though.  So I will be reading the next.\r\n\r\nNow that THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM is on the ballot, I'd say that it is the likely favorite to win (and I am pretty sure it is about to pick up the Nebula as well).  It seems to have admirers on both sides of Puppygate, which will stand it in good stead, and it should do very well with hard science fans and the ANALOG readers.  \r\n\r\nI am not going to reveal which book is going to get my own Hugo vote... only which ones I think are Hugo-worthy, and deserving of a spot above NO AWARD.  So far, both THE THREE-BODY PROBLEM and THE GOBLIN EMPEROR rank above the line for me.  \r\n\r\nThe other nominees still await my attention.\r\n\r\nAnyone else read the Cixin Liu yet?  What did you think of it?\r\n\r\nTalking about books, after all, is what these awards are supposed to be about.","ditemid":426205,"eventtime":"2015-05-03 17:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1431962961,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Reading for Hugos http://goo.gl/YsI1h7","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.674998652256516]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430694718}","revtime":1433455168},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-05-03 23:11:31","anum":221,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html","event_timestamp":1430673060,"reply_count":107,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121665260/65925132","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21583069#t21583069","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21583069#t21583069","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21583069#t21583069","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2119687","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/bob.jenson","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21583069,"talkid":84308,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21583069#t21583069","upictitle":"Bob Jenson: pic#121665260","article":"I'm about halfway through it, and it's a mix right now for me.

You can always guarantee some quality in that category, since there are so few slots for so many possibilities.  If the Hugo's expanded to include literature from different countries and languages, that would be really interesting.  In fantasy and SF more than any other genre, the different cultures can lead to really amazing innovative stuff.  <br /><br />Glad to see you still read a lot despite working on writing so much.

I get what you mean by one of the characters coming off as flat, he seems more of a person that the story revolves around instead of a unique identity in his own right.  Like his wife and kid show up just in the scene where they're important than just sort of disappear for the rest of the book.  But I was more drawn in by the game, the clever references and history, and the ideas he was shooting out from moment to moment.<br /><br />Like the idea that even just the mere contact with another civilization could completely derail society in general.  He was coming at the concepts he brought up from so many angles that I was fascinated the whole way through, even when the story sagged a bit I was still hooked on the ideas being tossed around.  Even when I was done my mind kept coming back to it, I don't want to spoil stuff in the comments but I'm eagerly looking forward to the next books.  I'd like to see the 450 year payoff at the end of it.<br /><br />A fascinating book all around and I'm glad it will get the chance to be voted on.  It's weird because the mathematics, philosophy, etc, all seem to fall into that Sci Fi literature category Puppies rail against, but I'm glad so many others are enjoying the book as well no matter what they're views are.  I can see why Mr. Liu is such a respected author in his home country.  Ken Liu as well deserves a lot of credit too as you mentioned, I have to imagine it's a daunting task to undertake.<br /><br />Reading the Goblin Emperor right now and still early in it and I'm really enjoying it so far.

And I am very excited about this book. A lot of it reminded me of older sf classics that create lasting pictures in your mind but don't follow the rules of modern storytelling conventions so much. I am thinking about Vance, Bester or Cordwainer Smith. Lius style of writing changes from scene to scene. One moment it is character focused, then it's not. One moment it is \"showing\", then it's just good old \"telling\" (I appreciate \"show don't tell\" in television very much, but I think literature lost a lot since \"show don't tell\" came around as a rule). One instant the prose is matter of fact, the next it is truly poetic. I really loved it, because a lot of what the story is about is also reflected in the structure of the storytelling and the prose. And all together it creates a mighty sense of wonder. <br /><br />I am now reading The Goblin Emperor. And so far I like it. But in comparison to Three Body Problem the style is not very surprising (albeit beautiful). For example when the main character in Goblin Emperor attends a funeral the story spends three pages on how that funeral reminds the character of his late mother. There is rarely a thing happening without some information about how the character relates to it. I get that after ten pages, and I know that this won't change through the whole novel. And that's how most of the fantasy and SF authors work these days (it was different when Vance wrote his novels). I really, really find it refreshing to read something in between that's done differently. That's (one of the reasons) why I am so enthusiastic about Three Body Problem. <br /><br />So far Three Body Problem is my number one Hugo vote.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 4 2015, 05:47:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Three Body Problem","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://simonweinert.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"simonweinert","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"simonweinert","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://simonweinert.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"simonweinert","ctime_ts":1430718463,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124813563/75138548","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21592797#t21592797","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21592797#t21592797","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21592797#t21592797","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"whipt1","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://whipt1.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21592797,"talkid":84346,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21592797#t21592797","above":21589981,"upictitle":"Matt Yaeger: pic#124813563","article":"I got the same sense of wonder from reading it as well.

I have to say that I cannot for the love of anything see the writing flow anywhere in that book; it reads like some of the more awkward fanfics, clumsy and hard to wade through. The only character that felt non-flat initially was the female scientist, and even that only for the first half of the book. So I keep reading those glowing reviews, many from the people whose opinion I respect, and who should if anything be adept at spotting bad writing, and I just don't understand ... it's like most everyone is reading a different book altogether.<br /><br />And I know it's not just me being confused because I've seen a few other reviews that were very negative, along the same lines as mine - and those people are similarly wondering about why everyone is so excited over it. Something weird is going on. It kinda feels like being invited to an art gallery and discovering that you're blind (and that everything smells awful).<br /><br />Writing aside, I've also found the science extremely unconvincing once it gets beyond the boundaries of realism, and I'm not sure why some people call it hard sci-fi. <br /><br />All in all, for me, the only part of the book that was somewhat enjoyable was the one set during the Cultural Revolution period and the aftermath, and that mostly for the exposition of these events from a Chinese author.

As a matter of fact,though the book enjoys great popularity in China, there also lies a phenomenon that some people just can not read into the story,and they feel confused like you in China. That is a common phenomenon. <br /><br />This can mainly be ascribed to the lack of realism you get when you read the novel. The realism decreases when you feel that the character is flat(indeed flat) and when some science and technology described in the novel seems so magical and is hard to believe if it has any possibility to achieve in real life(but it is not that impossible).<br /><br />From my observation, the science and technology part of the novel is a key element that divide its readers into different groups.To tell the truth,this novel IS a heavy HARD-SCIENCE fiction novel. Though it misused the concept of quantum entanglement which really exists in quantum physics, much of the author's ideas is directly deprived from real world science conclusion. <br /><br />That is why people usually geeks who have studied deep into physics or those who are interested in cutting-edge science or those who have read Hawking's book will feel some kind of emotion of shock and mind-blows and even fear. Because what are depicted in the book have the possibility to be real. It is the real science itself seems to be crazy and magical in our modern days to common readers who lack the background, not the idea which derives from it.<br /><br />For instance,in the novel the alien use the proton entanglement to make remote communication,this is a classical problem which has been discussed by Einstein and Bohr in 1951 called EPR paradox.<br /><br />This novel's character is really flat indeed. But most of the science and technology part are plausible,it is the real science that behind these ideas seems unconvincing and magical but they are true.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 8 2015, 12:17:23 UTC","parent":21590749,"massactions":0,"subject":"Reply","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100760980259499/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"吴慧珺","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3141513","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=75645010&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"吴慧珺","ctime_ts":1431087443,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124950809/75555480","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21591005#t21591005","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21591005#t21591005","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21591005#t21591005","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3135572","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/lestatedogawa","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21591005,"talkid":84339,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/426205.html?thread=21591005#t21591005","upictitle":"noir: pic#124950809","article":"Cixin has got some of the wildest and most brilliant ideas in his short stories.

But the plot picked up very fast and I was carried along. I couldn't listen to it fast enough. TBP is the perfect mix of the personal - the cultural revolution background and Ye Wenjie's story - and the cosmic - with a dash of cyberpunkish virtual reality. Is it a literary masterpiece? not by any means. But it's great science fiction, brimfull of crazy ideas.<br />If I had to choose between this and The Goblin Emperor (which I also liked) based only on merit I'd simply decline. They're just too dissimilar to compare. But I do hope TBP wins if only for the fact it's a translated work and recognition might open the door to more voices from non-anglophone countries.
