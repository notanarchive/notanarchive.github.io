This new artwork will appear on the paperbacks, both mass market and trade.  The hardcover will retain its present cover.  Also, a repackage of A STORM OF SWORDS is also in the works, and will feature key art from the HBO series.  I will post that here when it's ready.","ditemid":312483,"eventtime":"2013-02-13 14:05:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"a song of ice and fire, game of thrones","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1361213790,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1361727243},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-02-13 21:05:18","anum":163,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html","event_timestamp":1360764300,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120124537/60379360","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17262499#t17262499","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17262499#t17262499","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17262499#t17262499","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1649870","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/noracbyrd","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17262499,"talkid":67431,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17262499#t17262499","upictitle":"Nora Byrd: pic#120124537","article":"They dropped the 'A'?<br />Either way, thanks for the amazing stories:)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"February 13 2013, 21:27:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"A","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/noracbyrd","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"noracbyrd","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1649870","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=60379360&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"noracbyrd","ctime_ts":1360790861,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120142958/51623257","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17263011#t17263011","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17263011#t17263011","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17263011#t17263011","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sourbillytipton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sourbillytipton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17263011,"talkid":67433,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17263011#t17263011","upictitle":"sourbillytipton: pic#120142958","article":"You've previously mentioned the postponements of the Bantam paperback is at the request of the booksellers.<br /><br />It was postponed a fourth time and now the current release date is 10/29/13.  <br /><br />Is there anyway they could stop putting out these false release dates and wait until they have come to a decision to actually release it?<br /><br />Many fans are clamoring for TWOW preview chapter ever since you confirmed it is not the Arianne or Theon chaper we have all read.

I started reading books and books, more books than my educational teacher has even desired. My teacher had been surprised that i've been reading it at this age, since it had mature content.<br /><br />It boosted my writing and reading skills quite a bit. It was amazing, how much Game Of Thrones teached me in literacy and similar aspects.<br /><br />i just wanted to give you a thanks, for all the help you've given me for the past few years.<br /><br />Looking forward to The Winds Of Winter!<br /><br />Thanks.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"February 14 2013, 01:24:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I&#39;m loving it.","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://profiles.google.com/103869058528529182598","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ext_1650030","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1650030","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=60381668&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ext_1650030","ctime_ts":1360805098,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120142958/51623257","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17266851#t17266851","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17266851#t17266851","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17266851#t17266851","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sourbillytipton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sourbillytipton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17266851,"talkid":67448,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/312483.html?thread=17266851#t17266851","above":17265827,"upictitle":"sourbillytipton: pic#120142958","article":"You hear that George you're the new Dr. Seuss!<br /><br />Dr. R.R.
