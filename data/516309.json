{"itemid":2016,"subject":"Playoffs, Round Two","event":"So this past weekend was the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, being a football fan I watched them all, even though my Giants were eliminated last week (and the Jets never got within shouting distance).\r\n\r\nThere was good news and bad news for the people of Houston.  The bad news was, Evil Little Bill and his Patriots dismissed the Texans rather soundly.  (Not unexpected, sad to say.  Not when you have Osweiler going up against Brady).  The good news was, the Cowboys lost, thereby eliminating any chance of a Cowboys/ Patriots Superbowl, so right-minded fans no longer need to root for a giant asteroid to strike Houston.  Now we can simply root for whoever is playing New England.\r\n\r\nWith neither of my teams involved, I had a lot less invested in this weekend's contests.  The Saturday games were both pretty one-sided, so much so that I found myself multi-tasking and doing other stuff while watching.  The Sunday games were better... especially the epic struggle between the Packers and the Cowboys.  That one looked like a blowout too when the Pack went up 21-3, but somehow Dallas fought back, and tied the game at 28 and then again at 31.  Looked like overtime, but they made the mistake of leaving thirty seconds for Aaron Rodgers.   His sideline pass to set up the winning field goal was the thing of beauty, a throw and catch to rival Eli's superbowl tosses to Tyree and Manningham.  And afterwards, in the wake of the Cowboy defeat, America got to see Jerry Jones making his I-am-sucking-on-sour-lemons face, last seen in 2007 when it was the Giants who sent the Boys home.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas City/ Pittsburgh game also came down to the last second, yet somehow was not nearly as exciting.  The Steelers won without scoring a touchdown.  That's not going to cut it next week against the Patriots and Evil Little Bill. \r\n\r\nSo... Pittsburgh at New England, Green Bay at Atlanta.   \r\n\r\nShould be fun.","ditemid":516309,"eventtime":"2017-01-17 15:34:00","props":{"current_mood":"good","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Jan 17 22:34:24 2017]R [Tue Jan 17 22:34:25 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/821485857408421889 ","current_moodid":126,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1484951815,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/821485857408421889","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.715256370624301]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1484692514}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2016?v=1484951854","revtime":1484951852},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-17 22:34:22","anum":213,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html","event_timestamp":1484667240,"reply_count":40,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25609173#t25609173","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25609173#t25609173","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25609173#t25609173","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3977978","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/115772842449516725788","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25609173,"talkid":100035,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25609173#t25609173","upictitle":"Zachary John: pic#0","article":"You should create a character from Evil Little Bill in one of your stories.

I started reading over the past few years in hope of news on Winds. But the way you describe your reactions to football games is what draws me back every week. <br />  Reading an eloquent adverse opinion on sports is fantastic. Being in Rhode Island, we are roughly 60-40 Patriots fans and New York (Jets or Giants) fans. Having someone put their perspective into a form that I can actually read is immensely entertaining. If only I could find a similar alternate perspective of someone supporting the new pussy-grabber-in-chief.<br />  I do have to admit, however, that I don't really understand that you have two teams you support. I understand that they're in different conferences, but it still doesn't make sense to me. If there was ever a Giants-Jets Superbowl (as a NE fan, I hope there never is), who would you support?<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"January 20 2017, 03:30:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Patriots","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://riut20.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"riut20","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"riut20","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://riut20.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"riut20","ctime_ts":1484883045,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25640917#t25640917","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25640917#t25640917","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25640917#t25640917","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25640917,"talkid":100159,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516309.html?thread=25640917#t25640917","above":25632469,"upictitle":"George R.R.
