A lot of fantasy writers find this mold too hard to resist:<br />-Young man is somewhat of a loner/outcast, has yet to come of age.<br />-The young man discovers powers which he doesn't have much of a grasp on.<br />-Young man finds a mentor, who helps him to learn about his powers.<br />-Before he gains mastery, the teachings are cut off short by the appearance of EVIL in some form.<br />-Young man goes on a quest, passing into manhood and gaining true mastery of his powers before defeating the evil overlord and bringing peace to the land.<br /><br />Yes there are exceptions.

You need it in moderation, and I very much respect GRRM's minimalist approach because he leaves so much room for the characters to do the acting and move the plot. There was not a terrible spell that brought famine and disease to the land-- there was a war fought out by rival houses, and this war burned the countryside and made the people suffer.
