I promise never to discuss politics unless its related to the NFL (what about that overtime rule) and I won't bug you about Dances.  I recently read Game Of Thrones for the first time, and I was blown away by it.  In fact this was the first novel of yours that I have read and I'm an instant fan.  So much so that I ran out and picked up the others in the series.  I have some catching up to do before you release the latest installment. <br /><br />My two cents about the book, if you will permit me, I would wait until all the hype on Thrones HBO series next year before you release Dances.  It would probably mass book sales.  I'm sure your fellowship probably wants to shoot me for making the suggestion that you wait until next year but I think that's a good business move.<br /><br />Wild Cards looks fantastic and I will be checking that out as well.  <br /><br />It's been my pleasure to read your work for the first time and I'm looking forward to reading more, including your \"not a blog\" page when I can.  <br /><br />Connor Hobbs<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 25 2010, 18:01:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"First time poster","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hobbsthegreat.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hobbsthegreat","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hobbsthegreat","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hobbsthegreat.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hobbsthegreat","ctime_ts":1269540109,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?replyto=9415648","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9415648#t9415648","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9415648#t9415648","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9415648#t9415648","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sam_crecelius","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sam-crecelius.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9415648,"talkid":36779,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9415648#t9415648","upictitle":"sam_crecelius: pic#0","article":"This book takes us one step closer to Marxist socialism! :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 25 2010, 18:56:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hard Call","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sam-crecelius.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sam_crecelius","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sam_crecelius","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sam-crecelius.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sam_crecelius","ctime_ts":1269543360,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?replyto=9491936","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9491936#t9491936","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9491936#t9491936","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9491936#t9491936","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vikjha","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vikjha.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9491936,"talkid":37077,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/142560.html?thread=9491936#t9491936","upictitle":"vikjha: pic#0","article":"Hi, i just read this interview thing about wild cards... and the lady (sorry short term memory problems cant remember her name!!) who made the idea... was she sorta influenced by Erich Von Daniken (Chariot of the Gods) ? or was this just an independent stroke of genius? i really like the idea... i feel like it would translate really well into film and be able to have a larger mass market appeal than song of Ice and fire even (tho no matter how good it is, it could never be better than SoIaF for me!) ...

(i feel like this is almost a rhetorical question, very unlikely that u havent).<br /><br />Fans of Wild Cards, i just wanted to put out there, that Francis Crick ( Nobel Peace prize winner) the guy who discovered the double-helixd DNA (on an LSD trip, lol) said about DNA, that it was about as likely that something as sophisticated as Life/DNA came about from a primordial melting pot of organic molecules as a Jumbo Jet being created out of a junkyard...His personal opinion was that somewhere out in the universe some alien race put DNA on a spaceship, sent it out to the universe and it crashed on earth creating our Life on this planet and eventually evolving into us. ALSO!!!! (my favorite part of it) he said the amount of information DNA could store was just about LIMITless (something like 5 percent of our DNA is exons, the rest is introns not expressed, like spacers) and theorized that introns held the History and stored Knowledge of the Alien planet that created life on Ours. Now, i dont know if i believe this, cuz any time someone says \"about as likely as\" i'm quick to remind them that life is much stranger than fiction, but it would be really cool to integrate this into the comics (hopefully movies? lol)... <br /><br />i mean i read the thing about 1948 the alien virus comes... but it could be like, that was the second coming, and the first alien virus was life itself, and u find that out in the comics!... i mean i know the virus was used just as an explanation for powers but it would be cool...<br /><br />Have you read (mr. martin and fans!) jared diamond (the 3rd Chimpanzee & Guns, Germs, and Steel) or Graham Hancock (no, not his fiction for god's sake, his work on the pre-history history), one of you bright minds should write some cool fiction about ancient civilization, 10000 BC was SUCH A DISGRACE!<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 26 2010, 13:16:30 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Alien Virus, Chariot of the Gods, Francis Crick (Hippie! lol)","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://vikjha.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"vikjha","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"vikjha","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://vikjha.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"vikjha","ctime_ts":1269609390,"tracked":0}]}
