Over at the wiki we're unsure of how to include it, no one tells us anything.  So far we've been tentatively treating it as \"near-canon\" for the TV continuity.  But some debate whether we should include info about \"Ramsay Snow\" from the video game on the \"Ramsay Snow, TV series\" article, or just make a separate one.  <br /><br />My hope is that the game is....the analogy I'd use is that old Cadfael mystery series, about a monk whose abbey is in a town on the Welsh border during the Anarchy between Stephen and Matilda.  The main course of the civil war is going on, but the TV series zoomed in to show how it is affecting one tiny corner of England.  <br /><br />The more I heard about it the more I was impressed that they were actually respecting the source material - doing pretty much what I'd do for a spinoff game:  not invent entirely new major Houses from scratch, but focus on the second-tier minor Houses that we rarely hear about, bannermen to Houses like the Glovers.  And I was excited that they actually picked a House name that actually exists in the books (a \"House Forrester\" was mentioned as bannermen of the Glovers in ADWD).  <br /><br />Also sometimes it gets confusing to distinguish \"major House\" (Umber, Karstark, Glover) from \"minor House\" (Cassel, Poole, etc.) -- maybe it would have been better to call them \"Barons\" or something, and the major Houses \"Lords\"...but that's near 20 years water under the bridge at this point.  <br /><br />I know you don't write for the game but I didn't know if the other writers had at least mentioned, \"yeah we're going to work in mentions about the Forresters in Season 5\".  They do something similar with the tie-in game for the SyFy series \"Defiance\" - David J. Peterson also created the alien languages for that show.  The main live-action show will make stray references to characters from the game now and again.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />We've learned in the World book that Meraxes had \"silver scales with golden eyes\" - was Meraxes solid silver, or did it have gold as a secondary color along its horns and spine?  Balerion was black with red highlights.  What color was Vhagar?<br /><br />Also from Yi Ti section of the World book, I can't wait to see the historical drama about Lo Doq, of the Scarlet Emperors.  \"Is there anyone in Si Qo who has not slept with my daughter?!?!\" -- outstanding.

I played on ps4 and felt the game was in line with the atmosphere and feel of your world; i was blown away with the attention to detail in both the characters and the locations. On another note, how did you like the new star wars trailer? I cant wait for the movie, but am far more excited for your next book!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 4 2014, 18:11:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"First of all...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://snowmen4tehwin.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"snowmen4tehwin","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"snowmen4tehwin","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://snowmen4tehwin.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"snowmen4tehwin","ctime_ts":1417716714,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/101252367/578090","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797596#t19797596","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797596#t19797596","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797596#t19797596","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bungeebot","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19797596,"talkid":77334,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797596#t19797596","upictitle":"Zack: knytt stories bird","article":"So glad this is on PS3 as well as PS4, it's gonna be another year at least before I buy a PS4.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 4 2014, 21:03:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bungeebot","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bungeebot","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bungeebot","ctime_ts":1417726991,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120656536/63144055","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797852#t19797852","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797852#t19797852","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797852#t19797852","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1767677","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/robert.dargenzio","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19797852,"talkid":77335,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393308.html?thread=19797852#t19797852","upictitle":"Robert Dargenzio: pic#120656536","article":"I must say, as a great fan of stories, that I am absolutely thrilled to finally have a game of thrones game that lives up to the name. I've played both the cyanide game of thrones RPG on ps3 and game of thrones genesis (Strategy game) on the PC. Although the RPG did have a few memorable moments it was somewhat of a disappointment, although I did enjoy the maester Martin cameo, which was basically you with another voice who answer a bunch of questions about the lore of the world. The strategy game genesis was a better game and pretty entertaining for a few hours, especially marrying your kids and bastards to make alliances. However neither game did justice to your story or world. <br /><br />After playing telltales game I am glad to say that there is a finally a game that lives up to the game of thrones brand. Fans of either the book or series, in my opinion, will undoubtedly enjoy this game. For those of you reading this that are unfamiliar with telltale (the game developer) their games are like an interactive TV show. They release their games as seasons, and each season generally has 5 episodes which release generally within a month or two apart. Also each episode is generally 2 hours long. So this game with all 5 episodes will be just as long if not longer than a season of game of thrones on HBO. They're great value as well. $5 an episode or $20 a season. <br /><br />But anyways I just wanted to say I'm really happy about this game and enjoyed the first episode. Congratulations on another success and thank you for the many hours of my life you personally (or your mind) have given me.<br /><br />Also thanks for world of ice and fire book, it kicks major ass. <br /><br />Have a weird question for you if you have time to answer.<br />Will there ever be more info on the winged men, and will we see any of their ilk in the final two books? Ever since I've seen the city of winged men I've always wondered what's up with them. I wonder if they really fly, or do they just shoot living people out of catapults and have parachutes.

It's entertaining watching the thought people put into making the various decisions they're presented with: stuff like whether to show mercy to a thief and deserter, demonstrating kindness and hopefully winning the love of your subjects but potentially leading others to think you're soft and trying their own luck at deserting/stealing, or whether to hack off his fingers, demonstrating strength but also showing yourself as cold-blooded and potentially condemning the man's family to starvation when the winter comes. <br /><br />In most fantasy settings, the first approach would probably be the favored one. In Westeros, where things tend to be a bit more cynical, I imagine that any lord choosing to pardon a thief caught red-handed would be looked on as contemptibly weak and his perceived weakness taken advantage of by others.
