{"itemid":679,"subject":"Steaming Along","event":"I've realized that I have been remiss here in talking about the FEVRE DREAM comic, which made its debut in April at the C2E2 show in Chicago, and has been steaming along merrily ever since, releasing a new issue every month, dagnabit (sorry, channeling my inner Abner there), unlike certain other comics with which I have been connected.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0009x1p3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0009x1p3/s320x240\" width=\"155\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe comic, of course, is an adaptation of my 1982 historical horror novel about vampires on antebellum Mississippi river steamboats.  \"Bram Stoker meets Mark Twain,\" one might say, or even \"Huck Finn Meets Dracula.\"  Something like that.  The book was pretty well received, anyway.  A finalist for the World Fantasy Award in its day.  (Lost to Michael Shea's NIFFT THE LEAN.  I never win the novel prizes).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000crbeg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000crbeg/s320x240\" width=\"155\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe comic is being published by William Christensen and his team at Avatar Press.  Script and adaptation by my friend and sometime collaborator Daniel Abraham (one my partners on HUNTER'S RUN, creator of Jonathan Hive in the Wild Cards universe, and author of THE LONG PRICE QUARTET, the best damned fantasy that too few of you have read), who has done a terrific and very faithful translation.  Art by Rafa Lopez, pride of Malaga, Spain.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000cs0a7/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000cs0a7/s320x240\" width=\"155\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe first four issues should be available right now in any good comics shop, with the fifth issue due out soon.  (And if your local comic shop doesn't have them, then it's not a GOOD comics shop, is it?).  The miniseries will run to ten issues, so we're almost halfway home.  No year-long delays between issues are anticipated.  The whole story is done and in the can, penciled, inked, colored, everything.\r\n\r\nAnd I promise you: my vamps suck, but they don't sparkle.","ditemid":173935,"eventtime":"2010-08-13 23:08:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":290,"taglist":"fevre dream, comics","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"commentalter":1348358259,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"18:7,31:3,11:9,42:7,29:5,3:56,5:5,25:5,4:35,20:3,9:20,13:3,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-08-14 05:08:54","anum":111,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html","event_timestamp":1281740880,"reply_count":32,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html?replyto=10952815","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html?thread=10952815#t10952815","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html?thread=10952815#t10952815","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html?thread=10952815#t10952815","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html?thread=10952815#t10952815","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lexicopia","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lexicopia.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10952815,"talkid":42784,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/173935.html?thread=10952815#t10952815","upictitle":"lexicopia: pic#103041885","article":"I'm actually half-way through the book right now, and loving it.

I now own a battered paperback copy which I've read several times (this during my study years, that is, in times when I have <i>no time</i> and will often be reading the same book on the train from summer holidays back to school as I do on the train from term finals to Christmas holidays...). I've tried to make people around me read it. Alas, people around me are as busy as I and less interested in fantasy. (If it doesn't sparkle. Silly sparkle. Silly people.)<br /><br />But in any case, let me just drop in a thanks to you, Mr Martin, for this jewel of a book. The gruff character of Abner Marsh caught me from his first introduction, and the setting comes alive off the page. Most of all I love the flow of the language; I can't read this book without skipping back to reread favourite passages here and there, just for the pleasure of them, much like I might read poetry.<br /><br />(\"Dying of the Light\" had a few passages like those, too. Another wonderful book. Will there be a comic?)<br /><br />As for the \"Fevre\" comics, I'll wait for a hardcover omnibus or what's-its-name with all the issues inside. As I said, I'm a big fan of the written word, and I always feel something is missing in comic adaptations, even if they're good. If I like a book enough I'll get the comic \"just to have it\".
