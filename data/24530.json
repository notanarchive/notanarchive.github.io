{"itemid":95,"subject":"Two Wins in One Day","event":"Life is magical and full of joy.\r\n\r\nSomehow both of my teams won today.  The Giants defeated the Detroit Lions in the morning... just barely, admittedly, but a win is a win, and I'll take it.  And then somehow the Jets won as well, against a very good Pittsburgh Steeler team.  That one shocked even me.  I have never believed that the Jets were as bad as their record suggested and I figured they'd pull out of the tailspin and win one sooner or later, but I never expected it to be against the Steelers, supposedly the third best team in the AFC.  I'll take that one too, however.  The Jets D stepped up big, and Mangini took advantage of the bye week to install a number of nice new wrinkles and schemes.  \r\n\r\nOf course, the hated Cowboys and despised Patriots both won huge, so the day wasn't perfect.\r\n\r\nThe G-Men look to be in pretty good position for a wild card, though they had several costly injuries today.  For four years in a row the Giants have been crippled by injuries in the second half of the season, one of the big factors in their late season collapses.  This year they have been relatively injury-free, so seeing Kiwi and Brandon go down produced deep forebodings.  I fear Kiwi is lost for the year, though I hope Jacobs can return soon.  If not, I hope Coughlin gives this kid Bradshaw some carries to spell Reuben Droughns.  He showed a lot of flashes in pre-season, and could have the makings of another Tiki Barber, if he can only learn to hold on to the ball.  I also wish Coughlin would sit down Plaxico Burress for a couple of games.  It's plain that his ankle is getting worse.  He's playing with pain and without practice.  Let him sit on the bench for two or three weeks and heal.  Go with Amani Toomer and Sinorice Moss, Steve Smith if he's healthy, and bring back that kid Anthony Mix.  Mix is raw, but has the size, and pretty good hands too.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets... well, I don't expect they'll be able to stay with the hated Cowboys on Turkey Day, or with the despised Patriots later on, but they will probably win a few more before the season is done... just enough to make sure they don't get a top five draft pick.  Sigh.  Kellen Clemens showed promise today, Thomas Jones finally looked like the runner he was supposed to be, the O-line and D-line both played well... but Leon Washington won the game.  Amazing how the Steelers schemed to avoid kicking to Leon all game long, only to punt it straight at him in overtime, with the game on the line.  He made them pay.  Let's send Leon to the Pro Bowl...","ditemid":24530,"eventtime":"2007-11-18 23:26:00","props":{"commentalter":1292888589,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-11-19 06:46:47","anum":210,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html","event_timestamp":1195428360,"reply_count":41,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/57032337/7160335","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?replyto=2765266","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2765266#t2765266","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2765266#t2765266","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2765266#t2765266","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"after_nightfall","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://after-nightfall.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2765266,"talkid":10801,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2765266#t2765266","upictitle":"After Nightfall: spring","article":"From \"meaningless and has no purpose\" to \"magical and full of joy\" in two days. :-) ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"November 19 2007, 07:10:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://after-nightfall.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"after_nightfall","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"after_nightfall","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://after-nightfall.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"after_nightfall","ctime_ts":1195456247,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/57796565/1591304","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?replyto=2766546","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2766546#t2766546","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2766546#t2766546","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2766546#t2766546","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thewlisian_afer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thewlisian-afer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2766546,"talkid":10806,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2766546#t2766546","above":2765266,"upictitle":"|V|άςβε@η: [me] books","article":"I love that.

I'm not a raving fan by any stretch, but I sort of keep up with a few teams and watch it on the occasional lazy Saturday.  I guess what keeps me from pro ball is my perceived lack of \"heart\" from the game itself.  Everything is so commercial, it seems the coaches are ignored by players and the players themselves are traded around to the point I can't imagine anyone having any kind of team loyalty.  <br />While I understand college ball has also become increasingly commercial, there has always seemed to me to be a certain core of something real in college ball that pro ball simply cannot have.

Only the finest college athletes make it to the pro circuit, so play is faster and cleaner. <br /><br />More to the point, though, every game in the pros is an actual game, whereas a good number on the college circuit are simply parades. Even a school with a \"tough\" schedule spends about a third of its season walloping creampuffs who can't recruit high-caliber talent. If you think about good college games, it's always between powerhouse schools who draw from the best talent pool. In the NFL, everyone has access to the same people, and thanks to the hard salary cap, everyone has the same financial chance to get them. That's why there's only one regular-season undefeated team in NFL history. There's one most years in college. (That said, this year's Patriots may be an exception)<br /><br />Commercially, colleges make incredible amounts of money by earning spots in bowl games, which frequently involves running up the score on lesser opponents to increase their rankings. Of course, none of that money goes to the players who earn it, thanks to the NCAA, one of the most ruthless monopolies on the planet.<br /><br />Lastly, loyalty. No player stays with a college for more than four years, by law. And you better believe that if a player feels his odds of getting NFL attention go up by transferring, he's gone before his sweat-towel dries. Also, coaches at big schools often have shorter tenures than in the NFL, and always get while the gettin's good. Witness Urban Meyer, given his big break by Utah, takes them to the Sugar Bowl, then promptly bails to move to Florida (personal bitterness there).<br /><br />So, the college game is no bed of roses, the NCAA just does a good whitewashing job.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","below":2777298,"ctime":"November 19 2007, 18:06:40 UTC","parent":2769362,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Pro Football","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://phillip-ii.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"phillip_ii","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"phillip_ii","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://phillip-ii.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"phillip_ii","ctime_ts":1195495600,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2777298#t2777298","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2777298#t2777298","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2777298#t2777298","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trutwijd","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trutwijd.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2777298,"talkid":10848,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2777298#t2777298","above":2772434,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","parent":2769362,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Pro Football","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://trutwijd.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"trutwijd","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"trutwijd","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://trutwijd.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"trutwijd","ctime_ts":1195529880,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/111837429/7604503","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?replyto=2769618","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2769618#t2769618","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2769618#t2769618","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2769618#t2769618","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nestdweller","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nestdweller.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2769618,"talkid":10818,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/24530.html?thread=2769618#t2769618","upictitle":"Snag: Surprise!","article":"I don't follow football (or anything else), with any avid regularity, I just have my home teams that I watch if I happen to catch them, and I'm good to go.
