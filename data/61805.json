{"itemid":241,"subject":"Vance Book Delivered","event":"The Jack Vance tribute anthology, SONGS OF THE DYING EARTH, is complete, and has been delivered to our publishers at Subterranean Press, Tor Books, HarperCollins Voyager (in the UK), and Luitingh (n the Netherlands).  Other foreign editions will no doubt follow.  Jack Vance has a worldwide readership.\r\n\r\nMy co-editor Gardner Dozois and I are very proud of this one.  The Dying Earth is one of the great settings in fantasy, right up there with Howard's Hyborian Age and Tolkien's Middle Earth, and it was great to be able to visit there again.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0001drw7/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0001drw7/s320x240\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd the Subterranean Press edition, which will feature full-page interior illustrations by Tom Kidd for each story, looks to be especially nifty.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0001w83z/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0001w83z/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nCopies of the limited edition are still available through the SubPress website at http://www.subterraneanpress.com/\r\n\r\nSo that's one project off the plate.  \r\n\r\nNow all I need to do is wrap up WARRIORS and SUICIDE KINGS and... yes... A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, and maybe I'll be able to take a week off.  (The reason they call them deadlines is because they're like to kill you).\r\n\r\nI'll keep you posted.","ditemid":61805,"eventtime":"2008-12-08 23:08:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":192,"taglist":"subterranean, vance, dying earth","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1229303600,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-12-09 06:18:54","anum":109,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61805.html","event_timestamp":1228777680,"reply_count":50,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/6290649/1176641","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61805.html?replyto=4791405","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61805.html?thread=4791405#t4791405","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61805.html?thread=4791405#t4791405","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61805.html?thread=4791405#t4791405","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"laughingfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://laughingfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4791405,"talkid":18716,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/61805.html?thread=4791405#t4791405","upictitle":"LaughingFalcon: pic#6290649","article":"     Thanks for the warning on deadlines.

George, I hope I am reading this the wrong way and ADWD has not moved from a story you obviously loved to something you regard as a chore. Again I hope I am wrong but when I read the updates you give on your other projects I can feel your excitement about them, and I just don't see that anymore with your ADWD updates.<br /><br />So in short I really hope you still enjoy this series as much as your fans do and if you don't, take a break.

After all, it's taken eight years to write what is essentially one book (since AFFC and ADWD was originally supposed to be one) when there were only two-year gaps in between Game, Clash, and Storm.<br /><br />I don't know if Mr. Martin has fallen out of love with the series that has allowed him the clout to be able to take up all these pet projects, or that he's TOO in love with the world he's created.  So much so that he has to explore parts/characters that intrigue him and has thus FORCED them to be part of the main story arc (Dorne, Iron Islands, Brienne) to justify their taking up room.  Maybe he fell so much in love with it that he became stuck.  He wandered away from the original story and now has all these plotlines dangling and is a bit overwhelmed.  All any of us can do is speculate and hope.<br /><br />I'll still buy the book whenever it's released, but it's more out of dedication to what was than any form of excitement.  The excitement that had me read, then re-read, then re-re-read, then re-re-re-read the then-trilogy has waned.  I haven't even re-read AFFC yet, because honestly, if Mr. Martin doesn't care about his series that much anymore why should I?<br /><br />He's had time to work on or put out 5 Wild Card books, 4 anthologies, re-released The Ice Dragon, write a novella which he then lengthened into a novel (Shadow Twin/Hunters Run) with Dozois and Abraham, and write two more Dunk and Egg stories ... in the same amount of time that he's produced technically one half of a novel of his best-selling series.  <br /><br />Mr. Martin, I love your series and still recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I hope you find the love again sometime soon.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"December 10 2008, 19:10:35
