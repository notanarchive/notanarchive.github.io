{"itemid":481,"subject":"Giants Crush","event":"Well, that was fun.  If only every game was like this...\r\n\r\n(Maybe it is, if you're a Colts fan).\r\n\r\nThese were the Giants I remember.  The swarming aggressive D, the sacks, the knockdowns, the hurries, the interceptions, runners tackled at the line of scrimmage.  And on offense, long time-consuming drives ending in touchdowns.  Eli looked terrific, spreading the ball around.  Nicks, Smith, Manningham, and Boss all had big catches, and even Derek Hagan scored a touchdown.  The running game was back, especially when Ahmad Bradshaw had the ball.  The O line opened gaping holes, and the D line was so relentless that our wafer-thin secondary was never threatened.\r\n\r\nYeah, these were the real G-Men.\r\n\r\nI have no idea who those clowns in the Redskins uniforms were.\r\n\r\nThat fake field goal the Skins tried at the end of the first half had to be one of the most bizarre plays I've ever seen.  Watching Steve Young talk about it in the postgame was hilarious.\r\n\r\nI do feel sorry for Jim Zorn, whose postgame press conference was... well, obviously, no one ever taught the guy Coachspeak.  Poor guy is not long for D.C.\r\n\r\nBut it was a great win.\r\n\r\nNow we need two more like it, coupled with a Cowboys loss.\r\n\r\n(Or a Packers loss, maybe... but while I know the G-Men have the tiebreaker over Dallas, no one has ever mentioned who wins a tie between New York and Green Bay).\r\n\r\nNext week, the Panthers.  Who beat the Vikings yesterday.  Let's hope the real G-Men show up.","ditemid":123293,"eventtime":"2009-12-21 23:42:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1262018738,"personifi_word_count":265,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:9,18:13,35:9,6:4,11:13,16:9,3:18,24:4,25:13,19:4,9:27,21:4,13:13,14:4","interface":"flat","revnum":1,"revtime":1261464222},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-22 06:43:00","anum":157,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html","event_timestamp":1261438920,"reply_count":37,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/38166420/1322587","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html?replyto=8143517","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html?thread=8143517#t8143517","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html?thread=8143517#t8143517","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html?thread=8143517#t8143517","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html?thread=8143517#t8143517","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"doesi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://doesi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8143517,"talkid":31810,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123293.html?thread=8143517#t8143517","upictitle":"Ford &quot;Rommel-I-Read-Your-Book&quot; Pendleton: [EMOFACE SHOCKED]","article":"Yes yes, we're quite aware that our Redskins have taken a leave of wit this past... erm... decade...<br /><br />I pity Zorn too, but he lost Detroit.

It's a little flash app that lets you muck around with the remaining games to see how the playoffs would change based on different scenarios.<br /><br />If Dallas, New York and Green Bay win out, the G-Men are left out looking in. If NY and GB win out, but Dallas loses either remaining game, the Giants get in. If NY and Dallas win out, but GB drops a game, then the Giants also get in. <br /><br />There are a few crazy variations, involving Dallas and GB losing out, that also get the Giants in (so long as they win one out of two), but that doesn't seem likely.<br /><br />Under what I think is the most likely scenario, all three teams in the hunt win next week (Dallas over Washington, GB over Seattle, Giants over Carolina). In Week 17, the Giants must beat Minnesota, then hope that Philly beats the Cowboys or GB falls to Arizona. If that happens, they are in. <br /><br />So it's possible, but we need help.<br /><br />The AFC is a complete mess. After this week's games, things will become clearer. A bunch of the 7-7 teams have critical games that will eliminate some of them for sure. I was playing around with those scenarios for about an hour last night.
