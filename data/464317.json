{"itemid":1813,"subject":"Last Year (Jean Cocteau)","event":"I had a whole page about the Jean Cocteau on my Lost Post.  A look back at an amazing year.  All the author events, the magic shows, the concerts and comedy acts, the burlesque shows, the special events, the film festivals, the retrospectives, the television premieres, the marathons... and of course the<i><b> movies</b></i>.\r\n\r\nWith picture.  Lots and lots of pictures.\r\n\r\nSorry, but I don't have the patience to re-create it all again.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that we had a great time at the Jean Cocteau Cinema in 2015, and we're hoping that 2016 will be even more exciting under our new general manager, David Sidebottom.  \r\n\r\nWe are certainly off to a good start.  HATEFUL 8 opened with a sellout.  Yay!\r\n\r\nOh, though I won't rehash the entire year, I do want to mention some things we're especially proud of.  The Jean Cocteau dared to show THE INTERVIEW when all five of the country's major chains caved in to threats from North Korea.  Not only did we pack the house for weeks, we received a special unanimous commendation from the New Mexico state legislature for defending free speech.  \r\n\r\nOh, and several weeks later, we defied the local prudes by showing Lina Esco's film FREE THE NIPPLE, though we had to fight to get our ads published.  (We also freed some nipples in the theatre on opening night).  Plus we were the only theatre in New Mexico to show INTERSTELLAR the way director Christopher Nolan wanted it shown, on 35mm film.  \r\n\r\nSo I am proud of all that.  And of the Cocteau in general.  Come visit us if you're ever in Santa Fe.  Our popcorn is great too.","ditemid":464317,"eventtime":"2016-01-01 16:47:00","props":{"current_mood":"accomplished","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"anthologies, awards","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Jan  1 23:46:34 2016]R [Fri Jan  1 23:46:36 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683071858577571845 ","current_moodid":90,"commentalter":1451843496,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683071858577571845","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.678216962138011]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451692190}","revtime":1451938132},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-01 23:46:31","anum":189,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html","event_timestamp":1451666820,"reply_count":7,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23441597#t23441597","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23441597#t23441597","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23441597#t23441597","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3451545","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/117666133658074256616","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23441597,"talkid":91568,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23441597#t23441597","upictitle":"Andrew Wright: pic#0","article":"Dear Ser George,<br /><br />Just wanted to say thank you for everything you do at the Cocteau. I have not had the opportunity to go myself as I live across the country, but there are so few theaters left that make cinema about more than just ticket sales. (If you are ever in the Boston area you should swing by the Somerville Theater, by the way, which seems like a kindred spirit of the Cocteau!)<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see Hateful 8 as part of the roadshow and the experience was breathtaking. The moment when the overture ended and the sound faded and you could hear that old projector clicking in the background was almost worth it in and of itself.<br /><br />I mainly come here looking for information about the ASOIAF books, but always enjoy hearing what's coming up at the Cocteau. So thank you!<br /><br />Happy new year, <br /><br />Drew<br /><br />P.S. Can't wait to make the trek to El Paso for a screening of the GAME OF THRONES movie in a few years, if all goes well.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 1 2016, 23:54:59 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Hateful 8...and Thank You!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/117666133658074256616","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Andrew Wright","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3451545","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77247700&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Andrew Wright","ctime_ts":1451692499,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125733914/77255692","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23443901#t23443901","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23443901#t23443901","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23443901#t23443901","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3453676","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ladykanayo","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23443901,"talkid":91577,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464317.html?thread=23443901#t23443901","upictitle":"ladyK: pic#125733914","article":"I'm coming to Jean Cocteau thus year!
