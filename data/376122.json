Dangerous women got me into the dresden files which I have since read them all. Now rogues is out and after reading Gillian flynns story I'm ready to pick up one of her books as well (she had me cracking up most of her story and I didn't see the twist coming). So I just wanted to say thanks to Gardner Dozois and yourself. You've broadened my horizons and not only that but have slowly molded me into an avid reader. Like tyrion I catch myself reading to nearly dawn then realize I have a million things to do in the morning but can't sleep without another page, another chapter or another story. I've lived a thousand lives since I picked up your book so again thank you Mr Martin ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"June 20 2014, 09:05:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Amazing ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/robert.dargenzio","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Robert Dargenzio","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1767677","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=63144055&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"June 20 2014, 09:12:58 UTC","dname":"Robert Dargenzio","ctime_ts":1403255128,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123159364/51668725","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/376122.html?replyto=19295034","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/376122.html?thread=19295034#t19295034","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/376122.html?thread=19295034#t19295034","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/376122.html?thread=19295034#t19295034","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1340308","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://polycrafter.wordpress.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19295034,"talkid":75371,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/376122.html?thread=19295034#t19295034","upictitle":"Polycrafter: Paprika","article":"LOVED learning more about Dareon's story!
