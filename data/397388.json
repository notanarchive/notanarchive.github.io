{"itemid":1552,"subject":"Sony and the Interview, Once More","event":"Discussions of North Korea, cyber war, the corporate cowardice of Sony Pictures, and THE INTERVIEW have been taking over the airwaves these past two days, and millions of words have been devoted to the issues.&nbsp; I won&#39;t try to rehash them all here.\r\n\r\nThe most important words, and the truest words, were those spoken by the big man, President Obama.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"528\" />\r\n\r\nI agree with everything the President said there.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important bits, in my opinion, is toward the middle, where he talks about the chilling effect the cowardice of Sony and the big movie chains could have on other filmmakers going forward.&nbsp; This is a point that very few of the talking heads on television seem to be addressing.&nbsp; It is not theoretical.&nbsp; <b><i>THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING.</i></b> The damage has already extended well beyond THE INTERVIEW itself.&nbsp; Paramount, a studio that has NOT been hacked, and has NOT been threatened, has already reacted by pulling TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE from all the theatres that wanted to show it as a substitute for THE INTERVIEW.&nbsp; They have made no public statement as to their reasons, but I think their reasons are plain... they are afraid of drawing down the wrath on North Korea and the hackers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, New Regency and Fox -- neither of them part of the Sony hack, neither of them theatened -- have scrapped plans forPYONGYANG,&nbsp; a Steve Carrell movie about North Korea, based on a popular graphic novle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/good-north-korea-movie-pyongyang-guy-delisle.html\r\n\r\nThis a textbook example of &quot;chilling effect.&quot;&nbsp; Nothing could be more clearcut.&nbsp; Not just one Seth Rogen/ James Franco ( or Flacco) movie has been impacted, but three different projects, one ten years old, one still in preproduction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;Of course, Sony has taken issue with the president&#39;s declaration that they &quot;made a mistake.&quot;&nbsp; (A very mild way of putting it, in my opinion.)&nbsp; No, no, they did not make a mistake, they are insisting, they had no choice.&nbsp; Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton instead tried to shift the blame to Regal, AMC, and the other movie chains who announced that they would not not screen the film.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered, and we haven&#39;t backed down. We have always had the desire to have the American public see this movie,&quot; Lynton said.\r\n\r\nSorry, but that&#39;s bullshit.&nbsp; Sony did have a choice.&nbsp; They still do.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can release the film tomorrow, if they want.\r\n\r\nSony is correct in one regard: the big movie chains are getting off way too easy here.&nbsp; All the discussion has focused on Sony, but in fact the cowardice started with Regal, with AMC, and&nbsp; the other monarchs of the multiplex who decided to bow to the threats and pull THE INTERVIEW from their screens.&nbsp; But for Sony to suggest that once that happened they &quot;had no place to show the film,&quot; is disingenuous.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the Jean Cocteau Cinema will show THE INTERVIEW here in Santa Fe, should it be made available to us.&nbsp; And yes, we&#39;re a tiny little arthouse, only 125 seats... but the crucial point is, <b><i>we would not have been alone</i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to NATO (the National Association of Theatre Owners, not the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), there are 39,662 movie screens in the United States.&nbsp; Regal, the largest and most powerful of the chains, has 7318 of those.&nbsp; The other big chains have thousands too, but...\r\n\r\nDo the math.&nbsp; There are still THOUSANDS of screens out there not under the control of the mega-chains.&nbsp; Smaller chains, regional chains, arthouses, and many many many small independent movie theatres like my own... theatres that would have jumped at the chance to show a big Christmas movie, an opportunity not often afforded them.&nbsp; Regal may have been intimidated, but I don&#39;t think Alamo Drafthouse would have been.&nbsp; I suspect Quention Tarantino and his New Beverly Theatre in LA would have stepped up, he&#39;s no stranger to controversy.&nbsp; And there are thousands more.&nbsp; So don&#39;t give us this &quot;boo hoo, we have no choice, no one would have showed our movie&quot; okey-doke, Sony, because it&#39;s not true.&nbsp; The<b><i> INDEPENDENTS</i></b> would have showed your film.&nbsp; We still will.&nbsp; Release it, and see.\r\n\r\nRachel Maddow did an excellent story last night about the parallels between THE INTERVIEW case and the SATANIC VERSES incident, when Iran declared a fatwa against Salman Rushdie, threatening to kill not only the author but also his editors and publishers.&nbsp; It is worth remembering that, in that case as in this, the big chains were the first to cave.&nbsp; Waldenbooks, B. Daltons, and Barnes &amp; Noble all responded by announcing that they would not be selling THE SATANIC VERSES.&nbsp;&nbsp; But... here&#39;s the important part...Rushdie&#39;s publishers did not flinch, but stood firm for the book, the author, and the principle of free speech.&nbsp; And who stood with them?&nbsp; The <b><i>independent bookstores</i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the shops around the corner, the specialty stores, the mom-and-pop operations came forth and said, almost as one, &quot;We&#39;ll sell your book.&quot;&nbsp; And they did, in unprecedented numbers.&nbsp; THE SATANIC VERSES was a huge bestseller, not because of the chains, but in spite of them.\r\n\r\nMaybe Regal is afraid is to show THE INTERVIEW.&nbsp; The CEOs in the corporate suites are too scared by what their lawyers are whispering in their ears about potential liability.&nbsp; But mom and pop have more guts, I&#39;d bet.&nbsp; Release THE INTERVIEW, Sony, and hundreds of small chains and indy theatres will snap it up all across the country.\r\n\r\nAnd hey, Paramount, we&#39;d snap up TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE as well.&nbsp; So climb out from underneath your desks, and make it available for us to book.&nbsp;","ditemid":397388,"eventtime":"2014-12-20 11:05:00","props":{"current_mood":"still testy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"politics, censorship, movie theatre","homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1419235143,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Sony and the Interview, Once More http://j.mp/1x7jK8n","picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.695465521056394]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1419098698}","revtime":1419236026},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-12-20 18:04:19","anum":76,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html","event_timestamp":1419073500,"reply_count":69,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124371853/73614124","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19943244#t19943244","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19943244#t19943244","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19943244#t19943244","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2928170","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/joe.louis.756","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19943244,"talkid":77903,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19943244#t19943244","article":"Couldn't agree more George.

Back then, network security wasn't as much of a concern because hackers back then succeeded more utilizing social engineering. However, we did a good job creating policies that made it more difficult to social engineer your way into sensitive systems. <br /><br />AND THEN THEY FIRED/DOWNSIZED US and hired younger people, with less experience and education, to replace us. And of course paid them less... and hired a lot less of them. Not to mention, these upper managers had no understanding of the work these IT people were doing to begin with... they only saw dollars disappearing in IT departments but had no way to qualify how much those IT departments were SAVING THEM in potential revenue losses. <br /><br />Today you have tens of thousands of former IT security experts who simply left the field. People who were great at their jobs... who had decades of experience and were critical thinkers. Millennials, by and large, are not critical thinkers, I am sorry to say. They're a good bunch of kids who are very accepting of the differences in people, but they're just not great at problem solving. And that's my generation's fault for raising them that way; we overcompensated for the terrible way Baby Boomers raised us, and held the hands of our kids for too long. <br /><br />So that's how we got to this point. You have overcompensating Gen-X executives, who DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT SECURITY, hiring Millennials who can't think their way out of a box --and paying them next to nothing to do it- who live in an over-reactionary world where people expect you to FIX IT NOW, even if it makes no sense.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 20 2014, 18:16:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Many IT people predicted this a decade ago","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"GeekFurious","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2058420","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=65344279&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"GeekFurious","ctime_ts":"1419099371","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123647516/71499470","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19944012#t19944012","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19944012#t19944012","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19944012#t19944012","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"anoyinmom","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://anoyinmom.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19944012,"talkid":77906,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/397388.html?thread=19944012#t19944012","upictitle":"anoyinmom: Okay","article":"Well stated!

I strongly suspect that the hackers have made threats of more information revelation if Sony releases the film anywhere.  We don't know what those threats are but I doubt the hackers have used up all their ammunition.  <br /><br />Their tactics worked.  And so we can expect to see the same internet terrorism deployed again and again.  <br /><br />I've been watching in horror what has befallen Brianna Wu and her release of her game Revolution 60 as the 'gamergate' people have targeted her.  The same internet terrorism tactics focused on Sony were used on her as an individual.  She has been subjected to photos of her home with rape threats, mocking of her grief at her dog dying, publishing of her personal information, and changing the Wikipedia articles about her and her spouse in damaging ways. She's had to raise funds to hire someone to watch her back on the internet simply so she can devote time to being a game designer instead of constantly defending herself.<br /><br />I don't know where it ends.
