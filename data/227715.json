Just wanted to say that you were my introduction to the fantasy genre and because of ASOIF, I plan to read Tolkien and the Dune series, and many others. Can't wait to spend the weekend in doors to read A Dance With Dragons. I also wanted to say as a female I think its pretty remarkable how you write and describe so eloquently your female characters. I don't know if I would be able to write about men the way you write about women. Truly a gift. Daenerys, Brienne, Arya, etc. are the shit and I love how many of your females have such diverse personalities and backgrounds.
