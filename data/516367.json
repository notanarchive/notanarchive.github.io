I have a question on the new dunk and egg graphic novel mystery knight. when do you think it will come out?<br />also what do you think of the game of thrones video games!<br />I loved the telltale series, it was great and the game of thrones game before that for ps3 was well it could of been great, but it was just average, I loved it, but it just felt like it needed an open world field. Have you ever thought of talking to anyone about making an open world game set in your universe and planetos.<br /><br />games that I love the most are skyrim, fallout,watchdogs, and gta, I love open world games, games also made me interested in learning how to make games and code.<br />Have a great day<br />Shade","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"January 19 2017, 20:24:13 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"previous post that you made grrm","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/111623038371705370228","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"That white guy who&#39;s a little crazy lol","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3980615","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=80582998&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"January 19 2017, 20:58:15 UTC","dname":"That white guy who&#39;s a little crazy lol","ctime_ts":1484857453,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119183883/53929219","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516367.html?thread=25623055#t25623055","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516367.html?thread=25623055#t25623055","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516367.html?thread=25623055#t25623055","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1469246","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/110199483365422492937","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25623055,"talkid":100090,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/516367.html?thread=25623055#t25623055","above":25622031,"upictitle":"John Vizcarra: pic#119183883","article":"It's available for pre-order now.
