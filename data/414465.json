{"itemid":1619,"subject":"My Night With Sibel","event":"The lovely and talented SIBEL KEKILLI -- best known to all you GAME OF THRONES fans out there for her amazing portrayal of Shae -- came to Santa Fe last December.&nbsp; We celebrated her visit by screening HEAD ON, the breakthrough German film that gave Sibel her first starring role and won her the Lola (the German Oscar) for Best Actress, but that was not the main purpose of her visit.&nbsp; She was here to film a segment of a popular German travel show DURCH DIE NACHT (roughly, INTO THE NIGHT), for the French/ German TV network ARTE.\r\n\r\nThe premise is the show is that each week, a celebrity visits some place they have never been before, and a local shows them the town, with an emphasis on the nightlfife.&nbsp; Sibel asked me to show her Santa Fe, and I was delighted to say yes ( though I did warn her that Santa Fe, for all its charms, does tend to roll up the sidewalks at 9:00 pm or so).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So after a rather adventurous series of flight, and a six-hour drive through the night with a stranger in a car full of fish, Sibel made it to the Land of Enchantment, and I had the honor of playing her host.&nbsp; We took in my own lair, a local gallery, a comic book shop, two restaurants, two bars, and of course the Jean Cocteau.&nbsp; (With a film crew trailing us everywhere we went).\r\n\r\nI had a great time.&nbsp; Got to introduce Sibel to margaritas and chile con queso, two of my favorite things.&nbsp; All in all, she seemed to enjoy the experience.&nbsp; And driving around through the night, we talked about all manner of things, which was fun as well.\r\n\r\nThe segment has now been edited and broadcast.&nbsp; For those of you not in France and Germany who did not get to see it, here you go:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"556\"/>\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve met some wonderful people through GAME OF THRONES, and Sibel is one of them.&nbsp; What an amazing, talented, courageous young woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes, I confess it: her Shae was better than my Shae.\r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, here&#39;s that song I had them sing for Sibel -- Istanbul, Not Constantinople, by the Four Lads.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"557\"/>","ditemid":414465,"eventtime":"2015-03-26 14:23:00","props":{"current_mood":"delighted","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"travel, television, santa fe, game of thrones","homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1428346434,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" My Night With Sibel http://j.mp/1IA6gDL","picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":3,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.664861747141016]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428422357}","revtime":1428422337},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-26 20:22:59","anum":1,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/414465.html","event_timestamp":1427379780,"reply_count":39,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124703379/74668564","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/414465.html?thread=20505345#t20505345","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/414465.html?thread=20505345#t20505345","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/414465.html?thread=20505345#t20505345","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3051608","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/tokaram1","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20505345,"talkid":80099,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/414465.html?thread=20505345#t20505345","upictitle":"LA-MJ: pic#124703379","article":"D&D changed the character.

For some reason eating cactus fascinated me.<br /><br />From an article about both Turkey and Game of Thrones a few months back:<br /><br />\"Four military officers were discharged from the army after they let their students watch “Game of Thrones” at a military school in Istanbul in 2012.<br /><br />\"The new regulations also lay ground for the introduction of elective classes on Islam in military schools for the first time. The new classes will be based on “basic religious education, the Quran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad.” <br /><br />With all the oil paintings, it would be interesting to know if there once was or still is one of Carl Barks.<br /><br />And about dragons being more realistic with four limbs rather than six. I noticed in the TV-series that they have more than five fingers. Does this annoys you? It made me think that the main difference between fantasy for children and adolescents and more mature fantasy (and horror and science fiction for that matter) is that everything expect the fantasy elements should be as realistic as possible. Then again, we wouldn't have True Blood. If such vampires were possible people would probably line up to be transformed into one. They would think that hiding from the sun and drinking blood would be a small prize to pay for being healthy, fast, strong, immortal and young forever, depending on when you were turned. And you would no longer find blood disgusting. And all the things they could do with their glamming. If someone like Varys had a similar ability, he would be the most powerful man in Westeros. So I didn't feel the vampires used their full potential. But so far I have not noticed anything in Game of Thrones where I was thinking; \"People would never have acted like that in real life\".<br /><br />Edit: I didn't read your latest blog post about off topic comments before after I had posted this one.
