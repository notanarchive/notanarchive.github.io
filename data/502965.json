{"itemid":1964,"subject":"NYC Subway Reads delivers SANDKINGS to commuters #GRRMinion","event":"<u>THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE MINIONS OF FEVRE RIVER</u>\r\n\r\nGood News New Yorkers, last week our friends over at Penguin Random House in conjunction with NYC Subway Transit Wireless rolled out a new program to help ease boredom during your commute. \r\n\r\nAnd here it is, a shiny new link to <a href=\"http://www.subwayreadsny.com\">SUBWAY READS</a> \r\n\r\nOn Sunday, Subway Reads started delivering novellas, short stories or excerpts from full-length books to passengers&rsquo; cellphones or tablets.\r\n\r\nThe idea is for riders to download a short story or a chapter and read it on the train. Subway Reads will even let riders choose what to read based on how long they will be on the subway &mdash; a 10-page selection for a 10-minute ride, a 20-page selection for a 20-minute excursion, a 30-page selection for a 30-minute trip. Delays not included.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the top stories available now to read is GRRM&#39;S chilling horror tale SANDKINGS.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/395256/395256_600.jpg\" title=\"\" />\r\n\r\nAnd here is the <a href=\"http://transitwirelesswifi.com/active-stations/\">LINK</a> leading to the Free Transit Wireless Wifi station map for availability in your area.  \r\n\r\nHappy Reading! \r\n\r\n<u>THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE MINIONS OF FEVRE RIVER</u>","ditemid":502965,"eventtime":"2016-10-19 18:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","taglist":"e-books, sandkings, new yorker","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Oct 20 00:11:34 2016]R [Thu Oct 20 00:11:35 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/788895400778354688 ","current_moodid":15,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1477093244,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/788895400778354688","picture_keyword":"Raya Golden","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.530044442932036],[\"fra\",0.102835366119912]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1476922350}","og_image":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png","revtime":1477513023},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-10-20 00:11:32","anum":181,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/502965.html","event_timestamp":1476900660,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124302622/73354478","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/502965.html?thread=25097397#t25097397","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/502965.html?thread=25097397#t25097397","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/502965.html?thread=25097397#t25097397","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2902334","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25097397,"talkid":98036,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/502965.html?thread=25097397#t25097397","upictitle":"The Dragon Demands: pic#124302622","article":"Hey, *I'm* a NYC Subway patron!
