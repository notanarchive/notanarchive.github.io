{"itemid":1791,"subject":"More Hugo Musings","event":"Speaking of awards, nominations for the 2016 Hugo Awards will be opening soon... so maybe I should post a few more thoughts about some works I think worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nI talked about the two Dramatic Presentation categories in previous posts, and also mentioned NEMESIS GAMES by James S.A. Corey as a possible contender in Best Novel.  Tonight I want to draw your attention to a couple of possibilities for Best Related Work.\r\n\r\nNow, I will freely admit that Best Related Work is not my favorite Hugo category.  It is kind of a grab bag category, the place fandom puts stuff that it likes that doesn't fit anywhere else.  Nobody really seems to have a clear idea what a \"related work\" is... but past nominees have included biographies, autobiographies, essays, critical works, encyclopedias, science books, graphic novels (before there was a graphic novel category), and other, stranger things.  \r\n\r\nThis year, I think there a couple of strong 'related works' worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nTHE WHEEL OF TIME COMPANION was a mammoth concordance of facts about the universe and characters of the late Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series, edited and assembled by Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons.  It's a labor of love, and everything one could possibly want to know about Jordan's universe is in there.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/318935/318935_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nRobert Jordan was a giant in the history of modern fantasy, but during his lifetime he was never nominated for a Hugo, for a Nebula, for a World Fantasy Award (the entire WOT series was nominated at Loncon after his death, but lost).  The COMPANION is worthy of consideration in its own right, I think... and a Hugo for Harriet, Jim's widow and Jim's editor, would be a splendid way to acknowledge his contribution to the genre he loved so much.\r\n\r\nBiographies and memoirs have often contended and won in this category before: Jack Vance's memoir was a recent winner, as was a brilliant biography of Alice Sheldon.  The first volume of William Patterson's Heinlein biography was nominated (though it lost).\r\n\r\nThis year we have something different: Felicia Day's delightful look at her life, YOU'RE NEVER WEIRD ON THE INTERNET (Almost).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/318699/318699_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nNo, Felicia's not an SF writer like Vance or Heinlein or Pohl... but she's certainly an SF person, the queen of the geek girls, an actress, a gamer, a producer.  Her whole life has been lived in and around the worlds of SF and fantasy, and her credits include EUREKA and THE GUILD and DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG and SUPERNATURAL and...  Her book is a lot of fun, witty and wise and insightful... and besides, if she was nominated, maybe she'd come to Kansas City, and it would be a hoot and a half to have Felicia at MidAmericon.\r\n\r\nSo there you are.  Two books to consider when nominating for Best Related Work.  I am sure there's other good stuff out there as well... let's get some of it on the ballot this year.","ditemid":458605,"eventtime":"2015-12-14 23:31:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Dec 12 06:31:03 2015]R [Sat Dec 12 06:31:05 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/675563503692832770 ","current_moodid":30,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1450774471,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/675563503692832770","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.5969582218097]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1449901997}","revtime":1450815888},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-12 06:31:02","anum":109,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html","event_timestamp":1450135860,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116338580/21331","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23237741#t23237741","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23237741#t23237741","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23237741#t23237741","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"livejournal","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://livejournal.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23237741,"talkid":90772,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23237741#t23237741","upictitle":"LiveJournal: rating_bot","article":"Hello!

These games sometimes have a 'golden ending' for groups and characters, the best possible outcome in which everything turns out perfectly. She has no such ending: every possible outcome for her has some level of bittersweetness.

I've been a fan of your blogging since I read your balanced and (corny as it sounds) wise thoughts and suggestions regarding the Hugos of 2015.<br /><br />Regarding other shows that are out of the orbital view of the Hugos: there are some cartoons that have really broken the mold of the Saturday morning kiddie shows. Anime and manga aside (like pushing an 800lb gorilla: anime is the source of some of the most amazing science fiction and fantasy works today), there are three animated shows that both entertain and stretch the bounds of science fiction:<br /><br />Gravity Falls: Cryptids, weirdness and some mind-boggling cryptology hidden in the program. There is a passionate following of cryptologists to this show, as a casual Googling will attest.<br /><br />Steven Universe: Outwardly a simple, charming show about a sensitive nitwit; regular viewing will reveal an epic sub-plot that intrigues and amazes. There is some very sensitive, intimate writing here too (including some of the most subtle gender explorations on the air).<br /><br />Rick and Morty: This show baffles me. The art style and base body-humor make it appear as a run-of-the-mill teenage boy gross-out cartoon. And yet...the creators are undoubtedly science fiction readers and movie fans.  R&M is a science fiction satire on the scale of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe or, a grosser, edgier version of Futurama (itself rife with wonderful sf/f references). Getting beyond the gross-out humor is hard, but once you do, you'll find that the stories have complex science fictional plots and twists. I will admit, though, that getting past that to inspire people to nominate this will be difficult!<br /><br />Thanks again, George!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 15 2015, 19:25:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://furtech.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"furtech","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"furtech","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://furtech.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"furtech","ctime_ts":1450207527,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125312653/76661710","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23270253#t23270253","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23270253#t23270253","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23270253#t23270253","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3262844","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10207499720721364/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23270253,"talkid":90899,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/458605.html?thread=23270253#t23270253","upictitle":"Marco Sartore: pic#125312653","article":"Hello George!
