{"itemid":1976,"subject":"President Pussygrabber","event":"There are really no words for how I feel this morning.\r\n\r\nAmerica has spoken.  I really thought we were better than this.  Guess not.  \r\n\r\nTrump was the least qualified candidate ever nominated by a major party for the presidency.  Come January, he will become the worst president in American history, and a dangerously unstable player on the world stage.  \r\n\r\nAnd the decimated Democrats, a minority in both House and Senate, do not have the power to hinder him.\r\n\r\nOver the next four years, our problems are going to get much, much worse.  \r\n\r\nWinter is coming.  I told you so.","ditemid":506110,"eventtime":"2016-11-09 10:14:00","props":{"medius":1,"current_mood":"depressed","current_location":"Slough of Despond","opt_nocomments":1,"taglist":"politics","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Nov  9 17:13:08 2016]R [Wed Nov  9 17:13:09 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/796400242472075264 ","current_moodid":9,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/796400242472075264","give_features":1,"reading_time":1,"picture_keyword":"distress","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.589378888366696]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1478711611}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1976?v=1478711587"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-09 17:13:05","anum":254,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/506110.html","event_timestamp":1478686440,"reply_count":0}
