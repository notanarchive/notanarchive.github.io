Strangely, I feel confident about the rest of the season.<br />The defense was extremely good but not perfect. Tuck looked healthier than he has in past weeks. Now they just need to adjust to the delays, draws, screens and backs getting open. If 'Boys had run some bootlegs I suspect that those would have worked too. I think they should utilize more run blitzes than the cover blitzes they've been using. <br />Offensively, they need to choose to make a receiver (not necessarily a wide) 'the' threat. Hedgecock has disappeared. Jacobs should be back and that will help but I believe that Boss needs to be emphasized. Bradshaw has not been healthy which has made him a relatively easy tackle and he has not shined in the opportunities he's had this season. Last week he failed to recognize what the defense was doing and adjust. His blocking is not great, he doesn't know how to find the soft spot when he goes out and he drops the ball.  Plus, he's a bit in the doghouse for his indiscretion about going stripclubbing and being with Pierce and Burress. He should have known that he needed to keep his nose in the playbook and his butt at home especially after the offseason he's had. If he were a better receiver they could use him as a scat back. They were looking to Hixon to replace Plax and lets face it, he doesn't have the tools yet. And he's hurt. Seubert and McKenzie are serious issues, but even if they are unable to recover, I think that they have the parts to re-solidify the O-line. Well we'll see if they can do something positive with the offense. <br /><br />So why do I feel good about next week? It's purely based on my belief that they are playing themselves out of the funks and the coaching will adjust appropriately. This is smart team. Even Plax was a smart player. I hope I'm not disappointed next week. When I get upset over the Mets and Giants losing I have trouble sleeping and end up with headaches.

If you'll remember Dallas was missing Tony Romo, Felix Jones, Kyle Kosier, Roy Williams, Terrance Newman, Kevin Burnett, Miles Austin to injury. Also, Jason Witten played but was not effective due to freshly broken ribs a week previous. So that totals 5 injured starters (4 Pro-Bowlers last year) and 3 key back-ups. Star defensive end Justin Tuck was quoted as sayin that the Giants \"don't feel sorry for them\" and that he hoped that they wouldn't use the injuries as an excuse for losing the game. The Giants ended up throttling Dallas that game, but this week it was the reverse. So please spare me all the talk about missing Plax and Jacobs. No excuses remember, besides Dallas didn't have their feature back Marion Barber anywhere near healthy for the game eieher.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"December 16 2008, 16:17:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"How about them Cowboys!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://the-atreides.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"the_atreides","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"the_atreides","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://the-atreides.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"the_atreides","ctime_ts":1229444223,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63031.html?replyto=4840247","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63031.html?thread=4840247#t4840247","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63031.html?thread=4840247#t4840247","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63031.html?thread=4840247#t4840247","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ericreiss","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ericreiss.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4840247,"talkid":18907,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/63031.html?thread=4840247#t4840247","upictitle":"ericreiss: pic#0","article":"I went to kindergarten driving by Dallas Stadium, so I reluctantly admit to being a Cowboys fan.<br /><br />*hides while people pelt him with rocks and garbage*<br /><br />The interesting thing is this:  It will be a hell of a playoff series.
