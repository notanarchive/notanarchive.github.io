{"itemid":1987,"subject":"Wild Cards Website Debuts","event":"Here's some cool news for all the Wild Cards fans out there: Wild Cards has a new home on the web.\r\n\r\nOur brand-new official Wild Cards website debuts today.  (There's been a superb fan site for years at Wild Cards Online, and a great Wild Cards Wikia, and even a Wild Cards Facebook group, but this is the first time in a while that we've had a site that was all our own). \r\n\r\nCheck it out at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wildcardsworld.com/\r\n\r\n(We are still tweaking the site, so please forgive any errors or omissions).\r\n\r\nThere's tons of content there, and we hope to be adding more regularly.   Head on over and explore, and mark it down as a place to visit regularly.\r\n\r\nAnd of course we'd love to hear your thoughts.   What do you think of the place, and what would you like to see us add in the future?  Comments welcome... but ONLY about Wild Cards and the Wild Cards website, please.   Stay on topic.\r\n\r\nClear skies and tailwinds....","ditemid":508920,"eventtime":"2016-11-29 12:41:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Nov 29 19:40:26 2016]R [Tue Nov 29 19:40:28 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/803685071798419456 ","current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1481621102,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/803685071798419456","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"likes_first_notify":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.674288864582921]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1480448474}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1987?v=1481154034","revtime":1481154030},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-29 19:40:24","anum":248,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html","event_timestamp":1480423260,"reply_count":12,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340664#t25340664","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340664#t25340664","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340664#t25340664","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3895439","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/105715750984443106111","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25340664,"talkid":98986,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340664#t25340664","upictitle":"luis iribe: pic#0","article":"It's amazing see how is growing your Job, enjoy :3","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 months ago","ctime":"November 29 2016, 19:42:35 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Congratulation ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/105715750984443106111","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"luis iribe","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3895439","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=79392785&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"luis iribe","ctime_ts":1480448555,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125222114/76480872","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340920#t25340920","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340920#t25340920","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340920#t25340920","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cory_of_nefer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cory-of-nefer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25340920,"talkid":98987,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508920.html?thread=25340920#t25340920","upictitle":"Cory Stewart: pic#125222114","article":"With so many books, do you recommend reading them in sequential order?
