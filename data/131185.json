{"itemid":512,"subject":"R.I.P. Kage Baker","event":"Kage Baker has passed away this morning, from cancer.\r\n\r\nI was saddened to hear the news.  I did not know Kage well, but I had the chance to meet her a couple of years ago, when the two of us were Guests of Honor together at a small con in Madison, Wisconsin, and she was great company.  Lively, intelligent, good-humored, full of life.\r\n\r\nShe was also a damn fine writer.  She contributed a Cugel the Clever story, \"The Green Bird,\" to SONGS OF THE DYING EARTH, the Jack Vance tribute anthology I co-edited with Gardner Dozois, and captured Cugel perfectly, no mean feat.  I would have loved to have had the chance to buy more stories from her for future anthologies.  \r\n\r\nCheck out her books, if you're not familiar with them.  Flowers and donations and tributes are all well and good, but I've always felt that the best way to remember any writer is to read their work.  Kage's work deserves to be read and reread for many years to come.  It's sad to think there won't be any more of it.\r\n\r\nGoodbye, Kage.

I learned a lot from that experience, about myself and about life. Specifically, I learned that I cannot continue to put off goals that I have held since high school (ten years ago). So, I am now working on my own fantasy series, one set in Medieval Europe with a high-fantasy feel.<br />Whereas my Dad's death inspired me to get my butt in gear, your writing has inspired me to write a fantasy series that goes beyond the \"sword and sorcery\" which is so often attached to fantasy in general. Although you write in a different genre, I think of you as the Isaac Asimov of Fantasy. <br />Asimov drew readers in with his attentiveness to human nature and its relationship with technology. Asimov did not need an endless series of action sequences to keep readers focussed. The same can be said of your series, I believe. I thoroughly enjoy how your characters are not wholly good or evil. Instead, they are simply human, which makes them more endearing and real.<br />Just as Asimov used science fiction as a commentary on the relationship between humanity and technology, I believe your Song of Ice and Fire series is a commentary on humanity's relationship with power.<br />While studying for my masters degree in military histoy years ago, I came to realize that human nature has changed very little. We will always have moral martyrs like Eddard, innocents like Sansa (an innocence soon lost I dare to presume?), beasts like Gregor (I cannot name Sandor, for I believe that he was more knightly than many other knights in your books and in history), social outcasts like Brienne and Tyrion, and many more.<br />I've read few works of fiction that make me empathize with the characters in question the way I empathize with humanity when reading historical non-fiction, so thank you for creating a fantasy series filled with detailed and flawed characters that grow before our eyes.<br />I eagerly await A Dance of Dragons. I know you must get many emails full of anger for having to wait so long for the completion of Dragons, but I have no problem waiting even ten years to read the gem that Dragons is likely to be, and I am sure many others feel the same.<br />Good luck!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"February 9 2010, 21:19:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Cancer","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://medievaleurope.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"medievaleurope","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"medievaleurope","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://medievaleurope.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"medievaleurope","ctime_ts":1265750361,"tracked":0}]}
