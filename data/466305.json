{"itemid":1821,"subject":"Say It Ain't So, Coach","event":"Tom Coughlin announced today that he is stepping down as head coach of the New York Giants.\r\n\r\nThat makes me very sad.\r\n\r\nCoughlin has been coaching the G-Men for twelve seasons, the longest tenure since Steve Owens back in the jurassic age of professional football.  He's compiled a winning record, and has led Big Blue to two Superbowls, winning them both.  He helped shape Eli Manning into one of the best QBs in the NFL.\r\n\r\nYes, the Giants have missed the playoffs for four years.  And this year was dreadful.  \r\n\r\nBut I put most of the blame for that on the Giants front office, not Coughlin.  The team had terrible luck with injuries this year -- I believe the Giants ended the season with more players on IR than any other team -- but even aside from that, the talent just wasn't there.  Look at the Minnesota game.  With Odell Beckham Junior suspended, it became blindingly obvious that the Giants had no other receivers who could actually catch Eli's passes.  And the defense... oh, don't get me started on the defense.  Worst in the NFL?!?\r\n\r\nCoughlin's fault?  No.  Truth be told, no coach could have won with the roster he had this year.  Not Evil Little Bill.  Not Parcells.  Not Don Shula, not Chuck Noll, not Tom Landry.  Not even the sainted Vince Lombardi.  \r\n\r\nI wish Tom Coughlin well.  He was a great coach and he had a great run, and he should leave with his head held high.\r\n\r\nI have no idea who the G-Men can possibly bring in to replace him.  He's going to be a hard act to follow.","ditemid":466305,"eventtime":"2016-01-04 14:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"melancholy","current_location":"bluesville","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jan  4 21:58:22 2016]R [Mon Jan  4 21:58:23 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/684131789154070528 ","current_moodid":39,"commentalter":1454978887,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/684131789154070528","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"picture_keyword":"sadface","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.739683283900384]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451944781}","revtime":1451944779},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-04 21:58:20","anum":129,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html","event_timestamp":1451919540,"reply_count":71,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125746121/77273269","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?replyto=23792001","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23792001#t23792001","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23792001#t23792001","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23792001#t23792001","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3459252","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Prom000","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23792001,"talkid":92937,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23792001#t23792001","article":"But now he can come join the dark side hear in New England.<br />We take him!

A lot of similarities in how those two operate. Jets can only be so lucky if Bowles is like Coughlin, but it's possible. In my opinion, Todd Bowles is a great coach and a great hire by the Jets.<br /><br />But today, the focus is on Coughlin. I like the Pats a lot more than you do George (they're a distant second, though still second, to my moribund Lions), but I still respect how he led the Giants to two titles over NE juggernauts.

However, that number is misleading for the Pats because Edelman, Gronk, Amandola, Hightower, and Jamie Collins all missed multiple weeks or are week to week with legit injuries. Of course I am bias because I am a Partiots fan, and for the most part the team \"next man up\" philosophy worked allowing them to remain competitive the second half of the season. Though I'm still optimistic if those core player can get healthy that the Pat compete this post-season.<br /><br /><br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 7 2016, 02:37:58 UTC","parent":23797121,"massactions":0,"subject":"RE: Number of players on IR","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/patrick.st.croix.1","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Patrick St.Croix","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2748214","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72125148&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Patrick St.Croix","ctime_ts":1452134278,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125746212/77273408","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?replyto=23797633","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797633#t23797633","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797633#t23797633","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797633#t23797633","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3459293","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10100378448019132/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23797633,"talkid":92959,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797633#t23797633","upictitle":"Christopher Feeney: pic#125746212","article":"I think Mara will go with Sean McDermott-- defense-minded, highly-sought, and professional.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 4 2016, 22:39:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10100378448019132/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Christopher Feeney","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3459293","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77273408&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Christopher Feeney","ctime_ts":1451947194,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123903486/72071300","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?replyto=23797889","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797889#t23797889","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797889#t23797889","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797889#t23797889","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2738803","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/OberynMattell","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23797889,"talkid":92960,"etime_ts":"1451947676","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/466305.html?thread=23797889#t23797889","upictitle":"Oberyn Mattell: pic#123903486","article":"None of the Giants players liked Coughlin either at first, but that turned out well.

I guess we're seeing a pattern here that great coaches are usually no nonsense guys who have a specific vision and aren't afraid to get rid of anyone who isn't on board with it.

I'll never forget the 2007 Super Bowl, which still remains far-and-away the best, most magical game I've ever watched. I was a Giants fan that day, and I have no regrets.
