{"itemid":577,"subject":"Off-Season Football","event":"The Jets made another huge splash in the NFL offseason yesterday, trading for the talented but troubled Pittsburgs Steeler wide receiver Santonio Holmes.  Holmes comes to New York complete with a four-game suspension for violation of the league's substance abuse policy, so the Jets don't actually get him on the field until game five.  He's also in trouble for an incident down in Florida where he is accused of throwing a glass of juice in a woman's face.  If that one goes badly for him, it could well result in an additional suspension.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Jets get Holmes incredibly cheaply.  The Steelers will receive a fifth-round draft choice in this year's draft, a bag of old footballs, and some used jockstraps.  And when Holmes is actually on the field, he's a damned good receiver.  Witness the sensational catch he made in the waning seconds of the SuperBowl two years ago, which won the Steelers the world championship.\r\n\r\nI really have mixed feelings about this trade.  The Jets did need a major infusion of talent at the wide receiver position, no doubt of it.  Mark Sanchez needs someone to throw to, if he is to avoid the traditional sophomore slump, and Gang Green's league-leading rush attack can only benefit if they can improve their passing offense.\r\n\r\nThey did pick up Braylon \"Ooops\" Edwards last year in a trade, but so far he has not shown he is the answer.  There have been persistent rumors of the Jets trading for Brandon Marshall of the Broncos, and even talk of them signing Plaxico Burress once he gets out of prison.  Acquiring Holmes makes all that moot. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am not crazy about the Jets being the new Oakland Raiders and filling up the roster with troublemakers and low-character castoffs from other teams.\r\n\r\nThis trade is going to impact the Jets long before Santonio actually takes the field in green and white.  A whole bunch of mock drafts had Gang Green selecting Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate in the first round when the NFL assembles in NYC at the end of the month for their annual game of high stakes Pick'em.  That's looking a lot less likely this morning.  Bad news for Tate, probably... but it does free the Jets to fill another area of need, now that we are set at wideout (kinda sorta).\r\n\r\nShould be an interesting year.","ditemid":147712,"eventtime":"2010-04-12 13:47:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"jets 1","personifi_word_count":416,"taglist":"nfl","opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1271785350,"personifi_tags":"17:18,18:9,35:5,33:3,10:5,37:11,16:18,3:9,25:5,39:3,20:9,47:3,22:5,13:30","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-04-12 19:47:07","anum":0,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html","event_timestamp":1271080020,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93375406/13788129","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?replyto=9675776","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9675776#t9675776","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9675776#t9675776","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9675776#t9675776","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trebla1972","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trebla1972.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9675776,"talkid":37796,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9675776#t9675776","upictitle":"trebla1972: pic#93375406","article":"Supposedly the Jets were the only team interested but I highly doubt that.

They've always taken amazing players which are considered safe picks - but the league is quarterback-driven and this is why teams such as the Colts, the Saints, the Patriots etc. do well whilst teams such as Buffalo, Cleveland, and St. Louis continually draft in the top 10. Also, don't be overawed at Suh's playing ability. Firstly, it's not certain that he'll do well in the actual NFL (NFL offensive linemen are some of the nastiest sons of bitches around). Secondly, he has a history of injuries which could worsen as he enters the league. Finally, DTs bust more often than QBs when it comes to first-round draft picks.<br /><br />I think the Rams should take Bradford, the Lions should take Okung, the Buccaneers should take Suh, and the Redskins should take either Trent Williams or Bryan Bulaga (Bulaga is the better player, but Williams fits better in Shanahan's scheme). <br /><br />As for the Holmes trade, not only does it fill the Jet's <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%232\">#2</a> need (apart from creating more of a pass rush) but it also came dirt cheap. Even if his problems manifest into larger ones and he ends up not being on the field, all the Jets lost were a 5th round pick (which probably would have been blown on a bust OG anyways). If the Jets are truly concerned about Holmes being on the field, they can always pick up a late-round WR like Blair White or Jordan Shipley as insurance.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 13 2010, 00:28:35 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"what?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nukerxform.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nukerxform","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nukerxform","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nukerxform.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nukerxform","ctime_ts":1271118515,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?replyto=9688832","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9688832#t9688832","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9688832#t9688832","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9688832#t9688832","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"w2kb","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://w2kb.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9688832,"talkid":37847,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147712.html?thread=9688832#t9688832","upictitle":"Ken Brown: pic#0","article":"Ha!

I know that Holmes is suspended the first four games, but he had 1250 yards last year. The Jets got him for a 5th round pick? That is a pretty stupid trade by the Steelers. I know they lose people, but you are sending him to an in conference rival for garbage. <br /><br />The Giants really need a middle linebacker since they cut the only good one they had on the team.
