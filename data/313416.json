{"itemid":1224,"subject":"Wild Cards To Brazil","event":"My fantasy novels have been doing very well in Brazil, thanks in no small part to my wonderful publisher LeYa and some gorgeous Marc Simonetti covers... and now my Brazilian readers will have the chance to sample my other long-running series as well.  WILD CARDS is coming to Brazil.\r\n\r\nI am thrilled to announce that I've just signed a deal with LeYa for Brazilian (Portugese) editions of the entire Wild Cards series, all twenty-two volumes, from the original WILD CARDS to the still-in-progress LOWBALL.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/159764/159764_300.jpg\" alt=\"Crop\" title=\"Crop\" width=\"255\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\nI couldn't be happier, and my Wild Cards compatriots and contributors are doing cartwheels.  I hope my Brazilian fans will enjoy reading about Jetboy, the Turtle, Dr. Tachyon, Bugsy, Yeoman, Curveball, Golden Boy, Capn Trips, Rustbelt, IBT, the Sleeper, Oddity, and the rest of the Wild Cards gang as much as we've enjoyed writing about 'em.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/160117/160117_300.jpg\" alt=\"HEARTScolor2\" title=\"HEARTScolor2\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" />\r\n\r\n(And yes, I know, one of these days I must go down and visit Brazil.  I'd love to, really.  Just a matter of finding the time.

However, I would like to point out that LeYa does not perform (in my opinion) a good job translating the Song of Ice and Fire series. I am aware that the translation of many of the cities' names and some expressions is not an easy task. Still, me and many friends of mine have lots of critcs regarding the publisher's choices. I hope that in the future your work will be more thoroughly translated to brazilian readers. As it is now, it seems that they took a translation made for Portugal and just made the changes needed to adjust to our norms and expressions, but in the process many terms and names remained somewhat strange. I am not trying to dismiss completely the value of the effort made by LeYa, but this is something that has been bothering me (and not just me, I am certain that the publishers themselves know about this insatisfaction) for some time, and I think this is a nice opportunity to express myself. I agree with you about the covers, they are stunning here in Brazil.<br /><br />I hope that you find time to come to our country, and if you come during carnival, don't just see what goes on in Rio. The best carnival of the world happens here, but it is in the cities called Recife and Olinda in the state of Pernambuco.<br /><br />My best wishes to you and all those involved in delivering your stories to us.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"February 24 2013, 01:03:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"translation","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000228907154","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Vtor Joanni","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1667503","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=60702970&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Vtor Joanni","ctime_ts":1361667828,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115966352/46455351","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17322312#t17322312","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17322312#t17322312","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17322312#t17322312","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1047548","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/octarinareboot","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17322312,"talkid":67665,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17322312#t17322312","above":17291080,"upictitle":"Lady Octarina: pic#115966352","article":"I agree with you.

Assim, o livro inteiro não seria estragado, com uma expressão que inexiste nos outros livros, e que me incomodou durante toda a leitura.<br /><br />Espero sinceramente que nos títulos seguintes, a tradução seja feita de forma mais profissional.<br /><br /><br />----<br /><br />The Answer:<br /><br />Thiago,<br />Tudo bem?<br />Muito obrigado pela sua ajuda. Vamos bater esses erros e arrumá-los para uma próxima reimpressão. Pode ficar tranquilo que já estamos com um cuidado redobrado em todos os livros.<br />Abs,","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"February 28 2013, 19:12:23 UTC","parent":17295944,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: The translation works well","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/thiagohenrik","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Thiago Henrik","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1675959","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=61108868&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Thiago Henrik","ctime_ts":1362078743,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120214629/60729254","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294664#t17294664","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294664#t17294664","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294664#t17294664","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1667682","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/gus.sinclair.5","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17294664,"talkid":67557,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294664#t17294664","upictitle":"Gus Sinclair: pic#120214629","article":"Yeah we are waiting u here in Brazil.<br /><br />Im sure u will enjoy carnival, but stay some days longer after the party (or arrive earlier), so we can meet U and enjoy our carival as well","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"February 24 2013, 06:13:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/gus.sinclair.5","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gus Sinclair","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1667682","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=60729254&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Gus Sinclair","ctime_ts":1361686426,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294920#t17294920","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294920#t17294920","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294920#t17294920","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1667741","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/117828360676864561213","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17294920,"talkid":67558,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/313416.html?thread=17294920#t17294920","upictitle":"ext_1667741: pic#0","article":"Jorge Candeias (the portuguese translator) do a wonderful job, and Marc Simonetti is amazing, but LeYa...
