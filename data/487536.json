As it happens, I was a contributing writer at SuperversiveSF (currently a Hugo finalist for best fanzine) during 2015. My posts at SSF were critical of last year’s Puppy campaign methods, which made SSF’s nomination this year--after being slated by the RPs--disconcerting.  <br /><br />I am unsure if the award is meant for just the editor, or the group as a whole, but I raised the idea within the group that the nomination should be declined. I know you were for finalists staying put but I had agreed with Black Gate’s decision in general and felt SSF had added reasons to decline in specific.  <br /><br />Short story, I lost.  If interested, I have a post explaining the positions/arguments made within the group for keeping the nomination--and mine for declining--as well as how and why this led to my leaving SSF.  (http://superversivesf.com/2016/05/12/ho<wbr />w-you-play-the-game/)<br /><br />Not sure if any of this would allow me through the door at a Hugo losers party, but at this point I do feel like an award winning loser :)  <br /><br />Seriously though... I was pretty happy that a story of mine made a recommended reading list.  Good enough.<br /><br />On Chicago, I was surprised to read--at your other site--that you used to lived near where I used to live. I had an apartment a few blocks away on Ainslie, closer to the L stop.  Only this was in the late 90s.  I was wondering if it was a rough/poor neighborhood back when you were living there, or if it slid a bit after you left? Of course it was very cheap!","upictitle":"kieran sterling: pic#0","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"12 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"May 15 2016, 09:39:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Wins, Losses, and Chicago","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/106377590928456752043","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kieran sterling","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3113136","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=75295224&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"kieran sterling","ctime_ts":1463305189,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487536.html?thread=24478832#t24478832","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487536.html?thread=24478832#t24478832","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487536.html?thread=24478832#t24478832","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24478832,"talkid":95620,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487536.html?thread=24478832#t24478832","above":24477552,"upictitle":"George R.R.
