Anyway, as a recent reader, my query must have been debated before, but is, Val, now age 30, the stolen by wildlings 'true-born' baby of Lord Stark's bannerman Lord Umber (the Great John)? I know Dalla is said to be Val's sister but they do not look alike and Val would be too young to remember. Wildling families are more encompassing than kneelers' families too. Developing that train of thought due to the recent male Umber cull, could Val be the rightful heir to the Umber lands? Probably totally wrong and Val is a Manderley or someone else entirely! (Gods be good, I hope it's Val who finally does for that bastard Bolton's son in as painful and as extended a Westeros death possible (by say poaching his skin off over a medium heat after she and Jon, now 'warg'ed' into Ghost)  hunt him and his cronies down), in revenge for all the poor girls he has hunted, tortured and killed.
