More importantly, the amount of hype this show is generating is off the charts (you know it's big if South Park devotes 3 episodes to parody it).  If HBO were to release their streaming service as a stand-alone product, millions would sign up just for Game Of Thrones alone.  Release the service today, plenty of time for new viewers to catch up, and the season 4 premier would shatter whatever numbers Netflix is getting for House of Cards, etc, as the most streamed small screen program ever.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, HBO has yet to realize that traditional television programming, especially the paid kind, will inevitably join the ranks of VCRs, beepers, and cassette tapes.  So instead of capitalizing on the perfect opportunity for a market-moving entry to streamed content now, while the industry is still young and wide open, they will instead have to play catch-up years from now, after Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have already established a substantial oligopoly.<br /><br />Instead of being the most streamed television show ever, the season 4 premier will once again likely be the most pirated show ever.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"January 12 2014, 23:53:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"HBO Go","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jakelenihan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jakelenihan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jakelenihan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jakelenihan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jakelenihan","ctime_ts":1389570808,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/352691.html?thread=18591155#t18591155","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/352691.html?thread=18591155#t18591155","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/352691.html?thread=18591155#t18591155","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18591155,"talkid":72621,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/352691.html?thread=18591155#t18591155","above":18590643,"upictitle":"George R.R.
