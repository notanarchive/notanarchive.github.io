{"itemid":1149,"subject":"Domination","event":"Life is magical and filled with joy.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK JETS          35  \r\nINDIANAPOLIS COLTS      9\r\n\r\nNEW YORK GIANTS        26   \r\nSAN FRANCISCO 49ERS     3\r\n\r\nThe Jets game was even more one-sided than the final score would indicate.  Indy's rookie phenom Andrew Luck looked every inch a rookie this morning, and not the least bit lucky.  Gang Green should actually have posted two more TDs, but two terrific pick sixs by Antonio Cromartie were called back by bogus penalty calls.  (It is almost enough to make one want the replacement refs back.  Almost).  Mark Sanchez only passed for 82 yards, but that was more than enough, since Shonn Greene was rushing for 161 and the New York D was playing lights out.  Ground and pound offense and stifling D... that was the formula that got the Jets to two successive AFC championship games.  Nice to see it back again.  Impressive as Greene's running was, the real hero of this game was Cromartie, who has really stepped up his game since Darrell Revis went down for the season.  Gang Green STILL has a shutdown corner, it would seem.  I was also thrilled to hear the announcers mention the name \"Quinton Coples\" several times.  Maybe the Jets first round draft choice is not the second coming of Vernon Gholston after all.\r\n\r\nThe Giants started pretty slowly out in the City By The Bay, sandwiching in a sad little three-and-out between two long Niners drives in the first quarter.  But the defense stiffened towards the end of both those drives, so all that San Francisco had to show for them was one field goal.  And then Eli and the O woke up, and the rest of the game was Big Blue all the way.  The Giants D line harassed Alex Smith relentlessly, sacking him six times and intercepting him thrice.  Two of those INTs were by safety Antrell Rolle, the game's defensive standout.  And for the second week in a row, New York's running game was fearsome.  All the commentators and analysts agreed, no one could run on San Francisco, but Ahmed Bradshaw punched holes through their line time and time again, becoming the first back to run for 100 yards against them in their last upmty-ump (23, I think it might have been) games and scoring the first running TD against them all season.  And Giants rookie David Wilson gashed them for several big runs as well.  As for the Niners O, the Giant D made QB Alex Smith look like the Alex Smith of two years ago, not this year's Alex Smith.  All told, a very impressive, dominating win that left the G-Men atop the NFC East.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just to put some nice fat cherries atop my Sunday sundae, the Cowboys, the Patriots, and the Eagles all lost horribly in the final seconds of their own respective contests.  Oh, yes yes yes, the gods are good, the sun is shining over New York City, and all the pretty girls are blowing me kisses...","ditemid":294219,"eventtime":"2012-10-14 18:46:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1350535142,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1350882450},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-10-15 00:46:08","anum":75,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html","event_timestamp":1350240360,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124483323/36582828","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16718667#t16718667","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16718667#t16718667","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16718667#t16718667","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"insurrbution","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16718667,"talkid":65307,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16718667#t16718667","upictitle":"insurrbution: pic#124483323","article":"It was indeed a great weekend for football.

Sorry, had to. Luck played poorly even beyond what Jets defense caused.<br /><br />That gangrenous team needs an almost total overhaul. Yes, I'm hoping to eat my words.<br /><br />I don't know what came over the Giants D-line. Alex Smith played like his old self. And the D-line played like theirs. Except for Tuck. I saw his jersey and that ridiculous helmet so I know that he was in the game. The Niners, disjointed offensive scheme was awful. For once, Fewell's defensive scheme looked innovative. The combination worked this week.<br /><br />The offensive line seems to be clicking again. Eli has been escaping serious harassment for most of the season and ever since Andre Brown was put in for an injured Bradshaw they have been mostly solid in run blocking. I think Bradshaw picked up on what Brown was doing in waiting for the blocks before exploding. I still remember reading your post on how terrific you thought he'd be from watching his rookie preseason performances. (Did I say that before?) Great call George. You were the first. I don't recall any of the NY sports writers, radio hosts or fans on WFAN calling for him to play before your comment. He's always been the toughest sonofagun and now he's running smarter. <br /><br />David Wilson has been a joy to watch. They need to get him on a post corner route. The kid has great hands despite the one critical drop that he had. With his speed he'd shred any defense.<br /><br />Even a decade ago, would you have ever dreamt in you wildest dreams that the Giants would have a gaggle of receivers with this quality?<br /><br />As happy as I was watching the final 7 minutes of the game, I was brought back to earth upon seeing RG3's highlights. Yes, I'm scared. 3 of 3 losses in the Division? Going back to John Elway I've always been most nervous watching the Giants play mobile QBs.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"October 15 2012, 14:23:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1350311021,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/118840063/52545973","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16722251#t16722251","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16722251#t16722251","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16722251#t16722251","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1407401","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/hunter.baldwin.5","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16722251,"talkid":65321,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/294219.html?thread=16722251#t16722251","upictitle":"Hunter Baldwin: pic#118840063","article":"Yes!!! maybe if your teams keep winning you will not kill everyone off:) Good thing your not a Saints fan like me.

It is different from Quarterback Rating. It takes situations into account and appears to be more detailed. Eli is 3rd and I think near the top the past several years. Higher than other quarterbacks with higher quarterback ratings. You might want to check out ProFootballFocus website. They rate players based on every play. NFL teams use them. Very interesting analysis. <br /><br />Redskins are tough. This game will have to be a shoot out. The giants don't do too well against Mobile Quarterbacks and RG3  looks like Michael Vick in his prime with accuracy and much better coaching. <br /><br />As a Jets fan, I'm kind of rooting for them to lose to get a better draft pick. Squeaking out an 8-8 season means we get a middle of the first round pick and Tannenbaum may keep his job. I think Rex Ryan is a good coach, but Tannenbaum needs to go.
