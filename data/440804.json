Believe it or not, I have been waiting for one of these.<br /><br />First, I do love some Trompe l'oeil. It is one of the things that got me interested in art when I was younger. I love the ones painted on streets or sidewalks like this...<br /><br /><img src=\"http://main-designyoutrust.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/trompe-loeil-reebok-3D-max-and-joe-guinness-book-record-illusion-painting-1-600x419.jpg\"><br /><br /><br /><br />Now, to the question I've been dying to ask...<br /><br />I'm a painter myself. Most of my works are figurative, open ended narratives. I think I do fairly well in the gallery scene with my paintings, but as a long time fan of fantasy and science fiction I've always wanted to try my hand at painting a scene or two from an author's work.<br /><br />Fantasy and SciFi art were the first things I started really getting into drawing when I was a kid. I bought D&D sets just so I could look through the artwork and I'd stare at Boris Vallejo's Conan ladies for days.<br /><br />My question is, how does an artist start off getting together with an author to depict a scene? When you weren't a rock star of the fiction world, what would the best way to get in touch with you about trying to paint something have been? Are things handled differently now that ASoIaF is so popular? Do other author's have different ways of handling this or is it all pretty much the same? Can I just send you an awesome painting to enjoy? Haha.<br /><br />By the way, I absolutely love that one of the things you insisted on for the World book was that it be rich with artwork. As an ASoIaF fan, I would have bought it regardless, but can I just say that the artwork makes me absolutely love it.
