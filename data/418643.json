{"itemid":1635,"subject":"What Now?","event":"For all of you who are sick of Puppygate... I am too, but there's still a few more things that I need to say.  Another day, maybe, and I will move on to happier topics.\r\n\r\nYes, I know about Larry Correia's response to my earlier posts and I will reply to him here... but not just now.  There's another topic I need to cover first, one that I have been leading up to all along -- what the hell do we do now?\r\n\r\nWhether you think what the Sad Puppies did is right or wrong, it's done.  The ballot is out. It is what it is.  So the ball is in our court now.  What to do?\r\n\r\n(Here is where I will probably piss off everybody on the anti-slate of this mess.  Sorry).\r\n\r\nOver at Making Light, and on several other sites, various rules changes are being proposed to prevent this from happening ever again.  There are so many different proposals they make my head spin.  More nominating slots, less nominating slots, weighted voting, eliminating the supporting memberships, outlawing slates, limiting nominees to a single nomination, juried nominations... on and on and on.  The worldcon business meeting is never exactly a funfest, but if the proponents of half these proposals show up at Sasquan, this year's will be a nightmare.  And will probably still be going on when MidAmericon II convenes.  \r\n\r\nI am against all these proposals.  If indeed I am at Spokane, and if I can get myself up in time for the business meeting, I will vote against every one of them.\r\n\r\nMost of them, frankly, suck.  And the mere fact that so many people are discussing them makes me think that the Puppies won.  They started this whole thing by saying the Hugo Awards were rigged to exclude them.  That is completely untrue, as I believe I demonstrated conclusively in my last post.  So what is happening now?  The people on MY SIDE, the trufans and SMOFs and good guys, are having an endless circle jerk trying to come up with a foolproof way to RIG THE HUGOS AND EXCLUDE THEM.  God DAMN, people.  You are proving them right.\r\n\r\nI hate what the Puppies did.   It was based on false premises, and though it was not illegal, it was mean-spirited and unsportsmanlike.  So how about we do NOT prove them right by rigging the rules against Sad Puppies 4?  How about we try to be better than that?  There is nothing wrong with the Hugo rules.  If we want to defeat the Puppies, all we need to do is outvote them.  Get in our own nominations.  This year, the Puppies emptied the kennels and got out their vote, and we didn't. Fandom danced the usual, \"oh, too busy to nominate, I will just vote on the final ballot,\" and for that complacency, we got blindsided.  We lost.  They kicked our fannish asses, and now we have the ballot they gave us.  If we don't want that to happen again, we need to get out our OWN vote.  \r\n\r\nBut let's not give in to our worst impulses.  I do not want to disenfranchise anyone.  (Well, okay, maybe a few, rabies is dangerous).  The fandom I joined in 1971, the fandom I love, is open and friendly and welcoming, and has room for every shade of political opinion and literary taste.  Those are values worth defending, a culture worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nOh, and there's another (lesser, admittedly) reason not to change the Hugo rules.  The Nebulas.  I have been a SFWA member since 1972, and I swear, the organization spends half its time arguing about the Nebula rules, year after year, decade after decade.  I have seen a dozen \"reforms\" in my tenure, all in the interests of making the voting \"more fair,\" but no matter what rules we adopt, a couple years later the bitching starts and members start demanding we change them again.  It's endless.  We do NOT want to open that Pandora's Box at worldcon.  Change the rules to deal with the Sad Puppies, and a year or two from now we'll be changing again.  Aside from adding the occasional category, or splitting one, the Hugo Awards have operated more or less the same way for decades, and that stability is part of their prestige.  Let's not mess with that.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to another proposed countermeasure: the No Award strategy.\r\n\r\nThis comes in two flavors.  The hardliners propose we vote NO AWARD for everything.  Every category, even the ones where the Puppies have no nominees.  No Hugo Awards at Sasquan, whatsoever.  We'll show them.  Rather than letting them move into our house, we will burn it to the ground.  \"We had to destroy the village in order to save it.\"  It worked so well in Vietnam.\r\nAll I've got to say about this idea is, <i><b>are you fucking crazy?</b></i>\r\n\r\nThe other approach is less radical.  Vote NO AWARD in all the categories that are All Puppy.  In the others, chose between the nominees (there are a few) that did not appear on either the Sad Puppy or Rabid Puppy slate, and place all the rest, the SP/RP candidates, under No Award.\r\n\r\nThat's less insane than the \"No Award For Everything\" idea, but only a little bit.  Sorry, I will not sign on for this one either.  For a whole bunch of reasons.  For starts, the Puppies are already proclaiming that \"No Award\" equals victory for them (though sometimes it seems as though they believe anything that happens constitutes victory for them).  Also, near as I can tell from reading the blogs, it appears that some of the Sad Puppy candidates never consented to joining their slate, and that <i>none</i> of the Rabid Puppies were ever asked if they wanted to be included (I am ninety per cent certain that none of the films or TV shows in the two Dramatic Presentations category were ever contacted).  There are also a whole bunch of people -- all the editors except Vox Day, for starts -- who may or may not have been contacted.  No one has said, no one talking about it, we just don't know.\r\n\r\nAlso... really, when you come down to it, this whole \"were they contacted?\" thing is a false issue.  Torgensen says he contacted almost everyone, but missed a few.  Some of his slate say no, they never heard from him... but does it really matter?  I have been trying my damndest to get Alan Lee and John Howe nominated for Best Artist for years, and I never asked if I could.  This year I wrote a long post about the brilliance of STATION ELEVEN and why it should be nominated in Best Novel, and I never contacted Emily St. John Mandel to ask if I could.  I will not condemn Brad Torgensen for failing to do what I never do myself.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in Guilt by Association, and that's what we'd be doing if we vote against every name on the Puppy slates simply because they are on the slate.  That was a classic weapon of the McCarthy Era: first you blacklist the communists, then you blacklist the people who defend the communists and the companies that hire them, then you blacklist the people who defend the people on the blacklist, and on and on, in ever widening circles.  No.  I won't be part of that.\r\n\r\nI have looked over the ballot, but I have not read all of it.  Will I read all of it?  Well, not every word.... but I will at least glance at every nomination.  I know, from past experience, that there are some very talented writers on the list.  There are also some very bad writers, and at least one whose picture probably appears next to MEDIOCRE in Websters.  There are a lot of writers I have never read before, whose work I need to sample.  Torgensen has claimed that the Sad Puppies slate is diverse, and a cursory glance at the names suggests he is not wrong.  \r\n\r\nI intend to consider every story and every finalist in every category, and vote for those that I think worthy of Hugos.  I will vote NO AWARD, I promise you, but only where No Award is warranted.  (Truth be told, I vote No Award every year in almost every category.  Usually not in first, admittedly... but I don't just look at a category and rank them one to five in order of preference, I rank the ones I think rocket-worthy above No Award, and the ones I don't below).\r\n\r\nThis ballot is the worst I have ever seen, admittedly, and there are stories and writers on it who are not fit to polish a Hugo, much less win one.  But there's good stuff as well, and talented writers whose work I have enjoyed, and I am not going to vote against them just because the Sad Puppies like them too.\r\n\r\nAs I get further into my reading, I will let you know my thoughts on what I've read.  But that may be a long process, so be patient.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I don't think any of the choices we have now are good ones.  All roads seem to lead to perdition, but each of us will need to walk the one we think best.  Meanwhile, I urge everyone who is reading this to go to the Sasquan website and join the convention.  Attend if you can; if not, join as a Supporting member, just as the Puppies did.  It is too late to nominate, but not too late to vote.  The Puppies will be getting out their vote, you can be sure.  We need to do the same, unless we care to see some poor guy hand Vox Day a rocket.\r\n\r\nI wish I was more optimistic about how all this is going to turn out.\r\n\r\n                      Turning and turning in the widening gyre\r\n                      The falcon cannot hear the falconer;\r\n                      Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\r\n                      Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\r\n                      The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\r\n                      The ceremony of innocence is drowned;\r\n                      The best lack all conviction, while the worst\r\n                      Are full of passionate intensity.\r\n\r\n(That's Yeats, not me.  Just to be clear).","ditemid":418643,"eventtime":"2015-04-09 23:17:00","props":{"current_mood":"depressed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":9,"commentalter":1431713924,"crosspost_tw":" What Now? http://j.mp/1atC55n","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sadface","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.657506913343636]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428684875}","revtime":1431713964},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-10 05:16:12","anum":83,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html","event_timestamp":1428621420,"reply_count":303,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124813715/75139090","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20774227#t20774227","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20774227#t20774227","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20774227#t20774227","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"buttonmutton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://buttonmutton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20774227,"talkid":81149,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20774227#t20774227","article":"You ought to work a band of rowdy knights or outlaws named The Sad Puppies into Son of Kong.

Just concentrate on doing what you can do to make sure that the books and shows and movies that you love are represented. If that means beating them at there own game then so be it but if you start trying to exclude them because they accuse you of being exclusionary then you only prove their point.

I agree completely with GRRM.  The only sensible thing we can do is to simply review the nominees and vote as if Puppy slates never happened.  <br /><br /> This won't be easy to do. I wish there was some way to redact the names involved and wipe my memory of the block slates.  I am not sure that I can even come close to objectivity when it comes to some of the nominations, especially some of the more egregious on the Rabid Puppy slate.  I suspect that no matter how hard I try to be objective I will still be susceptible to bias when it comes to Castalia House.<br /><br /> Another item which causes me concern is one of the more recent responses from Vox Day in a thread at File770 in which he states, \"If No Award takes a fiction category, you will likely never see another award given in that category again. The sword cuts both ways, Lois. We are prepared for all eventualities.\" ( <a href='http://file770.com/?p=21780&cpage=1&hc_location=ufi#comment-250236' rel='nofollow'>http://file770.com/?p=21780&cpage=1&hc_location=ufi#comment-250236</a> )<br /><br /><br /> This is disturbing and makes it even more difficult to be objective when considering the nominees.  I will try.<br /><br />  On the issue of future changes to the nomination process, I also agree.  If bullies are trying to change our system, then changing the system is the last thing we should do. Unfortunately, the matter seems to be picking up a full head of steam, especially with Bruce Schneier's thread on voting systems over at Teresa Nielsen Hayden's Making Light ( <a href='http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/016199.html' rel='nofollow'>http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/ar<wbr />chives/016199.html</a> ).

This has unfortunate consequences, and I feel bad about those, but that's where my personal moral balance lies.<br /><br />I'm not doing this to punish the nominees who were unaware. I do not believe in blanket guilt by association, and it's very clear at this point that there were some people who weren't guilty. I'm doing it to make it clear that including some percentage of unassociated works on a slate doesn't change anything.<br /><br />I am 100% sure that neither Sad or Rabid Puppies will distinguish between a nominee who wholeheartedly agrees with them and a nominee who didn't know what was happening, should any of their candidates win. I don't want to see the victory celebration; it'll be touted as a success story, used as propaganda, and the slate will be more likely to succeed the next time.<br /><br />I also believe that even the non-Puppy candidates are, to some degree, affected. In Best Novel, without the Puppies, we'd have had three other nominations. In 2012, the eventual winner for Best Related Work was 4th on the nomination list -- so it's entirely possible that the Puppies have already squeezed out a work that would have won a Hugo under normal circumstances.<br /><br />This won't keep me from voting for non-Puppy candidates, but it's another piece of truth that makes me think that the Hugos are already broken for this year.

Because there's a lot of sf/fantasy out there, and because of people having different tastes, if lockstep bloc voting for slates that take up most of the ballot aren't  stopped, we may as well entertain the proposal to make 2016 the last Hugos. <br /><br />The Sad Puppies actions this year prove this; remember, before issuing the slate, they solicited recommendations (and if they'd just stopped there....). For Best Novel, they got more than 30 recs...none of which were recommended by more than 5 people. Similarly, it takes just 10% or so of the number of people nominating to get something on the ballot; 15% is (currently) pretty much a sure thing. But if the SPs hadn't issued a slate, their supporters' nominations would've been as scattered as those of the non-Puppy nominators. <br /><br />Also, I'll give the SPs a small benefit of the doubt. But it's clear, based on his statements, that VD and the Rabids (*not* the name of my next rock band) basically want to destroy the Hugos. He's declared he's running a \"Thanatos Gambit\" where he feels he wins if the Hugos are destroyed or if No Award wins, or if his slate wins. And if none of that happens, he claims he's just going to try harder next time.  At this point, ignoring the SPs, we're still up against someone who is fanatical about either remaking the Hugos in his image or destroying them, and unfortunately has the resources to keep trying. Putting up defenses against this is not a bad thing.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 10 2015, 07:03:20 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://querldox.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"querldox","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"querldox","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://querldox.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"querldox","ctime_ts":1428649400,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/63147548/12757243","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20889683#t20889683","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20889683#t20889683","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20889683#t20889683","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"emp_sheeptopia","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://emp-sheeptopia.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20889683,"talkid":81600,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20889683#t20889683","above":20784211,"upictitle":"emp_sheeptopia: Laura Easter 72","article":"<p dir=\"ltr\">I am SO putting a band named VD and the Rabid Puppies in a book.

Peterson: D for Dothraki","article":"This whole thing is awkward and upsetting to me. The only reason I even heard of WorldCon and started attending is because of my tangential relation to your work. I'm still basically an outsider. I haven't heard of anything on this year's Hugo ballot, Sad Puppy or otherwise. I've made a lot of good friends since I started going to WorldCon and other conventions, though—friends who've been a part of either a specific or broad fandom for years. Many are writers—some of them may end up in the 6-15 slots on this year's Hugo ballot. Since I'm going to be at WorldCon, I feel a responsibility to vote, but I'm not even sure what to do about it. I don't have time to read a lot of stuff. I feel like I'll be upsetting someone by either voting for something, voting for no award, or not voting at all, which leaves me wondering what to do. My first WorldCon was 2011 in Reno. My first book came out last year; my next one is coming out this year. It just feels like the whole thing is snakebit—like this was a bad time to find sff. I wish I could ignore all the hubbub, but even <i>that</i> is making a choice.<br /><br />As an outsider, though, I've seen that there's a lot of heartache going around—from well-known authors to little-known authors to fans, from all over every spectrum—and I just want to say that my heart goes out to you. I don't see how any of this gets better before it gets worse. :(","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 10 2015, 07:32:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dothraki.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dothraki","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dothraki","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dothraki.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dothraki","ctime_ts":1428651157,"tracked":0},{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"zanda_myrande","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://zanda-myrande.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20789331,"talkid":81208,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20789331#t20789331","above":20787027,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","parent":20787027,"massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://zanda-myrande.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/userhead/92?v=1320914678","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"zanda_myrande","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"zanda_myrande","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://zanda-myrande.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"zanda_myrande","ctime_ts":1428652833,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124062556/67640770","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20787795#t20787795","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20787795#t20787795","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20787795#t20787795","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20787795#t20787795","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ethangorham","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ethangorham.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20787795,"talkid":81202,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/418643.html?thread=20787795#t20787795","upictitle":"ethangorham: pic#124062556","article":"The only thing Worldcon/Hugos need to do as far as rule/category changes go is to announce a slate of awards called the OGUHs (named for sounding like 'Oh God' and after the great and honorable Bizarro) whose purpose is to recognize the worst or most mediocre in Science Fiction/Fantasy every year.

LA Robson: pic#120060274","article":"Thank you for writing about this.  I feel better having read your response to the situation with its calm, thoughtful reaction, having spent a few days wading through other more volatile places.<br /><br />My initial reaction was that the voting system should be changed to avoid hijack efforts, although on further examination as you say - there are two reasons not to bother changing the format.  First of all it signals that fans can't be trusted to be decent human beings any more, which is completely the opposite message to the one required and second it risks the sanity of hundreds as they try to invent an incorruptible system.  I don't know if anyone proposed a system specifically to exclude certain groups or not; if they did, shame on them.  Fandom was one of those places where it seemed like the Bill of Rights really did operate as intended, at least in my idealistic take on it when I met up with it in the early 1990s.<br /><br />I'm writing here to add my few pence on a note that I hope may give some cause for positive reflection.  This has done a lot to highlight the history and legacy of both the Hugos and fandom, even if that has come about in a depressing and negative way.  That legacy is a noble one, full of good intentions and humane kindnesses, as well as the odd slip up: we're only human, but fans have always been pretty good humans collectively.  We don't always make it but we work hard at it.  This Hugo slate is bringing out the worst even in good people, sadly, but it's also lighting a fire under those of us, like me, who've sat about in comfortable complacency thinking that things were mostly OK.<br /><br />All the qualities you mention as precious within the community of fans are very precious and they are STILL THERE.  I anticipate that in among the flame wars and the panicky, ill-considered defenses there will be sleepers who awake and spend their money to join the Worldcon, this year and all the years after, to let their considered votes expand and strengthen the diversity and validity of the Hugos. Worldcon's membership will grow and its coffers expand somewhat. I did think it was broken, like you, but it ain't over until the fat lady sings.  That lady ain't even on the stage yet.<br /><br />Just bought my membership.

These are the nominees that have been voted according to the rules. Some of them are very fine candidates for the Hugo, and many have nothing to do with the current political polarization. Those of us who do not want the Hugos to be a political war should give them a fair chance, regardless of what we think of the SP campaign.<br /><br />Regarding changes to the voting rules: I really wish you would reconsider. I think you have misunderstood the purpose of the rule changes that are being proposed. They are not rules designed to shut out voters we dislike. They are designed to reduce the power of voting blocs, while still giving them a fair representation.<br /><br />The Sad Puppies are basically a political party in an election where there are no other political parties. They have about 10% of voters but they all vote for the same list, while the rest of voters are dispersed. Under the current system, a 10% voting-block basically gets to determine almost all of the nominees, if the rest of voters are dispersed.<br /><br />Now, this is a relatively large voting bloc. They are a strong voice in fandom, and they deserve to be heard and be given a fair representation of their tastes. But they are not the only ones who deserve to be heard. The other 90% of voters also deserve a chance to see their tastes represented. The current nomination system is completely vulnerable to bloc voting, not only by the Sad Puppies, but also by other special interest groups with common concerns. Actually, the Sad Puppies campaign could be a good thing, because it's so blatant that it has made it plain for everyone how vulnerable the system is. It allows us to set a fairer voting system for the nominations. A system that won't shut out a voting bloc like the Puppies, but that will give them fair representation without sweeping 100% of the nominees. Those systems exist and are being proposed. We should all think about it seriously.<br /><br />Consider the alternatives if we do not change the rules for the nomination vote:<br />a) The rules are not changed but the Sad Puppies and everyone else decide not to employ bloc-voting. Hopefully everyone will keep taking part in the process but in an individual manner. My favorite alternative, but let's be honest, do you see it happening, once it has been shown what a well-organized minority can achieve with a voting bloc?<br />b) The rules are not changed, the Sad Puppies keep up their campaign and no other political parties are organized. In this case the Sad Puppies will sweep the nominations year after year. 90% of voters will feel disenfranchised and eventually give up on the Hugos. The Hugos become irrelevant.<br />c) The rules are not changed, the Sad Puppies keep up their campaign and one or more other political parties are organized. The Hugos become an election between rival political parties. The Hugos become irrelevant.<br /><br />In your first post you wrote that you feared the Hugos had been broken. What has been shown to be broken are not the Hugos, but the voting rules for the nomination. There are extremely good alternatives that will give fair representation to voting blocs while not shutting out everyone else. Please, take the time to learn about them. The Hugos will be richer, more diverse and more open to all the different voices within the fandom.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 10 2015, 09:19:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Please, give the proposed rules changes a fair hearing","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/116392757960126041895","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Alvaro Garces","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2870928","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72972956&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Alvaro Garces","ctime_ts":1428657543,"tracked":0}]}
