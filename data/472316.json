{"itemid":1844,"subject":"What They Edited, Once More","event":"So... as we discussed below, a lot of fans don't know who to nominate for the Hugo in the two editorial categories because they don't know who edited what last year.  The problem is especially acute in Long Form.\r\n\r\nFair enough.  So I went and <b>asked</b> the editors I'd recommended what books they'd edited.  We all benefit by being well informed, no?\r\n\r\nYou'll find the responses from Jane Johnson (Voyager) and Anne Groell (Bantam Spectra) in my post below.  Today I received another answer, from DIANA PHO of Tor.\r\n\r\nDiana worked on a <b>LOT </b> of titles last year, but most of them are not scheduled for release until this year or next.  (And that includes HIGH STAKES, the latest volume in my Wild Cards series).  The only novel on her list to be published in 2015 was LONG BLACK CURL, by Alex Bledsoe.  She was also one of the editors at Tor.com, however, and in that capacity she was the editor on \"The Two Weddings of Bronwyn Hyatt,\" by Alex Bledsoe, from last May.  Three other stories she acquired for Tor.com, from Margaret Killjoy, P. Djeli Clark, and Bledsue) will be out in 2016.  Diana is also responsible for BEYOND VICTORIANA, a website dedicated to multicultural steampunk ('this has been my side project for the past seven years,' she tells me).  You can find it here:  www.beyondvictoriana.com\r\n\r\nShould more editors respond, I will post their credits here as well.\r\n\r\nConsider this a Fannish Service Announcement,","ditemid":472316,"eventtime":"2016-02-13 16:33:00","props":{"current_mood":"cheerful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, awards, editing","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Feb 11 23:32:46 2016]R [Thu Feb 11 23:32:47 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/697926283729108993 ","current_moodid":125,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1455479736,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/697926283729108993","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.639709989859194]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1455233653}","revtime":1456024130},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-02-11 23:32:44","anum":252,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472316.html","event_timestamp":1455381180,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"branika_13","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://branika-13.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23994364,"talkid":93727,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472316.html?thread=23994364#t23994364","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://branika-13.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"branika_13","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"branika_13","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://branika-13.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"branika_13","ctime_ts":1455238579,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123692389/50421741","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472316.html?thread=23994876#t23994876","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472316.html?thread=23994876#t23994876","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472316.html?thread=23994876#t23994876","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dragonborngurl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23994876,"talkid":93729,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/472316.html?thread=23994876#t23994876","upictitle":"L’esprit de l’escalier: pic#123692389","article":"seriously George, Thank you so much for helping us get through the muddy waters!!
