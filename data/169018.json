It was the BBC's involvement in co-funding ROME and then pulling out which triggered the sequence of events that led to the show being cancelled before its time, plus they completely butchered the series, cut and edited badly, and showed it months and months after US transmission. Last year they also didn't do a great job showing THE WIRE, hiding it near midnight on BBC-2.<br /><br />All of that said, the thought of GAME OF THRONES airing on prime-time BBC-1 where it would be exposed to a massive audience was very encouraging.<br /><br />Whilst Sky will undoubtedly treat the show with a lot of respect, show it at a good time and so on, the profile of the series in the UK when it airs will now be a lot lower, due to Sky's much smaller audience. However, the final and best thing this news means is that THRONES should air in the UK almost immediately after the US. Sky are very hot on showing US shows within days of US transmission to beat the downloaders, and in fact simulcast the LOST series finale for UK die-hard fans (at 5am in the morning!). So that is very good news :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 29 2010, 02:58:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"werthead","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"werthead","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"werthead","ctime_ts":1280372302,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/65003658/7076658","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169018.html?replyto=10778682","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169018.html?thread=10778682#t10778682","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169018.html?thread=10778682#t10778682","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169018.html?thread=10778682#t10778682","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169018.html?thread=10778682#t10778682","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"isis_newton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://isis-newton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10778682,"talkid":42104,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/169018.html?thread=10778682#t10778682","above":10770234,"upictitle":"Isis: dropped my ring oops","article":"Wertykins, I've seen you mention before (I think about the election stuff) Sky not having as many viewers as the BBC - while that is undoubtedly true, do you know what the comparative figures are?
