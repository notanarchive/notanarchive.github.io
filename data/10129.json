{"itemid":39,"subject":"Oh, the Humanity!","event":"Well, I spent several hours on the phone yesterday, talking with my local computer guru, my Australian computer guru, and two different service consultants at AOL (from India or Bangladesh would be my guess, judging from their accents).  We tried many different things, some several times, but in the end nothing worked.  My emails and bookmarks are still gone.  It is now starting to look pretty certain that they are lost for good, although there are a few last-ditch things I want to try before I give up completely.\r\n\r\nIn a way this is a sort of liberation, as I said in my last post here... but it still has me bummed out.  Every time I think I have started to put it behind me, I remember another particular bit of email -- incoming, out-going, or waiting to be finished -- that is now lost to me, and I get morose all over again.  It's a rotten way to start the year.\r\n\r\nI am doing a lot of thinking, however.  I have to make some serious changes in the ways I handle email.  As traumatic as this loss has been, it was ridiculous that I ever allowed myself to get into a position where I HAD more than three thousand unanswered emails in my filing cabinet.  Some of them dated as far back as 1998 (the last time AOL treated me to one of these crashes, and wiped out my files).  I kept them because, well... many of them were long, thoughtful, moving emails from my readers than I felt deserved replies, and I kept telling myself that one day I would reply to them, but then...\r\n\r\nThe problem did not occur overnight, of course.  There must have been a time in 1998 when I had only ten unanswered emails.  And that night I answered five of them, and the next day ten new ones came in, and... well, I did my best to keep up, by fits and starts, but I could never quite do it, even when I resorted to half a dozen different form letters, so over the years I just started falling further and further behind.  At one point in 2004, I recall, the number had climbed to over 2500, and I got alarmed and girded up my loins (painful, that) and by hook and by crook got it down under 1600 in less than a month.  Then I went away on a trip, and by the time I came back it was over 2500 again.\r\n\r\nOf course, I shouldn't give the impression that all of the mails I lost were fan letters.  Far from it.  I also had personal correspondence in there, hobby stuff, and lots and lots of business emails.  I need a better way to handle those as well.\r\n\r\nRight now the thing is too fresh and I don't know what I am going to do, but I do feel that I have to make changes.  If nothing else, the psychological pressure of an ever-increasing amount of accumulating email is enormous... even on nights where I answered fifty letters, I would go away feeling guilty because I knew damn well that another month would pass before I found the energy to answer the next fifty, and during that month I'd fall another three or four hundred emails behind.\r\n\r\nThere were times early in my career when it felt as if I was publishing my books only to check them down a well.  Months and years would pass without me getting a single fan letter of any sort.  Maybe it's the memory of those days that has made me so appreciative of all the readers who have taken the time to write me about my books.\r\n\r\nEven so, I can't go on the way that I was going.","ditemid":10129,"eventtime":"2007-01-06 23:09:00","props":{"commentalter":1169011122,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-01-07 07:09:51","anum":145,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html","event_timestamp":1168124940,"reply_count":105,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/6259371/1210180","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?replyto=1149329","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1149329#t1149329","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1149329#t1149329","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1149329#t1149329","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hedwig_snowy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hedwig-snowy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1149329,"talkid":4489,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1149329#t1149329","upictitle":"Hedwig: Hedwig","article":"As for fan mail: Would it work to hire someone to handle that?

While it's still technically in \"beta\", that's the case for a lot of Google's excellent services -- they don't pull them out of \"beta\" before they're more bug-free than the vast majority of software that has gone \"gold\".<br /><br />But we'd  go a step further -- get <a href=\"http://www.google.com/a/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Apps for your Domain</a> so that you can get Gmail for your domain (basically, mail sent to addresses at georgerrmartin.com will go to Gmail servers, and you can respond to them via the Gmail interface with the from remaining <address>@georgerrmartin.com). This is what Linda and I use for our personal site, Hippoiathanatoi.com, and it works very nicely. We may end up moving Westeros.org to it as well, depending on some technical things. It would require some help from your Webmaster to change your domain records so that mail points to Gmail's servers (Gmail has extensive help files explaining this process, and Linda and I would be glad to help, having had prior experience).<br /><br />With it, you can set up multiple e-mails for different purposes -- business, business proposals, friends, general contact, and so on -- and create various filters, labels (basically folders), and so on to help organize and prioritize your mail. You get excellent spam handling, too -- 99.999% of spam doesn't get through their spam filters.  And because it has a web interface (although if you prefer Pop3 and downloading it directly to your own computer, you can do that, too), if you decide to move from personally answering all e-mail to having someone help you sort through it, they can access it pretty easily on-line and do that for you.<br /><br />You might also drop the general contact address entirely, and find some other means by which fans can contact you. Robert Jordan uses his official blog, and you could similarly just use LJ to, say, solicit questions once per month and then post a response to a selected few as a separate post. Stephen R. Donaldson's <a href=\"http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">gradual interview</a> is a very interesting approach, basically doing something like our So Spake Martin collection but in an official way, which means more published responses that hopefully help to curtail redundant questions. Wouldn't be that hard to implement something like that at Westeros, using our content management system, and fold it seamlessly into the SSM Collection...<br /><br />Regardless, whatever you do, you should set up some sort of Contact page on your website -- either to list several public addresses for various kinds of queries, or to just be your one address -- which provides pointers to various resources (yes, the Ice and Fire board, the Concordance, the So Spake Martin collection, and so on) fans with questions might consider going to to get answers to their questions before they hazard mailing you.</address>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"January 7 2007, 11:43:23 UTC","parent":1150097,"massactions":0,"subject":"Gmail for your

However, not everyone gets on with this and you may well be more comfortable staying with a different way of accessing your email.  Also ANY email service is prone to lose messages (or have you accidentally delete them) once in a while.<br /><br />What I suggest is this.  Get a gmail account and set up your main email so that every email you get AND every email you send is automatically forwarded to your gmail account as well.  Then you don't *use* your gmail but it is there as an emergency backup in case the worst happens or in case you want to find an email you've deleted but which has become relevant again.  <br /><br />I've been using this system for years now and it's great -- I only keep about a thousand or so emails in my main system and every email I ever receive is in my gmail.  Gmail has good search facilities so unless you can remember almost nothing about a message you want (\"Oh, I can't find that message from that guy a few months ago, what was he called, what did he want?\") then you can find the message easily.<br /><br />Another reason to recommend this rather than moving directly to \"just\" using gmail is that moving email address is MUCH more traumatic than moving postal address because it takes an age for people to update email address books.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's hard for me to advise you quite how to set this up because how to do it varies from system to system.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"January 7 2007, 10:46:16 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://steer.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"steer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"steer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://steer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"steer","ctime_ts":1168166776,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?replyto=1155473","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155473#t1155473","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155473#t1155473","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155473#t1155473","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1155473,"talkid":4513,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155473#t1155473","article":"For old e-mails (that are more than 1 year old), remember that :<br />- probably the sender is not expecting an answer anymore<br />- probably some questions/subjects are not as much relevant to the sender as they were <br />- maybe the sender has changed his e-mail address (spending time on an answer would be a waste of time)<br /><br />So I think you should have some kind of semi-automatic (pre-writen) anwers for old e-mails where you would explain that you would have liked to answer but that you lack time, and for the above reasons, you won't answer to mails that are getting too old. Suggest the fan can send another \"updated\" e-mail if he really feels it's worth it. Well, I don't know how to put it but you get the idea. You could also have two pre-written answers :<br />  - one for old mails you won't answer<br />  - one for old mails you keep and will try to answer<br />At least it will \"ping\" the sender e-mail address, and you'll detect e-mails to delete.<br /><br />The only other solution I see is the contrary : if you want to answer to all those emails, then admit it and spend the necessary time to do it. In the beginning of februray, don't start working on ADWD before you've answered all the fan e-mails from january you want to answer. Don't answer to mails from februry but do it in the beginning of march, etc. It means less time to write books, but if you really feel psychological pressure on the subject, one full day spent to write mail is not \"lost\" if you really feel better afterwards.  Of course, if it would require one week rather than one day per month, I suppose it wouldn't be viable.<br /><br />As others, I'd also suggest having one e-mail for fans and another for more personal and business subjects.<br /><br />Good luck with your mail, ADWD and your other projects !","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"January 7 2007, 11:37:11 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1168169831,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?replyto=1155729","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155729#t1155729","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155729#t1155729","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155729#t1155729","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sshi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sshi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1155729,"talkid":4514,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1155729#t1155729","upictitle":"go, smart girl, go!: pic#3805266","article":"I have a feeling that this is something that any successful author has to deal with after a while (not the losing email, but the mountain of unanswered email).

First, I'm very pleased that you consider responding to fan mail so important--I've never written you (and likely won't), but I'll never forget the response letter I got when I was a kid from an author I had written, and I'd imagine many fans would feel the same to get a response from you.  However, I want to echo the prevailing sentiment--while a response would be cherished, it's probably not why fans write to you.  Knowing you read fan letters is probably connection enough.<br /><br />Second, I think the way you process email could use some streamlining, and for that I recommend moving to the Getting Things Done (GTD) system.  I never received the volume of email I'm sure you do, but my inbox has been saved by doing this.  The premise is that whenever you read email, you have a few choices--you can respond immediately with a letter taking less than 2 minutes to write; you must respond to it as soon as possible, but the letter/action will take a while to craft; you must respond, but you have to wait until another event happens; you can archive it; you can delete it.  In my email account, I have three folders to accommodate this--Action, Hold, Archive.  Several times a day, I open my email, and evaluate each letter as I get it by first asking \"Do I need to respond to this?\" then \"Can I respond to it quickly right now?\"  If it gets moved to the Action folder, I set aside time every day to work through as many emails as possible, and then if it sits for over a week I re-evaluate if it needs to be responded to, and what might be preventing me from doing that (if anything).  Email, contrary to popular belief, is rarely urgent--you might also feel more free if you say \"I will check my email only after 3 pm,\" or something to that effect, so the thought of unresponded emails isn't weighing you down while doing other work.<br /><br />If you would like to go to this system for processing new email (and really, the evaporation of your old emails is a perfect opportunity to try something new), I suggest reading these articles at 43Folders, a GTD website--<br /><br />http://www.43folders.com/izero/<br /><br />as well as this article linked at Lifehacker--<br /><br />http://www.lifehacker.com/software/tag/g<wbr />etting-things-done-with-gmail-102158.php<br /><br />If you're interested in the book this all came from (which deals with a lot more than just email), it's here:  http://www.davidco.com/<br /><br />If you're still reading this, I'm impressed, and thanks for just looking at what I have to say.  :)    ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"January 7 2007, 13:24:04 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Getting Things Done + Email","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ext-27372.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/openid-profile.gif?v=5044?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ext_27372","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_27372","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=11983550&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"pixelicious.vox.com","ctime_ts":1168176244,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/56681830/10949036","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?replyto=1157265","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1157265#t1157265","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1157265#t1157265","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1157265#t1157265","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sudyn","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sudyn.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1157265,"talkid":4520,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/10129.html?thread=1157265#t1157265","upictitle":"suppurative mind: [-] cookie jar","article":"Hullo!<br />You could get an email address for private use, and have another to which your fans could send their mail.
