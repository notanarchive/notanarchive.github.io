(I vaguely recall a lauded indie film from about 10 years ago with a plot so complicated it was apparently mandatory to see it at least twice to have any chance at all of understanding it, which I didn't).<br /><br />Oddly enough, however, the only Heinlein novel I've managed to finish, <i>The Door Into Summer</i> features time travel, and, from memory, seems to - intentionally - reinforce my view that, even if possible, it can do no good. Much as I dislike the concept artistically, however, I have to admit to fantasising about it as much as anyone, and, given the chance, would be sorely tempted (e.g. to buy the hardcover of <i>A Game of Thrones</i> when I saw it at a reduced price, some months after publication, and dismissed as 'another fantasy novel').","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"January 14 2015, 19:59:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Predestination","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://andrew-mcguire.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"andrew_mcguire","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"andrew_mcguire","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://andrew-mcguire.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"andrew_mcguire","ctime_ts":1421265576,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126260951/72347384","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402055.html?thread=20100743#t20100743","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402055.html?thread=20100743#t20100743","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402055.html?thread=20100743#t20100743","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lostvalyrian","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lostvalyrian.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20100743,"talkid":78518,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/402055.html?thread=20100743#t20100743","upictitle":"lostvalyrian: pic#126260951","article":"I highly enjoyed the film also, and I went into it blind.
