{"itemid":1578,"subject":"Nipples Are Coming","event":"Let&#39;s turn from the latest cheating scandal involving the New England Patriots to a much more pleasant subject: breasts.\r\n\r\nIt is completely legal and acceptable for men to go shirtless in public throughout the United States.&nbsp; But in many states and cities, women do not have the same right.&nbsp; And heaven forfend there should be a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; during the SuperBowl or similar event that exposes the country to a brief split-second glimpse of a female nipple (actually a pastie, but don&#39;t confuse us with facts).&nbsp; GAME OF THRONES is often slammed for showing too many breasts as well.&nbsp; As are other cable shows.&nbsp; And of course you can&#39;t show them at all on broadcast television.\r\n\r\nOnly in America.&nbsp; Why do so many people in this country go mad at the sight of a nipple? \r\n\r\nAnyway, this Friday at the Jean Cocteau we are screening FREE THE NIPPLE, the docudrama about the women who led the fight for nipple equality in New York City.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"536\"/>\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is not New York, of course... but our Cocteau staff will be appropriately clad to honor the fearless women who are the subject of the movie.\r\n\r\nAnd we&#39;ll have Nipple-cakes too!\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies.","ditemid":404037,"eventtime":"2015-01-21
