{"itemid":1728,"subject":"Blacklist Burlesque Presents \"Burlesque is Coming: A Tribute to the Works of George R.R. Martin.\"","event":"Hello again from Ogre Jenni!\r\n\r\nA Virginia-based burlesque company, Blacklist Burlesque, will perform at Santa Fe&rsquo;s hometown theater, the Jean Cocteau Cinema, on Monday, September 14th and Tuesday, September 15th. Blacklist Burlesque promises a hilarious and sexy parody of George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s <i>Game of Thrones</i> series. View the specific times and purchase tickets here: http://bit.ly/1Kggk3a\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/event/burlesque-is-coming-game-of-thrones/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/274888/274888_600.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere are some silly quotes from Blacklist Burlesque:\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;For the night is dark and full of rhinestones.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Arya gonna come see us? Aw, c&rsquo;mon, you gotta have a Sansa humor!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBlacklist Burlesque refers to themselves as the &quot;first name and last word in Richmond, Virginia and beyond for neo-burlesque and nerd-lesque shows.&quot; They already had me at &quot;Burlesque,&quot; but they won my tiny black heart with &quot;nerd-lesque.&quot;\r\n\r\nHoly fishnets, Batman! I did not know that &ldquo;nerd-lesque&rdquo; was even a thing until we booked Blacklist Burlesque&rsquo;s <i>Game of Thrones</i>-themed act at the Cocteau. Apparently, in the world of nerd-lesque, there are <i>Star Trek </i>cabarets, super hero acts, high fantasty burlesque shows, and&mdash;quite frighteningly&mdash;Cthulhu strip-teases. There are just some things in this universe that the human mind shouldn&rsquo;t be exposed to. Or maybe I should just get out of my lair every once in a while.\r\n\r\nFor those who don&rsquo;t know the basic history of burlesque, it is an art form that has thumbed its nose at upper-class cultures and social conventions for hundreds of years. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the umbrella term &ldquo;burlesque&rdquo; covered many varieties of theatrical lampooning or &ldquo;travesty.&rdquo; In the 19th century, burlesque producers and performers would take specific arias and oratorios from famous operas, and rewrite the lyrics for comedic effect&mdash;just like &ldquo;Weird Al&rdquo; Yankovic! In other words, the middle and lower classes got to knock &ldquo;serious&rdquo; art off of its pedestal from time to time.\r\n\r\nBut what about the strip-tease, the feather costumes, and the pasties, you ask? Strip-tease, an important aspect of modern and neo-burlesque, became standard around the 1930s. Think of the bawdy cabaret culture of the 1930s&mdash;and then the pin-up girls of the 1940s and 1950s. Now this is just a brief overview from a humble ogre, so if any of you readers have any interesting or tantalizing tidbits to add about burlesque, please leave a comment&mdash;and see you at the show!","ditemid":442454,"eventtime":"2015-09-11 15:21:00","props":{"current_mood":"Greenish","current_location":"Still in My Lair","taglist":"neo-burlesque, jean cocteau cinema, blacklist burlesque, nerdlesque, game of thrones","homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1442362452,"current_music":"\"Eat It\" by Weird Al","opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Blacklist Burlesque Presents \"Burlesque is Coming: A Tribute to the Works of George R.R.
