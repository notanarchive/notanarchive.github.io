I love your writing.  You rock!<br /><br />But I'll I admit I created a LJ account for a singular purpose.  And that purpose is as follows:<br /><br />AHAHAHAHAHAHA GO PATS! AHAHAHAHA UNBEATEN! PERFECT! AGAINST YOUR GIANTS!<br /><br />It must be kind of sad to lose..I wouldn't know about that this season Mr. Martin!  I can only imagine the intense anguish and despair that this loss has provided for you, Mr. Martin.  This is particularly sweet after all of the Pats-bashing you've done.  Hopefully you are comforted knowing that FIFTEEN OTHER TEAMS have experienced the same sad feelings that you are wrapped in now.<br /><br />Now on to the Super Bowl!  Good luck facing the Bucs!  Maybe the Pats will see you later! (and that's a stretch) But look on the bright side..Eli Manning finally looked like a passable quarterback tonight! until he exploded in the fourth quarter...<br /><br />Life has plenty of meaning and purpose! (when you're a pats fan!)<br /><br />Okay but seriously.  I'll freely admit that you have valid reasons for disliking them.  Forgive this fan for sticking with his team through thick and thin.  If the Giants can play with the heart they showed tonight in the playoffs then they will be very dangerous.  Eli Manning cannot carry a team on his shoulders like Tom Brady or Peyton Manning can..  but he is not a detriment to the team as some have said.  You also have a talented defensive line that is very capable of disrupting offensive flow, which masks the secondary's problems. Good luck in the postseason! Seriously!<br /><br />Please pardon the gloating session! And let me say again that I love your books and can't wait for the sequels!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"December 30 2007, 07:00:22

The only team even close would be a healthy Colts team. With Dwight Freeney out, that defense is not nearly as scary.<br /><br />Some of the games were much closer than they should have been. Baltimore is a great example of a bad teams playing above their level against the Patriots (Losing a few weeks later to the Dolphins!?!).<br /><br />The whole cheating scandal is so blown out of proportion because of the Patriots success.  Other teams (if not all of them) have been accused of these type of things, and just have not been fully brought to light.  Perhaps it was in the Pat's case due to Mangini wanting to taint their image. They have been watched all season long, and will continue to be watched.<br /><br />As a Pat's fan, I have no problem admitting that Belichick is not a likable man, but he is damn good at what he does.  It just so happens that success will draw attention, and due to bitter opponents, often enough it's negative. The players on the Pat's have accomplished some amazing feats and people can't stomach to give credit where credit is due. <br /><br />Tom Brady and the Patriots play 60 minutes at the top of their game, which is often just not the case for their opponents.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"December 31 2007, 16:45:58 UTC","parent":2964649,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://richisonfire.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"richisonfire","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"richisonfire","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://richisonfire.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"richisonfire","ctime_ts":1199119558,"tracked":0}]}
