I remember reading that you're not a gamer, but this is kind of a special case. Most Telltale games are more visual novels than anything else anyway, less interested in gameplay and more interested in your choices and telling a story. <br /><br />When I first heard Telltale was making a GoT game, I have to admit I was kind of hoping it would take place in Westerosi history, like during Robert's Rebellion. That would allow them to tell their own story without getting too entangled in the TV plotlines, as well as give us a chance to meet a young Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon and so forth. It might have even introduced some of the Unsullied to Rhaegar Targaryen, a name which I'm guessing mostly produces blank stares amongst them right now. <br /><br />Ah well. Long story short, if you ever have a night where you plan to watch a movie, consider playing the first episode of this instead. It's worth it.
