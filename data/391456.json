{"itemid":1529,"subject":"Iron from Ice","event":"There&#39;s a new GAME OF THRONES computer game on the way, this one from Telltale Games.\r\n\r\nUnlike the earlier games from Cyanide, this is an HBO license, derived from the television series rather than the novels, so the characters will look like their TV incarnations, and in many cases will be voiced by the actors who play them on the show.&nbsp;&nbsp; The action is centered around House Forrester, bannermen to the Starks of Winterfell whose seat in the wolfswood.&nbsp; (Some Forresters are mentioned in the Stannis chapters, when he marches south from the Wall to attack Winterell, but very little is said about them, which made them ideal for game purposes).\r\n\r\nThe game will be sort of a side story to the show (and books), swirling and around major events.&nbsp; Ty Franck, my longtime assistant who went off to become half of James S.A. Corey and write the Expanse novels, acted as a consultant on story and continuity for Telltale.\r\n\r\nThe first teaser trailer has just been released.&nbsp; Have a look:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"514\" />","ditemid":391456,"eventtime":"2014-11-18 00:28:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"videogame, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1417550395,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Iron from Ice http://j.mp/11kYdu0","picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[{\"eng\":1},{\"rus\":0}],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1416864516}","revtime":1417550424},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-11-21 07:28:33","anum":32,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391456.html","event_timestamp":1416270480,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123743349/1999518","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391456.html?thread=19755040#t19755040","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391456.html?thread=19755040#t19755040","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391456.html?thread=19755040#t19755040","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"stelligera","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://stelligera.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19755040,"talkid":77168,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/391456.html?thread=19755040#t19755040","upictitle":"Urania: [misc] swing.","article":"Seven hells...

The first season of that game received heaps of well-deserved praise for its story and characters and for being genuinely sad. If you ever have free time (HA!), you should give it a shot, since it's less a real 'game' and more an interactive story. It's also pretty short, divided into five episodes typically under two hours long each.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in Season 2, but hopefully they learned some lessons from that going into this.<br /><br />I do have to admit, though, that I was kinda hoping they would do the same thing to your series that they did with TWD: namely, whether it was based on The Walking Dead TV show or The Walking Dead comic was almost irrelevant because it was telling its own story that just happened to share the same world. <br /><br />Westeros and Essos are so richly detailed that it seems kind of a pity to place too much emphasis on the familiar faces like Tyrion or Cersei, rather than allowing the new cast of characters to delve into a view of Westerosi politics we haven't seen before. <br /><br />Anyway, cautiously optimistic for this.
