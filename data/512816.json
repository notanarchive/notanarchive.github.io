{"itemid":2003,"subject":"Giants Win Again","event":"Hot damn, the Giants won again... and over a good team, the Detroit Lions, who are presently leading their division, and had a hot streak going, pulling out eight games this season in the fourth quarter.  \r\n\r\nBut not today.\r\n\r\nEli Manning had a solid game, but the heroes of the day were once again Odell Beckham Junior and the defense.   Odell's catch on the winning touchdown was a thing of beauty, another one-handed grab that no other wideout could possibly have snared.  The pass was seriously off target.  Victor Cruz had a nice catch as well, and the running game showed signs of life, at least when Perkins was in (having Pugh back on the O line made a huge difference). \r\n\r\nThe day really belonged to the D, though.  Game by game, quarter by quarter, they have been getting better and better, and now, I think, have to rank as one of the NFL's best.  Which delights me no end.  I love good defense, and the New York Giants as a franchise have always prided themselves on tough D.  It's part of Big Blue's heritage.  Having the worse D in the league last year was a disgrace.  So all hail to Spags, and Snacks, and T'Other Eli, and DRC, and Olivier Vernon.  Oh, and our punter, who kept pinning the Lions back inside their ten.\r\n\r\nWorrisome, however, was Jackrabbit Jenkins going out with a back injury in the first half.  He's been playing great, so I hope he comes back soon.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets, they played last night, and improved their position in next year's draft.  Nuff said.","ditemid":512816,"eventtime":"2016-12-18 17:22:00","props":{"current_mood":"cheerful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Dec 19 00:22:48 2016]R [Mon Dec 19 00:22:49 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/810641500480487424 ","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1482611822,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/810641500480487424","reading_time":2,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.698512235105191]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1482106997}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2003?v=1482649241","revtime":1482620953},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-19 00:22:45","anum":48,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html","event_timestamp":1482081720,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124756142/74868458","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25431856#t25431856","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25431856#t25431856","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25431856#t25431856","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bcd30","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bcd30.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25431856,"talkid":99343,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25431856#t25431856","upictitle":"Brian Dudek: pic#124756142","article":"Keep running the rock!

Their D is really good, no debate there, but they can't keep putting it on the D's back, it's going to come back and bite them. The Giants have the 27th ranked offense, scoring 19 points on average, while their D holds teams to about 17 points per game on average. But what happens when Odell is shutdown? And he can be shutdown; Norman, and Butler did it last year, and Xavier Rhodes did it this year. Odell is the heart of the offense, the moment that is taken away, the offense takes a big hit, the run game looked good today, but the Lions are 13th in total run D, so it's not like they did well against the Steelers, Cowboys, or the Ravens (the top three run D's).<br /><br />Compare this with the New England Patriots, who are 4th in total offense (that's with Brady missing 4 games). The Pats are 4th in passing, and 7th in rushing. And the Pats just beat, arguably, the best pass rush in the League. The amount of time Brady had against Denver was kinda nuts, if Denver's secondary hadn't been as amazing at it is, Brady would have picked them apart, and the Giants don't have anywhere near as good a secondary as Denver (though, no team does). And Brady is without the greatest Tight End of all time. And I don't even know if Gronk will play in the playoffs, or even in the Super Bowl (if we make it). But even without Big G, we just beat two of the best D's in the League.  <br /><br />I just don't know if the Giants can stand up to a team like the Seahawks, who will have Sherman put the clamps on Odell (he's the best CB in the League).

Patriots Giants for round 3, but Eli doesnt have his Yoda anymore. and this is the real world so Evil must win, right? P.S.: You dont want to hear this I am sure but what about that Steelers-Giants game? deflategate 2, walkie-talkie-gate... but those two families are married, the first born even got the other families name as a first name AND the commish does whatever John Mara wants him to do, no? I mean that is some classic middleages stuff right there.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"December 19 2016, 18:59:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"will we meet again Giants?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Prom000","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Prom000","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3459252","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77273269&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Prom000","ctime_ts":1482173974,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122952418/69406670","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25440048#t25440048","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25440048#t25440048","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25440048#t25440048","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2480238","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/dan.mackreedeez","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25440048,"talkid":99375,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/512816.html?thread=25440048#t25440048","upictitle":"Dan Mcreedeez: pic#122952418","article":"In these dark and bitter times, powerful, evil forces are on the rise, from both sides of the aisle.  On each side, evil rises and threatens to blot out light and love forever, and only the Promised One can save all of us.  I of course speak of the Patriots and the Cowboys, bitter, bitter, evil teams that must be stopped at all costs.  Only the Giants can beat both of them and ensure that 2017 isn't as bad as 2016, Eli must rise, as he has twice before, and become the Dopey Miracle Man from 2007 and 2011 and dispatch both of these dastardly villain squads.  <br /><br />I'm an Iggles fan, it hurts to root for the Giants, but the possibility of a Cowboys-Patriots Superbowl is too great, and only the Giants can bring hope back to the NFL.  <br /><br />I'm pulling for your boys in blue, may they possess the conviction to take this thing as far as it needs to go.
