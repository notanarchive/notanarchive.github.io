{"itemid":60,"subject":"NFL Draft, Day One","event":"Well, the first day of the NFL draft is finally over.  It was the longest first round in history, the longest first day in history.  I'm exhausted just from watching it.\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to evaluate a draft until three years after it's finished, but that doesn't stop anyone from trying.  Including me.\r\n\r\nMy two teams took completely different approaches this year.\r\n\r\nThe Jets were very aggressive.  They traded up in the first round to get the top corner in the draft, giving up one of their two second round picks to move up eleven slots or so.  Then they traded up again in the second round, this time surrendering their third rounder to snag a highly-rated linebacker who'd slid down significantly.  That left them without a third rounder.  Today's swaps and some previous moves also left them without a fourth or a fifth, so the Jets won't be drafting again until round six, and maybe not until round seven.  They are going to end up with a very small draft class, probably no more than four players.  On the other hand, the two guys they got today are prime, and both of them should make an immediate impact on the team.\r\n\r\nThe Giants, on the other hand, were totally passive.  With trades flying around like bullets and teams moving up and down and sideways and hopping over one another, the G-Men just sat there and picked when their turns came.  One, two, three.  Tomorrow, I expect, they will go four, five, six, and seven.  The first two of the three players they got today were solid, I think.  The first round cornerback will be of help to our aging secondary, and the second round wide receiver (Steve Smith -- I was actually hoping the Carolina Panthers would draft him a couple pick earlier, so they could start Steve Smith and Steve Smith as their wideouts) looks be pretty decent as well (however, if Amani Toomer comes back and Sinorice Moss finally plays some, the Giants won't really need another wide receiver).  The third round pick seemed like a real reach -- all the draft magazines had him rated as a sixth or seventh rounder.  The biggest problem is, the Giants did nothing to address their most pressing need -- a left tackle to replace Luke Pettigout and fortify the offensive line.  Last season, when Eli faded down the stretch, I was screaming for the Hefty Lefty.  Well, I have a feeling that I may get to see him this year.  Unless the Giants do something to fix that line, Eli is going to bloody well get killed back there.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I thought the Jets had a much better day than the Giants did.\r\n\r\nOf course, when watching the draft, a true fan not only wants his own teams to do well, he wants their archrivals to do poorly.  That worked out better for me, I think.  The Eagles traded away their first round pick, and then took a quarterback with their first pick of the day, in the early second round.  That won't please Donovan McNabb at all, and certainly did nothing to strengthen the team.  He wasn't even an especially great prospect, according to most of the commentators.  I think Andy Reid shot himself in the foot.\r\n\r\nEven at that, he did better than the Miami Dolphins, who shot themselves in the head.  When Detroit, Cleveland, and then Minnesota passed on Brady Quinn, I was screaming and cursing, because that meant he would fall into the lap of the Dolphins, and finally solve their long-standing quarterback problem.  I visualized myself cursing his name for the next fifteen years, as he led the Dolphins to victories over the Jets just like Danny Marino just to do.  But then the Dolphins punted their brains, and passed on Quinn to pick a speedy wideout / kick returner coming off an injured foot.  No one in Radio City Music Hall could believe it, and neither could I.  I think the Miami fans will remember this day with as much fondness as Jets fans remember the day we passed on Marino to select Ken O'Brien... the day we passed on Emmitt Smith to take Blair Thomas... the day we passed on Warren Sapp to pick Kyle Brady... \r\n\r\nAnd it's great that it someone else's turn to be really, really stupid.\r\n\r\nAs for the other great rival of the Jets, the Pats of New England... well, there I am less sanguine.  The Patriots wheeled and dealed and traded down and down again, and wound up with only one pick today... but they have stockppiled something like forty-seven for tomorrow, and Scott Pioli and The Vile Belichick have a satanic skill at the finding gems in the later rounds.  The Patriots draft doesn't look like much right now, but I have the feeling that by the end of training camp, they'll have the usual hatful of talented young players.  \r\n\r\nAnd Dallas, well... to tell the truth, they moved around so much I don't have any sense of what the hell they were doing.  They traded up, they traded down, they did this and that, and who the hell knows?  The big thing is actually next year.  The Cleveland Browns gave up their first round pick in next year's draft so they could go up and pick Brady Quinn... which means I have to root for the Browns to do well next year, since I don't want the despised Cowboys to get a primo choice.  Go, Brownies, go!\r\n\r\nBrady Quinn's fall was the big story of the day.  From where I sit, it wasn't warranted.  I think Al Davis made a mistake.  In the long run, Brady Quinn will have a better pro career than Jamarcus Russell.  Yes, yes, Russell has a \"cannon for an arm,\" as I heard fifty times today.  I've seen a lot of cannon-armed quarterbacks come and go in the years that I've been watching football.  Bert Jones had a cannon for an arm.  Richard Todd.  Roman Gabriel.  Jeff George.  Kerry Collins.  I'd rather have a Joe Montana or a Phil Simms.  The fact that Russell can fling the ball eighty years off his back foot is only likely to be relevant if the Raiders sign Quicksilver and The Flash as wideouts.\r\n\r\nWe'll know for sure in ten years or so, I guess.  And have a clue in three.\r\n\r\nThat's why they play the games.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there's another day of draft tomorrow.","ditemid":15584,"eventtime":"2007-04-28 22:03:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","commentalter":1195893927,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-04-29 04:41:27","anum":224,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html","event_timestamp":1177797780,"reply_count":70,"comments":[{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"metamorphage","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1884640,"talkid":7361,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1884640#t1884640","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"metamorphage","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"metamorphage","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"metamorphage","ctime_ts":1177823065,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"metamorphage","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1884896,"talkid":7362,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1884896#t1884896","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"metamorphage","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"metamorphage","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"metamorphage","ctime_ts":1177823175,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91653769/6729305","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?replyto=1885152","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1885152#t1885152","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1885152#t1885152","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1885152#t1885152","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"murry_duck","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://murry-duck.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1885152,"talkid":7363,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1885152#t1885152","upictitle":"murry_duck: myself and Mary!

I think they may have pulled the trigger a bit quick on getting Revis when Leon Hall lasted until 18. But then again when you have a chance to get the player you want, you get him. I think the David Harris pick was better and they got him right where most expected him to go until he shot up the draft boards in the past two weeks. He is an excellent ILB for a 3-4 and a much better fit than Vilma for the run-stuffer ILB, and it should allow Vilma to take the role of the cover ILB. Now if they can only get Robertson to do better at the NT spot...<br /><br />As for the Giants, I am sure they were hoping that Hall would drop to them but what can you do. After that, meh...<br /><br />I will say this much: The Patriots absolutely hated this draft. You sit there waiting for 6 hours for your team to make their second pick and they trade out of the round. Oh well, 2 <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a>'s and 2 <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%233\">#3</a>'s for next year. <br /><br />I was telling my wife about the irony of which team you cheer for when you get their pick in the next year's draft. Last season I was rooting for the 49ers to beat out the Seahawks because the Pats had the Seahawks' pick. Now I am rooting for the Seahawks to beat the 49ers because the Pats have the 49ers' pick. I wonder if the Pats are trying to work their way through the NFC West.

Well. <br /><br />Sports Illustrated (which came into my hands by strange coincidence, because we usually don't get that out here, either) had an article on JaMarcus Russell, with a comparison to Quinn.

Quinn had \"too many\" starts, so the witchdoctors could analyze him to death (even though a high number of college starts is one of the key indicators of future NFL performance for a QB, according to SI), while Russell didn't have that many and really only had a run of good games towards the end.<br /><br />Russell's size and strength really seems to have impressed folks, I guess.

In ten years, one or both of these quarterbacks could have gone the way of Ryan Leaf, and we'll look back on this day and laugh.<br /><br />I suspect Jamarcus Russell will not start from Day 1, regardless.  They should probably throw the new McCown kid they picked up into the meat grinder until he's completely useless.  At least have a season.  If Russell becomes a rookie starter, I suspect he'll have a David Carr-like career and not a Vince Young-like one.<br /><br />I also never feel sorry for a quarterback who slips from the top 5 to a later part of the round.  In most cases, this usually means you go to a team that made or just missed the playoffs and has a much better offensive line to protect him.  I was pushing for him to replace Trent Green at Kansas City.  Unfortunately for him, the Cleveland Clowns swooped back into the first round to grab him.  So, he'll be on a team that was bad enough for a top 5 pick, but getting paid as if he were on a team that can protect him much better.<br /><br />The Miami pick was the same thing the Raiders did with their first pick last year.  They had Matt Leinart still on the board, and instead they reached down for a safety, Michael Huff.  In all regards, Huff is looking like he's going to go to the Pro Bowl several times in his career, given his good rookie season, but the Raiders had to come back this year and get a quarterback anyway.  Personally, I think Leinart was/still is a better talent/prospect at quarterback than this year's entire quarterback class.  As for Miami, it just means they're already in the running for next year's <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a> pick.<br /><br />The Giants did the same thing my Steelers do every year.  They traded up once in the first round, that I can remember, and got S Troy Polamalu, so it was definitely worth it.  They never trade away subsequent years' picks for one this year, like I've seen Baltimore and now Cleveland do.  The Giants' pick was at least discussed with a bit of intrigue.  The Steelers' pick was telegraphed in 2 months ago by all draft speculators, so except for the pick-by-pick analysis ESPN had, it wasn't even discussed.  I figured Coughlin would show more initiative, though, and do something risky to keep him job, like Romeo Crennel did in Cleveland.  If you suspect this is your last year as head coach if you don't succeed, why not gamble off someone else's future for a higher chance of success this year.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2007, 11:28:20 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://alphaant.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"alphaant","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"alphaant","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://alphaant.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"alphaant","ctime_ts":1177846100,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?replyto=1908192","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1908192#t1908192","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1908192#t1908192","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1908192#t1908192","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"getouttatheway","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://getouttatheway.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1908192,"talkid":7453,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1908192#t1908192","above":1886944,"upictitle":"getouttatheway: pic#0","article":"\"I suspect he'll have a David Carr-like career and not a Vince Young-like one.\"<br /><br />Interesting comment considering that Vince Young hasn't had a career as yet.<br /><br />I think Vince Young will be similar to Michael Vick -

Alas, there is only one of him, and when the Pats go into their new eight-receiver spread, well....<br /><br />Pioli is a great personnel man, and the Vile Belichick is an evil genius.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2007, 23:56:57 UTC","parent":1891040,"massactions":0,"subject":"Randy Moss","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1177891017,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1893344#t1893344","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1893344#t1893344","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1893344#t1893344","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lno","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lno.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1893344,"talkid":7395,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1893344#t1893344","above":1893088,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","below":1895904,"parent":1893088,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Randy Moss","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lno.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lno","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lno","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lno.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lno","ctime_ts":1177896698,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1895904#t1895904","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1895904#t1895904","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1895904#t1895904","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"zengoalie","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://zengoalie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1895904,"talkid":7405,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1895904#t1895904","above":1893344,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","parent":1893088,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Randy Moss","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://zengoalie.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"zengoalie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"zengoalie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://zengoalie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"zengoalie","ctime_ts":1177945297,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/35870214/824471","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?replyto=1891296","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1891296#t1891296","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1891296#t1891296","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1891296#t1891296","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"snaidvooar","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://snaidvooar.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1891296,"talkid":7387,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1891296#t1891296","upictitle":"Rick: TV Bad","article":"I might actually watch the draft if the teams had 10 minutes to pick, instead of 15.

What has he done for the Packers as of late? While some say it is because of Favre, there are many reports that Rogers never really quite panned out.<br /><br />The Miami Dolphins also did draft a QB in the second round, remember often the Quarterback who wins the Superbowl isn't a first round pick (though in the last two years it has been). Tedd Ginn Jr. is definetly a very odd pick as high as he went, but it is possible that the Dolphins saw something. It is really hard to chose a wide receiver in the first round because of the nature of the position. A wide receiver really only gets a maximum of maybe 15 touches per game, as opposed to a rb who will probably see about 30 etc. <br /><br />Your point about the 80 yard throw is pretty good, also if you watch the footage of the throw you'll see the throw is pretty easy to intercept. However you miss the point about Russel. His only good point isn't his arm, he also makes very good throws, and by good I mean NFL level throws. Also his size makes him very tough to deal with because it is hard to deal with him in the pocket.<br /><br />The Cowboys have done a good job drafting and filling their needs, I was kinda hoping that the Ravens would have moved up and taken Brady Quinn.<br /><br />On a side note I am also suprised that Michael Bush was drafted in the 4rth round, i had him pegged in the late 3rd.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2007, 18:51:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sensorglitch.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sensorglitch","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sensorglitch","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sensorglitch.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sensorglitch","ctime_ts":1177872679,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?replyto=1892576","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892576#t1892576","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892576#t1892576","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892576#t1892576","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"faeriesluver9","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://faeriesluver9.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1892576,"talkid":7392,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892576#t1892576","above":1891808,"upictitle":"Chelsea: pic#28146247","article":"I was hoping we might get Brady as well, but we needed a o-lineman more than a quarterback, because otherwise we'd have a dead quarterback.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"April 29 2007, 22:39:45 UTC","parent":1891808,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://faeriesluver9.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"faeriesluver9","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"faeriesluver9","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://faeriesluver9.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"faeriesluver9","ctime_ts":1177886385,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/39042454/8994890","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?replyto=1892064","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892064#t1892064","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892064#t1892064","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892064#t1892064","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lachaim","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lachaim.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1892064,"talkid":7390,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15584.html?thread=1892064#t1892064","upictitle":"lachaim: Eyes","article":"Well, you were correct, the Patriots certainly had something up their sleeve.
