{"itemid":513,"subject":"Pick Your Pewter Poison","event":"Dark Sword Miniatures has been rolling along merrily this past year with their range of pewter miniatures from A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE.  Tom Meier and Jeff Grace have turned out some fabulous sculpts, and in recent months Dark Sword has released gorgeous minis of Sansa and her snow castle, Arya with her sword, Lady Catelyn, Brienne, the Mountain and the Red Viper in their famous duel, Robb Stark, and many more.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, in February 2008, I ran a poll here, so you could let Dark Sword and me know which characters you wanted to see next.  The four winners -- Tyrion, Robb, Brienne, and the Red Viper -- have now all been produced.  So have runners-up Catelyn Stark and Asha Greyjoy, and figures of Samwell Tarly and Shae are in the works.\r\n\r\nSo it's time for another poll.  Let us know which characters you'd like to see Dark Sword do next, and we will do our damndest to get them in the queue.\r\n\r\nThe poll will follow.","ditemid":131414,"eventtime":"2010-02-02 19:46:00","props":{"taglist":"minatures, dark sword","current_moodid":99,"commentalter":1265166727,"personifi_word_count":172,"picture_keyword":"tyrion","opt_screening":"F","interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"17:5,18:5,6:5,31:5,10:11,33:27,42:5,32:5,29:16,3:11,20:50,9:16,22:11,nterms:yes","verticals_list":"science"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-02-03 02:46:46","anum":86,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/131414.html","event_timestamp":1265139960,"reply_count":1,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/66560804/11390144","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/131414.html?replyto=8554070","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/131414.html?thread=8554070#t8554070","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/131414.html?thread=8554070#t8554070","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/131414.html?thread=8554070#t8554070","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jimvanpelt","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jimvanpelt.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8554070,"talkid":33414,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/131414.html?thread=8554070#t8554070","upictitle":"jimvanpelt: Saturn Ring Blues","article":"That has to be very cool to see your literary creations made corporeal in pewter (and then hand painted!).
