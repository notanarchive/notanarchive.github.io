{"itemid":2032,"subject":"Wild Cards Coming Atcha","event":"Got some cool stuff coming down the pike for Wild Cards fans... especially those of you who came in with INSIDE STRAIGHT or FORT FREAK or one of our other recent Tor originals, and have been seeking high and low for the older books ever since.\r\n\r\nMany of those older books are, alas, still out of print.  But Tor has reissued the first five volumes in trade paperback, and now we're bring back volumes six and seven as well.\r\n\r\nACE IN THE HOLE is our sixth volume.  Set during the dramatic (and bloody) Democratic National Convention of 1988, this one is a full mosaic, weaving together stories from Melinda M. Snodgrass (Dr. Tachyon), Walton Simons (Demise), Stephen Leigh (Puppetman), Walter Jon Williams (Golden Boy), and Victor Milan (Mackie Messer).  Look for the new trade paperback on <i><b>FEBRUARY 28</b></i>.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/417496/417496_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/417496/417496_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a>\r\n\r\nDEAD MAN'S HAND, volume seven, is a companion piece to ACE IN THE HOLE.  In fact, the two were actually one book, until it got too big and our publisher asked for a split.  DMH takes place during the same week as AITH, the former mostly in New York City, the latter mostly in Atlanta.  This one is a mosaic too, but with only two writers: John Jos. Miller writing Yeoman, and yours truly with Jay Ackroyd, aka Popinjay.  Which makes it more of a collaborative novel, really.  This is our noir novel, a classic mean streets murder mystery with superpowers.  It will be great to have it back in print after so long.   Look for it on <i>JUNE 13</i>. \r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/417739/417739_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/417739/417739_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a>\r\n\r\n((Both of those covers are by the amazing Michael Komarck.  Do remember that name when you're making your Hugo nominations for Best Professional Artist, Komarck is way overdue)).\r\n\r\nOH, and hey... on other Wild Card fronts, there's a cool new post up on the WC website, wherein David Anthony Durham confesses how he stole his IBT character from his son.  ;)  You can check it out here:\r\nhttp://www.wildcardsworld.com/\r\n\r\nFight the good fight, boys and girls.

Instead, I'm writing to provide information, in light of your statements about avoiding fan forums. This is no doubt an excellent idea but there's one issue I hope you know about as it could affect posterity's view of the finished work. The \"Murder of Jon Arryn\" is a resolved mystery worthy of Dame Agatha herself and superior to all but a handful of her greatest works. But there are two other mysteries that the HBO show seems to think are also resolved. The information I want to give you is that a massive portion of the fandom is not convinced and the debate rages on endlessly. I'm hoping that this is your intention, but if you're not aware of the controversies I'm writing to give you a heads up. The big one is \"The Murder of Joffrey Baratheon\". Everyone has gone over and over all the pertinent chapters with their microscopes and the version shown on HBO simply isn't provable anywhere near beyond a shadow of a doubt. The other one is \"Cat and the Catspaw\". Over a decade ago you publicly said that this would be settled in A Storm of Swords, but I'm here to tell you that it most certainly is not! Even Mance and his bag of silver are suspected! If it is Joff, I think literature teachers in 200 years would thank you greatly if you confirmed it before the end of the series. Thanks to you or your minion for reading this. I consider ASOIAF to be arguably the greatest work of fiction ever written and I wait with supreme patience for the next installment.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"February 9 2017, 00:07:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"quick private message","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/116730841571516183122","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Kevin Moore","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4010398","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81081079&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Kevin Moore","ctime_ts":1486598874,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/520414.html?thread=25727710#t25727710","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/520414.html?thread=25727710#t25727710","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/520414.html?thread=25727710#t25727710","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25727710,"talkid":100498,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/520414.html?thread=25727710#t25727710","above":25727198,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I have an important question regarding TWOW. Spanish is my first language and I have read all your books in spanish before. I love going into the ASOIAF Reddit as well as watching Youtube videos about your books. The question I have is regarding the publication date for other languages. Do You know if your publishers have in mind publishing the book in different languages at the same time it's published in english? I mean are the translations to other languages made after the book is published in english or do they translate the manuscript almost inmediately before your english publication? I ask you this 'cause it would be way too easy to get spoiled about the book if the spanish version takes too long to get published in comparision to the english version and I'm sure is the same case for Italian, French, German, etc. So anyway I hope you can answer this question that has been bugging me for a long time.

I´m pretty new with this series, finished the fifth book about four months ago, and I´m eager to read more of it.<br />Demise was one of my favourite POV´s in Jokers Wild and I grew more and more fond of Golden Boy (who had, in my opinion, one of the most powerful storylines in the first book)<br />I´m really looking forward to this books, especially since you have stepped up you \"villain game\" in the second trilogy quiet a bit. The astronomer was fun and threatening and all, but compared to puppetman he seems pretty boring.<br />The characters in wildcards in generell are just amazing, damn I´m still kind of mourning Xavier Desmond.<br />So yeah, Im glad to see more of the wildcards soon and hope that the books 8+ don´t let me wait for them too long.

Its message of tolerance and perseverance is desperately needed in this day and age. It is also amazing what can happen when you have tremendously talented and hard working people collaborate. Congratulations! I hope it can make a dent in the rather primitive story-telling that we are getting in the movies of late with our superheroes anyway. Bad political commentary. Inarticulate heroes. Plots that make no sense. Wildcards is a welcome respite. It's really fascinating how each volume reflects and reflects on its era so well.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"February 10 2017, 04:15:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Wildcards Rebirth","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1124887310942332/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Williamjames Hoffer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3966624","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=80328214&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Williamjames Hoffer","ctime_ts":1486700117,"tracked":0}]}
