{"itemid":369,"subject":"Home Again","event":"Back home, safe and sound. Finland was great and I enjoyed my visit to Estonia as well.  More on both later.  The journey home was endless and exhausting, and god, I hate the TSA, especially the ones at Chicago O'Hare.  Petty pseudopolice drunk on their authority.  But never mind. \r\n\r\nTons of emails, a mountain of mail, much sleep to catch up on.  I'll be digging out from under for a while.  But lots of cool stuff happening too, on all sorts of fronts.  I'll post what I can when I can.\r\n\r\nNext trip on the schedule is worldcon in Montreal.  I have my program for that, and will post it here soon.  I'm hoping to complete a few more chapters for DANCE before taking off.
