{"itemid":271,"subject":"More On the Calendars","event":"Les Dabel writes:\r\n\r\n\"I am on it right now.  It looks like within 7 to 10 business days all this should be cleared up.  I am also waiting for the extra copies from Quebecor so I can send to you to sign.  The packages for these 250 copies have already been put together.  So once we receive them from you we will send them right out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd once I receive them, I will announce it here.\r\n\r\nIn another email, Les says:\r\n\r\n\"The worst problem we've had is the international orders.  Because the packages were under 1 pound we were told that we did not need custom forms filled out with the packages.  Well they were incorrect even though the packages were under 1 pound they were slightly larger than a package that did not require a customs form.  I've received pretty much everyone of the international orders back.  I've been resending them out with the custom forms.  I was doing a great job responding to people emailing us about their calendars up until last week when I pulled a back muscle from carrying boxes and was out for pretty much the whole week.  This weekend I've been emailing the customers and updating them and making sure replacements are being sent.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway... I am hopeful that we are on our way to getting the problems fixed, and that within a couple of weeks (perhaps longer for the overseas orders) everyone who paid for a calendar will have one.\r\n \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002cqck/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002cqck/s320x240\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n(That's February, by the way.

Problems happen, but DB seems to always be three steps behind each problem and doesn' react until way after the problem arose.  Les, if you're gonna be out for a week with a back problem, be proactive.  Most business' have this out of office assistant with email so if you know you're gonna be out you can turn that on and every person who emails you will know that you're out of the office!  <br /><br />Also blaming these shipping issues on the post office is no good excuse either.  Yeah, some of thes shipping problems may be a result of that, but if you keep having problems with the post office, start using Fedex or UPS.  I use those in my job and they are very good at getting packages shipped and delivered on time. <br /><br />Lastly, George is right, SEND THE F'ing CALENDARS TO BE SIGNED! The people who ordered these were your first customers and paid the most for the calendars.  Make them happy!  I recieved an unsigned copy of the exclusive cover(which is very beautiful and well made), so I know those have been made, what's the hold up?  How hard is it to send over 250 to George to have them signed??  <br /><br />PS- February's is definitely one of the best ones in the calendar.  Probably May's after that in my opinion.

Since the contents of the packages are items that were purchased, the size of the package has no bearing whatsover.<br /><br />See, if a business mails someone a letter in a legal sized envelope, customs will just assume there is nothing in there being sold.  It's just mail.  <br /><br />But, if there WAS something in there being sold, say tickets to a rock concert, or a CALENDAR and the business didn't declare them as a sale and provide the true value on USPS's infamous \"green customs sticker\" and stuck it to the outside of the envelope, it would technically be considered fraud.  <br /><br />Ebay sellers shipping internationally get around this all the time by using their personal name in the shipping info instead of the name of their business (if they are a business, anyway) and calling the contents a gift.  That's fraud too, but it tends to get overlooked since it usually is a person to person transaction.<br /><br />But if there is a business's name on the shipper address, the scrutiny at the border goes up a few notches.  All the more so if the package is not a normal sized envelope, or if it's bubble wrapped, or whatever.<br /><br />It sounds like he was trying to sneak these through without the receiver having to pay taxes or duties on the goods.

Thanks for sticking up for your fans! I created this livejournal account for the sole purpose of posting here about the calendar. I have sent an email to you a while ago at some AOL address but I am not sure if it is the right one. Would you mind posting your current email address? <br /><br />I agree with the posters above, in that I will not believe anything Les dabel says until the calendar arrives. It's 3 months overdue, and he's given me a shitload of excuses. My advice is that he should not charge customers unless he is ACTUALLY planning to ship the product. If I do not receive my calendar by mid-year I am going to ask Les for a refund as well as a free calendar for wasting my time and making interest revenue off my payment. George, if you have time I recommend you go over to Les Dabel forums and take a look for yourself at just how many angry and unfulfilled customers there are. I seriously recommend you to consider terminating this 3 year contract. Angry fans for 3 years straight is not a pleasant experience for anyone.<br /><br />Thanks for your time!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 5 2009, 04:21:14 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"les dabel service sucks","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bunnyhopperwtf.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bunnyhopperwtf","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bunnyhopperwtf","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bunnyhopperwtf.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bunnyhopperwtf","ctime_ts":1233807674,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/69596.html?replyto=5193692","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/69596.html?thread=5193692#t5193692","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/69596.html?thread=5193692#t5193692","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/69596.html?thread=5193692#t5193692","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bunnyhopperwtf","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bunnyhopperwtf.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5193692,"talkid":20287,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/69596.html?thread=5193692#t5193692","upictitle":"bunnyhopperwtf: pic#85128124","article":"Regarding Les's \"customs form\" thing:<br />Last week I received (sending back and forth emails with Les) another email explaining to me the customs issue.

Well its basically Thursday so there's another broken promise.
