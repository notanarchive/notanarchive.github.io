{"itemid":1025,"subject":"Hugo Awards - Closing Comments","event":"A few final thoughts on this year's Hugo Awards before I move on to other topics...\r\n\r\nBesides Best Novel (the Big One), there are three additional fiction awards, for various lengths of short fiction.  Best Novella (the Not Quite So Big One), Best Short Story (the Little One), and Best Novelette (the In Between One).  These awards are often the place where younger, newer writers first make their names, and tend to be dominated by stories from the magazines... ANALOG, ASIMOV'S, F&SF.  That has been changing in recent years, with the rise of e-magazines.  I did not read much short fiction last year, either in the magazines or on line, but LOCUS has an excellent recommended reading list for short fiction, and I'm sure the readers of this blog will have their own favorites.\r\n\r\nStories published in anthologies are also eligible in these categories.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the anthologies I edited in 2011: FORT FREAK, the latest Wild Cards anthology, and DOWN THESE STRANGE STREETS, the fantasy/ mystery anthology I did with Gardner Dozois.  Lots of good work in both, I think.  In particular, let me draw your attention to \"Lord John and the Plague of Zombies,\" by Diana Gabaldon, and \"The Adakian Eagle,\" by Bradley Denton, from STRANGE STREETS.  Those two stories were recently nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for Edgar Awards.  In the Hugos, they would count as novellas.  Cherie Priest's FORT FREAK interstitial, \"The Rat Race,\" is also eligible in novella, and the Stephen Leigh triptych from that book, \"Hope We Die Before We Get Old,\" is a novelette tour de force that will break your heart.  \r\n\r\nThere are two awards for editing.  For Best Editor, Short Form, I'd recommend my partner in crime, GARDNER DOZOIS, both for his Best of the Year and the books we edit together.  And of course I am eligible myself in that same category.  For Best Editor, Long Form, my strongest recommendation goes to ANNE GROELL, of Bantam Spectra.  An amazing editor who has been with me every step of the way on A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, since 1996.  \r\n\r\nThe Best Fanzine category is one of the oldest Hugo Awards, but is currently embroiled in controversy.  Traditional print fanzines are still around, though both their numbers and their readership are dwindling, and in recent years the fans have been nominating things like e-zines, blogs, and podcasts in this category.  Last year at Reno, a rules change was enacted to exclude all those new forms of fanac from this category.  If that change is ratified in Chicago, Best Fanzine will once again become the exclusive property of traditional fanzines.  If you don't own a mimeograph machine, you need not apply.  However, (1) the change needs to be ratified, if it is defeated at this year's business meeting, it will not take effect, (2) it is NOT in effect this year, so this may be the last year when e-zines, blogs, and podcasts can be nominated in the category.  As I think you can tell by my sarcastic tone, I am opposed to the change.  I think there are some great fannish blogs and e-zines and podcasts out there, I think they are the future, and I'm going to nominate a bunch of them.  Some of my own favorites include PAT'S FANTASY HOTLIST, THE WERTZONE, MAKING LIGHT, THE BLOG OF THE FALLEN (okay, he doesn't like my stuff, but it's still a good read), STOMPING ON YETI, CHEESE MAGNETS, HATHOR LEGACY, and PUNKADIDDLE.  And for Best Fan Writer, I'd suggest you consider some of the folks who write for these blogs and e-zines, including Patrick St. Denis, Adam Whitehead, Adam Roberts, and John J. Miller.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there is Best Graphic Novel, one of the newest categories, added just a couple of years ago.  Actually, I am not well acquainted with the eligibility rules for this one yet.  Many graphic novels are published initially as monthly comic books, with runs extending over several years; later, when the story is complete, the issues are collected and issued as trade paperbacks.  My understanding is that a graphic novel becomes eligible for the Hugo the year it finishes, not the year it starts.  (Or any in between years, if the comics series runs for more than two years).  So it is the trade paperback that counts.  (If this is wrong, no doubt some SMOF will come and correct me.  Please do).  If my understanding is correct, then the GAME OF THRONES comic book is NOT eligible in this category, since its run is still ongoing.  However, I did have two other graphic novels published in trade paperback in 2011: FEVRE DREAM from Avatar and DOORWAYS from IDW.  Both of those would be eligible, I think.\r\n\r\nAs for all the other categories... and the Campbell Award for Best New Writer... I have no suggestions... but maybe you do.  Please share them.  I try to recommend good work here, but I also like to hear what other people recommend.\r\n\r\nWhatever you choose to nominate, please NOMINATE. \r\n\r\nThe nomination deadline is not till March, so we all have some time to do more reading.  However, you must be a member of Renovation (last year's worldcon), Chicon 7 (this year's worldcon), or LoneStarCon (next year's worldcon) by JANUARY 31 to have nomination privileges, and that deadline is almost upon us.  \r\n\r\nThe ballot can be found at: https://chicon.org/hugo/nominate.php","ditemid":262407,"eventtime":"2012-01-29 12:04:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1328383441,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1328680289},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-01-29 19:38:39","anum":7,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html","event_timestamp":1327838640,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/34996430/1395886","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15333895#t15333895","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15333895#t15333895","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15333895#t15333895","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15333895#t15333895","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"shsilver","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://shsilver.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15333895,"talkid":59898,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15333895#t15333895","article":"E-zines will still be eligible under the new fanzine rule.

In this respect, the rules are exactly the same as they are to novels serialized in multiple issues of magazine; they're eligible once the last part appears, not when the standalone novelization is published. Thus the trade paperback (to give your example) is <em>not</em> what counts.

It doesn't matter if they are words (written fiction), moving images (dramatic presentation), or sequential art (graphic story); the same serialization rules apply everywhere.<br /><br />I'd point to the reference in the WSFS Constitution, but the Chicon 7 web site, which has the current constitution, seems to be down right now.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"January 29 2012, 23:11:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kevin_standlee","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kevin_standlee","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kevin_standlee","ctime_ts":1327878698,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/35359286/1545596","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15337479#t15337479","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15337479#t15337479","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15337479#t15337479","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"timill","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://timill.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15337479,"talkid":59912,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262407.html?thread=15337479#t15337479","above":15335943,"upictitle":"Tim Illingworth: default jasper library","article":"It's back now at <a href='https://chicon.org/constitution.php' rel='nofollow'>https://chicon.org/constitution.php</a><wbr /><br /><br /><i>3.2.6: Works appearing in a series are eligible as individual works, but the series as a whole is not eligible.

It's very unclear whether a web site that didn't have obvious discrete issues would be allowed into the category, but it's also never become something upon which the administrators have had to rule because the voters have never nominated such a web site.<br /><br />Two Worldcons (2002, 2005) trialed a Best Web Site category, but the Business Meeting resisted efforts to create it as a standalone category, and there have been no recent attempts to do so.<br /><br />The main argument I've heard made for considering fancasts separately from fanzines is that it's parallel to the distinction we make between written fiction and dramatic presentations, and that if one opposes this distinction, one would have no problem getting rid of the existing dramatic presentation categories and having movies and television shows nominated in the Novel, Novella, etc. categories based on how many words were in their scripts.<br /><br />This year we have a somewhat odd situation in that Chicon 7 has added Best Fancast, using the same wording as the proposed new category, as a special category, while technically anything eligible for Best Fancast would also be eligible (this year only) in Best Fanzine.
