{"itemid":1179,"subject":"Oh, My Poor Jets","event":"Yes, they won today.  They beat the Arizona Cardinals 7-6.\r\n\r\nIn all my years of watching NFL football, I don't think I ever seen a more dreadful game.  I suppose I could argue that both defenses played wonderfully, but no, the offenses stank up the joint.\r\n\r\nI had to keep looking at the sideline shots to make sure Rich Kotite hadn't come sneaking back to coach the Jets again.  But no, that was still Rex Ryan.\r\n\r\nAfter Mark Sanchez threw three interceptions, Rex finally pulled him and put in Greg McElroy, who threw for the Jets only score.  McElroy did energize the crowd, but he did not exactly light up the joint.  It was mostly Shonn Green and the running game that moved the ball.\r\n\r\nWill it be Sanchez, McElroy, or Tebow next week?  No idea.  I doubt Rex knows either.\r\n\r\nSigh.  Suffering is the lot of the Jets fan.  It's all because Joe Willie made that deal with Satan at the crossroads...","ditemid":302058,"eventtime":"2012-12-02 14:48:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":75,"commentalter":1354647886,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1355190560},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-12-02 21:48:33","anum":234,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/302058.html","event_timestamp":1354459680,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119442979/9336014","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/302058.html?thread=16920554#t16920554","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/302058.html?thread=16920554#t16920554","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/302058.html?thread=16920554#t16920554","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"xraytheenforcer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://xraytheenforcer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16920554,"talkid":66095,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/302058.html?thread=16920554#t16920554","upictitle":"Xray Is As Xray Does: grizzly","article":"Man, I was hoping that you weren't watching that game.
