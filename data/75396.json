{"itemid":294,"subject":"Thanks","event":"The flood of support I have received in the last day has been overwhelming.\r\n\r\nMore than four hundred comments on the DWD posting, and more every time I glance at it.  I can hardly keep up with the unscreening.  (My assistant, Ty, who normally handles that for me, has been out the last two days, sick with the same wretched flu that laid Parris low for a week and a half).  Almost as many emails pouring in.  By rough count, at least 99% of the messages are generous, understanding, supportive, and heartening.\r\n\r\nThere's no way I can possibly answer all of them.  It's all I can do to read them.\r\n\r\nBut I do appreciate them, and I want every one to know that.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, please, have no fear, there was never any danger that I would be so discouraged by the comments of trolls, critics, and detractors that I would stop work on the book.  I am still pounding my head against that bloody keyboard daily.  Today it was in service of... ah, no, you're not supposed to know about that POV character yet.  (Though I have hinted).\r\n\r\nI also spent part of the day on email correspondence with a WARRIORS author about his story, talked to my editor and an artist about the ICE & FIRE concordance, traded some messages regarding developments on the HBO pilot, accepted an offer for that old issue of AMAZING I was looking for, paid my phone bill, and watched an episode of ER and one of MONK that I had TIVO'd earlier.  That's a pretty typical day, actually.  I work on DANCE, but not to the exclusion of all else.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.\r\n\r\nThe main point of this is just to say thanks.\r\n\r\nYes, there are some dolts and loonies out there.  But by and large, I have the best fans in the world.\r\n\r\n(And who knew so many of them were Rick Nelson fans?)","ditemid":75396,"eventtime":"2009-02-20 22:50:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":327,"taglist":"dance with dragons","current_moodid":125,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1250575199,"hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-02-21 06:03:33","anum":132,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html","event_timestamp":1235170200,"reply_count":186,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/78443026/4137153","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?replyto=5471876","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5471876#t5471876","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5471876#t5471876","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5471876#t5471876","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"chu_totoro","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://chu-totoro.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5471876,"talkid":21374,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5471876#t5471876","upictitle":"Fwoom: Chobits-- winz0rz","article":"keep going! best wishes and good luck on that book :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 21 2009, 06:05:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://chu-totoro.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"chu_totoro","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"chu_totoro","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://chu-totoro.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"chu_totoro","ctime_ts":1235196347,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/83147029/6412399","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?replyto=5506692","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5506692#t5506692","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5506692#t5506692","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5506692#t5506692","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"houdina","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://houdina.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5506692,"talkid":21510,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75396.html?thread=5506692#t5506692","above":5471876,"upictitle":"Mika: sunspots","article":"I have to admit to having been one of the loonies earlier this year.
