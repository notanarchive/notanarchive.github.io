{"itemid":258,"subject":"Guardians of Order RPG","event":"The pristine, undamaged copies of the Guardians of Order GAME OF THRONES rpg book are now all gone.  Sorry.\r\n\r\nI do still have some copies with minor water damage available at $55 plus shipping, and some with major water damage available at $20.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00025rhz/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00025rhz/s320x240\" width=\"185\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n((LATER))\r\n\r\nMy lady Parris has asked me to add the following addendum to this post:\r\n\r\n\"Although George's stock of the gorgeous Guardians of Order RPG limited  \r\nedition is now depleted, I still have a few copies.\r\n\r\nThose copies will be donated to charity auctions for good-deed-doing  \r\nover the next few years. Usually we donate an item or two to the  \r\ncharity auctions held at conventions we attend, or to on-line auctions  \r\nsuch as last year's \"Match It for Pratchett\" campaign.\r\n\r\nSo for those unhappy collectors who weren't able to get a copy before  \r\nGeorge sold out, there's still hope you can get one in the coming  \r\nyears, if you attend a convention we're at, or you see that I've  \r\ndonated one to an on-line auction. An added bonus will be helping out  \r\nwith a good cause as well as getting a copy of this incredible book.\"\r\n\r\n                                                       Parris","ditemid":66265,"eventtime":"2009-01-05 12:55:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":200,"opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":64,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1231201361},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-01-05 19:58:01","anum":217,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66265.html","event_timestamp":1231160100,"reply_count":0}
