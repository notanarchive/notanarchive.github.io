{"itemid":841,"subject":"22 and Counting","event":"No, not me.  (I wish).  Wild Cards.\r\n\r\nI'm pleased to announce that I've just signed contracts with Tor Books for another volume in our long-running Wild Cards series of shared world anthologies and mosaic novels.\r\n\r\nThis will be the twenty-second volume in the overall series, which debuted in 1987.  Wild Cards has outlasted all of the other shared world series of the 80s and 90s, and given rise to games, comics, television and film options, and other spinoffs.  Over the years, our contributors have included such stars of SF, fantasy, comics, and television as Roger Zelazny, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Walter Jon Williams, Howard Waldrop, Chris Claremont, Paul Cornell, Cherie Priest, Carrie Vaughn, Daniel Abraham, Stephen Leigh, S.L. Farrell, and many many more.\r\n\r\nOur working title for this one is LOWBALL.  It will be a direct sequel to volume twenty-one, FORT FREAK (due out next month), chronicling the further adventures of the cops and criminals of New York City's historic Jokertown precinct, Fort Freak.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to know more about the Wild Cards series, check out these to excellent fan sites:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wildcardsonline.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://captaincomics.ning.com/group/wildcards#\r\n\r\nYou can also begin at the beginning by picking up Tor's trade paperback reprint of the very first volume in the series, WILD CARDS, available on Amazon or at your favorite local bookshop.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dar46/\"><img
