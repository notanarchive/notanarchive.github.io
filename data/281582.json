{"itemid":1099,"subject":"Back from Montana","event":"Back home again from Missoula, Montana, where I spent the weekend as GOH at Miscon 26.\r\n\r\n'twas my first trip to Montana, and I can't say I really saw much of it, but Missoula was a pleasant little city, and the con itself was great.  They drew 1300 people, I'm told, a record for Miscon, and I think all of them had a great time.  I know I did.  Miscon fen party like we did in the old days, and the hotel -- Ruby's, a small indy with local ownership -- was really great.  None of the nonsense with noise complaints and shutting down parties and elevators that has plagued so many cons of late.  In fact, some of the hotel management partied with us.\r\n\r\nSo a tip of the hat to Justin, Cthulhu Bob, Clay, and the rest of the Miscon Miscreants, and to Tim, Dustan, and Vicky from Ruby's.  You were great.","ditemid":281582,"eventtime":"2012-05-30 11:09:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"travel, conventions","current_moodid":31,"commentalter":1339619932,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1340773772},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-05-30 17:10:59","anum":238,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html","event_timestamp":1338376140,"reply_count":43,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058350#t16058350","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058350#t16058350","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058350#t16058350","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"the_red_wedding","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://the-red-wedding.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16058350,"talkid":62727,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058350#t16058350","upictitle":"the_red_wedding: pic#0","article":"Loved the episode you wrote for the tv seiries ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"May 30 2012, 17:59:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Blackwater","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://the-red-wedding.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"the_red_wedding","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"the_red_wedding","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://the-red-wedding.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"the_red_wedding","ctime_ts":1338400743,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058606#t16058606","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058606#t16058606","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058606#t16058606","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058606#t16058606","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trilambdas","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trilambdas.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16058606,"talkid":62728,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16058606#t16058606","upictitle":"trilambdas: pic#0","article":"Welcome home George!

I'm \"forcing\" everyone I know to read A Song Of Ice And Fire, I get them hooked by giving them the first book as a present for their birthday and after that it's like a drug, they *need* to keep reading! :-) I also read some of your short SF stories and it's confirmed, I love your style, stories and characters. I do hope to meet you some day :-). Once again, thank you ^_^.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"May 31 2012, 09:51:12 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ysis.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ysis","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ysis","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ysis.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ysis","ctime_ts":1338457872,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/63236460/9336014","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16061934#t16061934","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16061934#t16061934","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16061934#t16061934","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"xraytheenforcer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://xraytheenforcer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16061934,"talkid":62741,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/281582.html?thread=16061934#t16061934","upictitle":"Xray Is As Xray Does: cocktail","article":"Welcome back.

It exceeded my own imagination at the point where they show off the CGI. (the deck vanishing from beneath a certain character's feet gave me the chills and left me on my knees looking for my jaw).<br />I had some questions around why Stannis was first out the boat and up the ladder, all without helmet, yet I feel I shouldn't ask. Wasn't critisism, but more questions directed toward Stannis from the books and if the series were \"cannon\" at all. I love the character Stannis in the books almost as much as I love Theon and Jaime, and this episode just made me love him even more. <br />That being said, you're a cruel man for getting me to invest in a character that's so thinly armoured against the other, more prominent characters (possibly a distant relative).<br /><br />Anyways, I saw this post, went to Miscon's website and noticed they'd planned a reading. I'm not so much a \"niggard\" as I'm far away from Montana (I live in Europe) and in the middle of my exams, so I couldn't be there. I was wondering if there is a way that we can hear/read the chapter you've read. <br /><br />Sorry for bothering you with the question and the lenghty post.<br />I'm very enthralled by your writing and I thank you for the many, many adventures you've given me.<br /><br />Edit: One last thing. A few of us in the bowels of internet, down in the dirty lower classes of forums, agreed that if you were ever to play a part in the HBO series, you should be one of the musicians at The Twins.
