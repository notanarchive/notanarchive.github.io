The ASoI&F series is published by Bantam Spectra in the USA, and Harper CollinsUK. The rights to publication vary from country to country, and agreements with the companies that offer e-books in various countries and formats/machines can be complex.<br /><br />The publishers of the two very different series - ASoI&F are George's solo works, the WILD CARDS series has been publishing since the mid-80's with almost 30 separate contributors in the series - have different publication plans and rights. George is one of the founders/writers and has always been the editor of the series since WILD CARDS began - (with help from Melinda Snodgrass, who recently sold a WILD CARDS script to SYFY's movie division) - the publishers do not work in tandem on international rights sales or co-ordinate releases of the two different series.<br /><br />I understand your frustration - I've wanted to buy books that were not available in the USA for one reason or another - and while I could go into a bookstore in Melbourne to buy a physical copy of a guide to the Australian birds, I could order one on-line and have it delivered to my USA address, I couldn't, not even when I was logging in from a Melbourne ISP, buy the same book in an e-format for my iPad.<br /><br />My best - and unofficial - suggestion is you contact the publisher and ask when you'll see the WILD CARDS books available in your region. You could also order the USA <i>physical</i> hardback or paperback editions from an on-line store, but if you live in the Asia/Pacific region, the shipping would be expensive.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"November 2 2011, 11:20:09 UTC","parent":14891236,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Kindle format not available in the Asia/Pacific region :(","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"parrismcb","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"parrismcb","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://parrismcb.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"November 2 2011, 11:27:23 UTC","dname":"parrismcb","ctime_ts":1320232809,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114109821/43627878","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245732.html?thread=14905828#t14905828","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245732.html?thread=14905828#t14905828","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245732.html?thread=14905828#t14905828","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_863606","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/pjwhyman","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14905828,"talkid":58225,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/245732.html?thread=14905828#t14905828","above":14904548,"upictitle":"Philip Berghan-Whyman: pic#114109821","article":"Thanks very much for the well thought out reply.
