{"itemid":1824,"subject":"Wild Cards Weekend","event":"No, no, not my Wild Cards books... NFL football.\r\n\r\nAll four road teams won.  So much for home field advantage.\r\n\r\n\"Life is miserable and full of pain,\" I often say, when the Giants and the Jets go down to defeat.  But I have to say, this weekend's games put my own miseries into proportion.  Yes, yes, the Jets have breaking my heart since 1969... but at least I am not a Vikings or a Bengals fan.  (Though I have friends who are both.  Hi, Mike.  Hi, Steve).  In all my years of watching football, I don't think I have ever seen two such agonizing losses.  If they had happened to one of my teams, I'd... I'd... god, I don't know what I'd do.  Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\r\n\r\nNext week it's on to the divisonal round.  Someone please beat the Patriots and I will be happy.","ditemid":467100,"eventtime":"2016-01-10 23:28:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jan 11 06:28:50 2016]R [Mon Jan 11 06:28:54 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/686434582179127296 ","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1452725285,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/686434582179127296","picture_keyword":"scotland","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.687362147142399]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1452493785}","revtime":1452725338},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-11 06:28:48","anum":156,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html","event_timestamp":1452468480,"reply_count":59,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126263383/72761182","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857308#t23857308","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857308#t23857308","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857308#t23857308","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"fka","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://fka.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23857308,"talkid":93192,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857308#t23857308","upictitle":"f k a: FIRE","article":"i completely agree!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 11 2016, 06:34:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://fka.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"fka","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"fka","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://fka.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"fka","ctime_ts":1452494092,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125878916/77259760","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23863452#t23863452","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23863452#t23863452","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23863452#t23863452","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"writing_mombie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23863452,"talkid":93216,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23863452#t23863452","above":23857308,"upictitle":"Writing_Mombie: turtle","article":"Each time I see your profile \"gif\", I wanna dance :P","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 11 2016, 15:06:18 UTC","parent":23857308,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"writing_mombie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"writing_mombie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"writing_mombie","ctime_ts":1452524778,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857564#t23857564","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857564#t23857564","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857564#t23857564","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3468742","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/106399987502746499875","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23857564,"talkid":93193,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23857564#t23857564","upictitle":"Zack Luye: pic#0","article":"This was a dark and painful day.

While I feel bad for the Vikings, (especially that Kicker, I hope he doesn't go on the internet ever again); I cannot bring myself to feel sorry for the Bengals. They earned that loss, that hit on Brown was insanity, Jones couldn't maintain composure, and Marvin Lewis did not have control of his team. The Steelers' had bad hits on Bengals as well, and their coaching staff was apparently provoking the Bengals throughout the contest, but the Bengals could not keep it under control. Still though, I hope that Denver goes ahead and knocks the battered Steelers out of the playoffs, because they don't deserve to be there either.<br /><br />As for the Chiefs and your favorite team to hate, George, it really could go either way. I'm predicting a blowout for one side, It will either reestablish the Patriots' dominance and send them to the Super Bowl, or it will be more of the lukewarm effort we've been getting from the Patriots, and the Chiefs will capitalize.

Add to this the strong playoff experience of the visiting teams (Seattle, Pittsburgh, GB) vs home teams (Minnesota, Washington, Houston) and this was a clear possibility before the weekend started.<br /><br />Here's a stat: Previous playoff experience of the visiting team starting QBs: 37 starts. Of home team starting QBs: 0 starts. Zero! Neither Cousins, Bridgewater, McCarron or Hoyer had started a playoff game before. Compare this with Roethlisberger (15 starts) or Rodgers (11).<br /><br />Besides all that, the losses by Cincinnati and Minnesota were way too painful and undeserved.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"January 11 2016, 09:19:09 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Visiting teams","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/burillo","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Pep Burillo","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2961888","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73915708&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Pep Burillo","ctime_ts":1452503949,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23860636#t23860636","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23860636#t23860636","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23860636#t23860636","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"northofboston","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://northofboston.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23860636,"talkid":93205,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/467100.html?thread=23860636#t23860636","upictitle":"jon: pic#0","article":"Might do you some good to enjoy the run of excellence the Patriots have had on the field instead of letting it upset you.

Take Blair off the team and Minnesota would have 0 points on the board. According to the announcers this was the first field goal he missed all season.
