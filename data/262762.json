But, way later in the book I found myself bawling my eyes out! I was just curious to know.....WHY DID YOU HAVE TO KILL HIM??? I mean, he was such a badass, not to mention a main character that seemed to hold the book together, and died in such a terribly sad way. You should have sent him to the wall or something! Don't get me wrong, I will still continue reading your books because they are completely amazing....but ever since he died...a part of me died with him while a kept reading. :(<br />I miss him! I really really hope that he will make an appearance near the end of the series explaining some elaborate stunt to get out of being beheaded....but I can just keep dreaming, haha. Anyway, I was just wondering if there was any particular reason to kill him off, or if you were just spicing up the book giving people a clear message that you will NEVER truly know what's going to happen. I don't know, I've just never been so broken hearted in my life to see(read) one of my favorite fictional characters of all time die like that. But you have seriously created the most captivating, amazing, brilliant, most in depth series I have ever read. I have never put myself completely into another world like I have with these books. I am highly impressed and am proud to call you my favorite author of all time. I hope you continue writing for years to come! Well anyway I know you have better things to do than read some random persons rambling message, but I do hope that maybe sometime you could honor me with a reply. :)<br /><br />Keep up the awesome work!<br />    - Haylee Moran of Sandpoint, Idaho ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"January 30 2012, 03:57:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Unrelated, but curious....","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/GrimmRipperr","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Haylee Moran","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1014677","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=45892529&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Haylee Moran","ctime_ts":1327895823,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/36024563/8482906","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262762.html?thread=15346282#t15346282","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262762.html?thread=15346282#t15346282","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262762.html?thread=15346282#t15346282","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lastalda","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lastalda.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15346282,"talkid":59946,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/262762.html?thread=15346282#t15346282","above":15341162,"upictitle":"lastalda: doll","article":"As an avid reader of these books, myself, I very much liked this particular death (though it did, indeed, hurt, and he was a great character).
