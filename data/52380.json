{"itemid":204,"subject":"Zombies","event":"There's a new anthology just out with an old story of mine.  It's called THE LIVING DEAD, and it includes \"Meathouse Man.\"  Just thought I'd mention it for all you necrophiliacs out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00014dze/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00014dze/s320x240\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nIf you've previously purchased DREAMSONGS or GRRM: A RRETROSPECTIVE (which are the same book), you've already read \"Meathouse Man.\"  If you haven't, well... I probably ought to warn you that it's the darkest, nastiest, most despairing story that I ever wrote.\r\n\r\nLots of classic zombie stories in the book, though.
