R. Martin is not your bitch\", this was all the more delightful to watch.  One cannot rush art of any kind, and I know all too well how it can take on a life of its own when you try to bring it out of your mind and into tangible form.<br /><br />I add my voice to the chorus:  while I am eager to read Winds of Winter, I want it when it's ready.  I want to read a new installment of your amazing series that is as well-woven, captivating and nuanced as its forebears.  We have become a society too accustomed to instant gratification, with little patience for the time required to craft anything with quality and attention to detail.<br /><br />As for those who worry about the series' production catching up with the published material, whether they be fans or HBO executives, I think they should try to relax.  Given the pattern that production has taken so far, any reasonable person can easily guess that it will require three, possibly four more seasons of the show to cover the remainder of Storm of Swords and all of the material in Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons.  That is more time than they realize when a writer's process is flowing steadily and strong.<br /><br />So keep in good humor, and remember that for ever complainer, there are likely ten other fans who are willing to wait patiently for the story to be ready on your terms.<br /><br />Thank you for all that you do.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"July 30 2013, 23:03:59 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ladyeternal.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ladyeternal","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ladyeternal","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ladyeternal.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ladyeternal","ctime_ts":1375225439,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121398438/1788323","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/331392.html?thread=18057856#t18057856","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/331392.html?thread=18057856#t18057856","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/331392.html?thread=18057856#t18057856","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wouldyoueva","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wouldyoueva.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18057856,"talkid":70538,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/331392.html?thread=18057856#t18057856","upictitle":"Eva Whitley: pic#121398438","article":"Funny, funny, funny on a day I needed a good laugh.
