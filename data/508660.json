{"itemid":1986,"subject":"South of the Border","event":"Strange to say, although I have lived in New Mexico since 1979, I have never really visited Old Mexico.  Oh, I attended a Westercon in El Paso a few years back, and spent an afternoon in Juarez with some other fans and writers.   And I spent a few hours in Tijuana back in the late 80s, I believe, while attending Comicon in San Diego.  But that hardly counts.  There's a lot more to Mexico than the border towns.\r\n\r\nMy first <b>real</b> visit to Mexico starts tomorrow, when I jet down to Guadalajara for the Guadalajara International Book Fair:  https://www.fil.com.mx/ingles/i_info/i_info_fil.asp\r\n\r\nI'm one of the guests at the conference.   I'll be doing interviews, a press conference, a live streaming event, and a signing.   I expect I will be doing some tequila tasting as well.  I am informed that Guadalajara is the tequila capital of Mexico.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to meeting my Mexican publishers, editors, and fans.\r\n\r\nThis is my last scheduled event for 2016.  My appearance schedule for 2017 is very limited, and will remain so until WINDS is completed.  So if you want to meet me or get a book signed, this will be the last chance for a good few months...\r\n\r\nSee you south of the border.","ditemid":508660,"eventtime":"2016-11-28 14:55:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"travels, conventions, signings","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Nov 28 21:55:26 2016]R [Mon Nov 28 21:55:27 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/803356657057034240 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1480964614,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/803356657057034240","picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.60159988003577]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1480370125}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1986?v=1480966513","revtime":1480966513},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-28 21:55:25","anum":244,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508660.html","event_timestamp":1480344900,"reply_count":69,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120142958/51623257","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508660.html?thread=25324788#t25324788","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508660.html?thread=25324788#t25324788","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508660.html?thread=25324788#t25324788","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508660.html?thread=25324788#t25324788","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sourbillytipton","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sourbillytipton.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25324788,"talkid":98924,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/508660.html?thread=25324788#t25324788","upictitle":"sourbillytipton: pic#120142958","article":"What are the chances of you staying in Mexico during the construction of Trump's wall/fence?
