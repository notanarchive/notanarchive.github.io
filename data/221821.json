{"itemid":866,"subject":"In Nidzica","event":"The convention has been a great time.  Though on Friday night Ty and I both drank way too muich vodka, which made our visit to Marbork castle yesterday more of an ordeal than it was meant to be.  The castle was very impressive, though I don't think Ty is going to remember any of it.\r\n\r\nToday we take off for Poznan and the next stage of our Polish visit.\r\n\r\nSomething seems amiss with my computer at home.  When I hook up to it, via the internet, it tells me that I haven't received any emails in three days, which I find extremely unlikely.  SO if you have been trying to email me recently, I haven't gotten more message.  Maybe Ty will be able to get it going later today.\r\n\r\nTill then, this Live Journal seems my only contact with the outside world.  (We did buy a Polish sim for our cellphone, but haven't been able to get that working either).","ditemid":221821,"eventtime":"2011-06-18 23:01:00","props":{"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1308542945,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","opt_lockcomments":1,"revtime":1308544137},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-06-19 05:01:50","anum":125,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221821.html","event_timestamp":1308438060,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221821.html?thread=13841533#t13841533","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221821.html?thread=13841533#t13841533","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221821.html?thread=13841533#t13841533","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"level1paladin","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://level1paladin.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13841533,"talkid":54068,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/221821.html?thread=13841533#t13841533","article":"Drink some Krupnik George!
