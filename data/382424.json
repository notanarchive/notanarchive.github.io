Paradoxically, I don't think the difficult roles [to cast] are the romantic leads -- this is the territory of, say, Colin Farrell, or Yvonne Strahovski, what have you -- rather, the core and mood and tempo of the story center round young Gaston.  We have relatively few snarky-young-Broderick analogs in the current Hollywood roster, but I guess Zach Eisenberg or (a heavily-medicated) Shia LaBeouf could do it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"September 5 2014, 16:01:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://stillking.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"stillking","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"stillking","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://stillking.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"stillking","ctime_ts":1409932905,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119933235/59768448","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/382424.html?thread=19506648#t19506648","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/382424.html?thread=19506648#t19506648","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/382424.html?thread=19506648#t19506648","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1613591","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/dorian.kratsas","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19506648,"talkid":76197,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/382424.html?thread=19506648#t19506648","upictitle":"Dorian Kratsas: pic#119933235","article":"Ladyhawke is my favorite fantasy movie of all time.

I would love to see the film with a new soundtrack - or maybe the score not \"light-rockified\" so much. That may be heretical to the movie's fans, but they did release a version of \"Legend\" with the original Goldsmith soundtrack (although I liked the Tangerine Dream soundtrack too), so why not release a new version of \"Ladyhawke\" with both versions as well?
