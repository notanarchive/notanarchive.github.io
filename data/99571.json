{"itemid":388,"subject":"Michael the Eagle","event":"And yes, Virginia, there are other things going on in the world besides the HBO pilot.\r\n\r\nLike the NFL.\r\n\r\nSo the Eagles have signed Michael Vick.  OK.  I'm glad it was not the Giants or the Jets, truthfully... though I do believe in second chances, and Vick has served his time.  Even so, I wouldn't want him on my team.  If his skills have not eroded too badly in prison, he will be a dangerous weapon for the Eagles, and my Giants have to face them twice... and sometimes three times... a year.  So this clearly makes the Birds the favorites in the NFC East.\r\n\r\nFine with me.

(and a step backward in selling pot, which I don't have any issues w/at all) <br /><br />Let's look at types of moral void in different crimes --<br /><br />Drive by shooting of someone you don't know or who you do know is innocent of any serious wrong-doing-- Somehow, you didn't think about what the impact of what you were doing on someone else, or didn't care.  Moral void of a sort, here.  But, you still don't actually have to *see* the consequences of what you did, so there's some possibility even tho you don't get it, you can get it and one day might.<br /><br />Torturing someone  (and assuming that person didn't just kill your best friend or something), or killing them slowly up close and personal -- Much huger moral void; you are right there sitting through the consequences and continuing to do them.  Vick was doing this when he put the dogs through the fights, and when he beat them, sometimes to death, for not fighting the way he wanted.  Or when he watched his friends do this.  <br /><br />Torturing and killing over and over and over again -- This is Vick.  He was there, he saw what the consequences of his actions were; he had time to think or feel.  It made no impact on him at all.  He had a whole bunch of second and even 100th chances to see and feel and think about the torture he was inflicting on innocents, and he still kept getting off on him.  To use an asoiaf reference, he deserves another chance about as much as Gregor Clegane or the Bloody Mummers.<br /><br />I was pulling for the Eagles to win the super bowl, because I'd like to see Donovan McNabb get one.  Now, I hope they lose every game.  What else I hope I shall not say, cause y'all will probably think that involves a moral void on my part.  Let's just say I believe in vengeance and wish I believed in karma.  Karma, please show up.  =)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 15 2009, 17:48:58
