Further research showed me that the original Black Pearl was one of Aegon IV's lovers and Aegon IV lived long after the time of the Dance.

I was curious whether it's normal in your writing process to go through so many editions of a POV chapter? From what I understand, you had several chapters from A DANCE WITH DRAGONS that were written and re-written many times over, and one in particular (trying to stay as spoiler-free as possible) that you chose to forego after several attempts to write it. Is this a normal process for you in writing? Have you discovered similar struggles in writing some of the chapters for THE WINDS OF WINTER? Regardless, thank you so much for releasing this chapter and writing a great set of books!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"March 27 2014, 23:46:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Writing Process","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bryndenbfish.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bryndenbfish","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bryndenbfish","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bryndenbfish.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bryndenbfish","ctime_ts":1395963993,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362384.html?thread=18866832#t18866832","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362384.html?thread=18866832#t18866832","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362384.html?thread=18866832#t18866832","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362384.html?thread=18866832#t18866832","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18866832,"talkid":73698,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/362384.html?thread=18866832#t18866832","above":18863248,"upictitle":"George R.R.
