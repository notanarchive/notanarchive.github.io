I got to see you on a panel at Marcon a few years back, which was awesome, but that's not why I'm leaving this. I'm a public librarian working in Outreach; we provide books and other materials to patrons who can't make it into the library. Most of our patrons are older and can only read large print. I'm wondering if you have any information on whether your Song of Ice and Fire books will be made available in large print at any time (I know they'd be massive, but we've had some pretty hefty books in that format). Many of our older readers would love to read you but can't deal with the small print in the books. I've been giving the audiobooks to our patrons who can listen to them, but I'd love to be able to share your books in print as well. Thanks for reading!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"February 3 2012, 16:21:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Large Print?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wishesofastar.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wishesofastar","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wishesofastar","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wishesofastar.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wishesofastar","ctime_ts":1328286112,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115659984/45467845","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/263273.html?thread=15363689#t15363689","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/263273.html?thread=15363689#t15363689","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/263273.html?thread=15363689#t15363689","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"fl0wer666","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://fl0wer666.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15363689,"talkid":60014,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/263273.html?thread=15363689#t15363689","upictitle":"fl0wer666: pic#115659984","article":"It is a wonderful idea. My mum is currently 78, her English is excellent (as contrasted with mine )-:) and she has been reading the series in original since the day she first encountered the “Blood of the Dragon“ novel somewhere back in the distant year of 1999. She recently went through 2 cataract operations but it doesn’t help too much.   She is still reading a lot but the process is slower and I do not know how to say that but large print I am sure will bring her back the joy of reading ASOIAF books already written and those  we are all waiting for.
