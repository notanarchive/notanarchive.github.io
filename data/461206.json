{"itemid":1801,"subject":"Puppies at Christmas","event":"It's Christmas Eve.  Time for my ritual screening of my favorite adaptations of A CHRISTMAS CAROL... the Reginald Owen version, the Alastair Sim version, the George C. Scott version, and... best of all... BLACKADDER'S CHRISTMAS CAROL, with Rowan Atkinson.  Time for eggnog.  Time for wrapping prezzies.  Time for peace on earth, and good will toward men... and women... and aliens... and elves... and even puppies.  So in the spirit of the season, I am going to say something nice about the Sad Puppies.\r\n\r\nLast year's Puppygate was an ugly affair.  I am not going to rehash it here.  My views are all on record, my original blog posts still up for anyone who wants to go back and read them.  The last thing I want... the last thing anyone who truly loves science fiction, fantasy, and fandom would want... would be to have to go through the whole thing again in 2016.  Whatever your view of how the Hugo Awards turned out at Sasquan, I think we can all agree that we would like MidAmericon II's awards to be more joyful, less rancorous, less controversial.  \r\n\r\nAnd maybe... just maybe... we'll get our wish.  Call me naive.  Call me an innocent.  Call me too trusting by half, too nice a guy to see how things really are... but, really, I am starting to have some hope.  All over the internet, people are already talking about the Hugo Awards, making recommendations, discussing the work... the WORK, the things we love, the stuff that unites us instead of the stuff that divides us.  I've been trying to do my part, here on my Not A Blog, and will continue to do so.  Over at FILE 770, similar discussions are taking place.  And on many other websites, blogs, and bulletin boards as well... including Sad Puppies 4.\r\n\r\nYes, the Sad Puppies are doing it again.  ((No big secret, that was announced even before worldcon)).  Discussions of possible nominations in all Hugo categories can be found on their SP4 site here:  http://sadpuppies4.org/sp4-recommendations-pages-and-faq/   Go check it out.  You can even join in.  So far as I can tell, you don't need to be a Puppy to recommend.\r\n\r\nAs of a few minutes ago, there were 159 'thoughts' in the Best Novel section, which suggests a healthy level of participation.  And, I am pleased to say, almost all of what follows seems to be honest and enthusiastic discussion of the work.  I am seeing very little name-calling compared to what we saw in Sad Puppies 3, a dearth of references to CHORFS and ASPs and Puppy-kickers and that perennial favorite, SJWs.  I am not seeing any \"nominate this, it will make their heads explode\" posts that we saw so often last year.  \r\n\r\nInstead, people are recommending books.  A very wide range of books.  Sure, new works by familiar Puppy favorites like Larry Correia, Mike Williamson, and John C. Wright are being recommended (no surprise there)... but so are works by Neal Stephenson, James S.A. Corey, Naomi Novik, Victor Milan, Terry Pratchett, S.M. Stirling, Ian Tregillis, Ernie Cline, Elizabeth Bear, Gene Wolfe, Michael Moorcock, Orson Scott Card, Greg Bear, Kate Elliott, and many others... including the latest Marko Kloos, and... wonder of wonder... novels from N.K. Jemisin and Anne Leckie!\r\n \r\nThere are some really good names on that list.  Some really good books.  (And many I have not read yet, but will look up now).  And there's an amazing <i><b>range</b></i> of literary styles, subgenres, and... yes... political and religious views.  And all this is to the good.\r\n\r\n(Similar discussions are taking place on Sad Puppies 4 for the other categories, though Best Novel has the most participation).\r\n\r\n For decades now, LOCUS and NESFA and other fan groups have produced reading lists at year's end, long lists generated by recommendations from their editors/ members/ etc.  If at the end of this process, Sad Puppies 4 puts forth a similar list, one that has room for <i><b>BOTH</b></i> Larry Correia and Anne Leckie, I don't think anyone could possibly object.  I won't, certainly.  A list like that would not be a slate, and the whole \"slate voting\" thing will become moot.\r\n\r\n And that would be great.  That would mean no Puppygate II.  That would mean a spirited <i><b>literary</b></i> debate about writers and books without the acrimony and the name-calling.  From that debate a truly democratic and diverse ballot could emerge, one that represents all tastes.  That would mean no <i><b>'No Awards</b></i>' at Big MAC II, and the Hugo ceremony could once again become a joyous celebration of the best and brightest in our field. \r\n\r\n In my post-worldcon blog post last August 31 (( http://grrm.livejournal.com/440444.html )) I expressed the hope that the ugliness of 2015 could be left behind, that Fandom and Puppydom could coexist in peace.   That's still my hope.  And right now I am feeling a little more hopeful than I was in August.  People are talking books, not trading epithets... \r\n\r\n Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good read.","ditemid":461206,"eventtime":"2015-12-24 18:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, puppygate","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Dec 25 01:10:48 2015]R [Fri Dec 25 01:10:50 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/680193953774186496 ","current_moodid":43,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1451258947,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/680193953774186496","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.641487202504974]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451005907}","revtime":1451258982},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-25 01:10:47","anum":150,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html","event_timestamp":1450980660,"reply_count":40,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125709625/77221042","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23312022#t23312022","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23312022#t23312022","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23312022#t23312022","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3443285","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Enrique_swaggy","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23312022,"talkid":91062,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23312022#t23312022","upictitle":"Enrique Limn: pic#125709625","article":"The Winter is Here martin I love your job in your books (all not only Song of Ice and Fire...Greetings for you and your wife<br /><br />~Isaac L.L Henry~ \"THE Unknow writer<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 25 2015, 01:20:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Merry Christmas","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Enrique_swaggy","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Enrique_swaggy","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3443285","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77221042&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Enrique_swaggy","ctime_ts":1451006421,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23313046#t23313046","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23313046#t23313046","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23313046#t23313046","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3443295","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/101278675725610032025","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23313046,"talkid":91066,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461206.html?thread=23313046#t23313046","upictitle":"Uma D: pic#0","article":"Hope...will get TWOW in new year.

TIjuana","article":"I was hoping to get through Christmas without having to see stuff about the Puppies, but I didn't see this until the 26th, so I guess that part is okay.<br /><br />Based on the pattern from 2015, we know the voting system itself works fine, it's nominations where the wannabe gatekeepers have undue influence. We know the nomination rules have not yet changed. We know the Puppies are organizing again for 2016. Based on last year, we know that Correia, Torgenson, and Beale are aware of the January 31 deadline for becoming a member eligible to nominate. We know that all the members of Sasquan are eligible to nominate in 2016; this includes the 370 or so Puppies who purchased supporting memberships for Sasquan on January 26, which coincides with the 370 who nominated the slate(s) While that is a key number, we know the Puppies continued to mobilize people after April 4. We know that the total number of voters who voted for Puppies nominations above No Award in the final votes was around 2200. Not all of this number were Vile Faceless Minions (Vox Day's name for them), but overall the 2016 slate may have a large number of members submitting slate nominations. From the data availalbe, we know that almost all the January 26 Puppies members and most of the Puppies and specifically anti-Puppies voters after April 4 were supporting, not attending members. In other words, this activity comes from outside the Worldcon community. The Puppies had almost no presence at the convention and certainly this activity is not initiated by Wroldcon organizers in any way, though it does create extra work for a few departments. Beale perceives this as a conflict between himself and Scalzi and the Nielsen Haydens, a conflict that existed before Beale and co. paid particular attention to the Hugos; the Hugos are just one battlefield in their conflict. From the nomination results, where there was a difference between the \"Sad\" and \"Rabid\" Puppies slates, we know that the \"Sad\" Puppies were essentially irrelevant, and from web analytics tracking responses (clicks from one website to another) to various events that there was no chronological difference in the behavior of Sad and Rabid Puppies; they moved as one. Specifically we know that Larry Correia's followers generally ignored the \"Sad\" Puppies version and nominated off the \"Rabid\" Puppies list. In other words, we can conclude from the evidence the \"Sad\" Puppies are just a cover and a propaganda wing; Puppies are one movement, driven by Beale. the Puppies have some new figurehead for 2016, I don't recall the name, but the fact that they have a \"leader\" without a transparent selection process indicates that someone is selecting the leader, and that person is the one driving the strategy.<br /><br />Those of us who consider the Hugo Awards to be a useful contribution to the science fiction community will encourage everyone interested to nominate works they like next year, as we do every year. Democracy will prevail.

No credentials! I voted after a LiveJournal appeal from grrm, who in addition to Max Headroom and THE ARMAGEDDON RAG wrote a series of epic fantasy novels that got adapted into a cable show.”<br /><br />“Wires transmitting radio signals, right? LiveJournal’s better than Facebook. But gramps, what’s a series of epic fantasy novels?”<br /><br />“As the Big Five collapsed, earnings… let’s not talk about that. Fandom splintered into fractious online subgroups, and mega-authors had to choose between positioning themselves as a mega-brand in thrall to some corporation, or as a mega-fan, exemplar of the imagined community spanning the sequestered subcultures.\" <br /><br />“Sounds like a rhetorical tightrope.”<br /><br />“It was tough on authors who spent decades in the fandom of printed books – like Pournelle’s 18-volume THERE WILL BE WAR you got for Christmas.”<br /><br />“Are those Man-Kzin stories canonical?”<br /><br />“Absolutely. Look. We were spread so thin that finalists in Best Novella, Novelette or Short Story were thrown out because they didn’t meet the threshold of five percent of nominating ballots cast.”<br /><br />“What determined eligibility, gramps?”<br /><br />“Word count.”<br /><br />“You’re old! Why didn’t the mega-fans like grrm and Liu Cixin and Rudy Rucker just plug in their wires and explain to all fans of text-based, linear, narrative, non-interactive science fiction that they needed to pull together, honor its practitioners and save a dying art form? I mean, you and grandma made me this set of THERE WILL BE WAR from hand grown, scudded, pounced, and bound calfskin.”<br /><br />“Rucker did. Liu Cixin was torn between Arthur C. Clarke and the MMOG future, and he imagined – wrongly, as we now know – that Anglosphere fans could repair the Hugos on their own. grrm made a few human mistakes, but he did his best and – thank Ghu! – in the end, everybody started pulling together.”<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 27 2015, 07:30:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The Day after Christmas, 2065","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://brianz2017.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"brianz2017","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"brianz2017","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://brianz2017.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"December 27 2015, 10:02:14 UTC","dname":"brianz2017","ctime_ts":1451201451,"tracked":0}]}
