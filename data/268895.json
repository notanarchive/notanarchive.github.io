Big guys like the Mountain are obviously a little bigger, and small people like Arya and Tyrion are a little smaller.  If they're not 32mm, they're 28mm, which is a tiny bit smaller still.  Pretty sure they're 32mm though.<br /><br />They also have 54mm versions of Tyrion, the first Dany mini, and an incredible new(ish) Ser Loras that Tom Meier sculpted up in secret as a surprise for Mr. Martin which I am surprised not to have seen him post about here yet since it's been in Dark Sword's online store since mid-November and was announced in their newsletter back around the same time. Those ones should be almost twice the size of the 32mm minis; a little harder to swallow, but probably not completely impossible.  <br /><br />So yeah, definitely a choking hazard for small children, especially the ones that require assembly, since those come with extra swords, heads, shields, limbs, or what have you, which can occasionally fall off if they're not glued on that well or get bumped around too much.  Keep'em locked up or out of reach for sure as long as you have young children in your house.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, what Ice & Fire minis have you got in your display case, if you don't already know how big Dark Sword's Ice & Fire minis are?  Only similar products I know of are some larger busts that are way too big to choke on, plus a very few minis that were put out by Testors a few years back which can be quite hard to find.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"February 21 2012, 21:34:15 UTC","parent":15498079,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1329860055,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116037350/46576973","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498335#t15498335","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498335#t15498335","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498335#t15498335","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1055369","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ac2324","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15498335,"talkid":60540,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498335#t15498335","upictitle":"ac232: pic#116037350","article":"How about an unnamed miniature of a new point of a view character from the next book?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"February 19 2012, 16:35:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Future","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ac2324","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ac2324","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1055369","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=46576973&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ac2324","ctime_ts":1329669354,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115465119/45519565","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498847#t15498847","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498847#t15498847","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498847#t15498847","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"avidreader19701","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://avidreader19701.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15498847,"talkid":60542,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/268895.html?thread=15498847#t15498847","upictitle":"avidreader19701: pic#115465119","article":"No miniatures for me - I actually prefer larger action figures LOL!!  <br /><br />Ser Martin when can be look forward to more sword replicas????
