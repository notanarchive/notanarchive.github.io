{"itemid":597,"subject":"Requiem for a Queen","event":"Caught the fifth episode of the new season of THE TUDORS this evening.\r\n\r\nGiven my fascination with history and my love of historical fiction, it's probably no surprise to most of the regulars here to know that I've watched this Showtime series from the beginning, albeit with decidedly mixed feelings.\r\n\r\nThe show has great costumes, great sets, great visuals overall.  The storytelling has been rather uneven, though... the first season in particular was weak, I thought... and they do fudge about with history some... though I give them props for presenting the period in considerably more detail than any previous dramatization has done, with a lot of complexity and a rich cast of secondary players.  You know how I love that stuff.\r\n\r\nThe thing I mostly DON'T like is the lead.  Henry VIII is the heart of the series, of course, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has played him start to finish as the Shouting Studmuffin, with nary an inch of depth or understanding.  Worst Henry ever.  (See Keith Michell's portrayal in the classic BBC miniseries if you'd like a look at how it should be done).\r\n\r\nIf you can manage to ignore Rhys-Meyers, however, there has been some wonderful acting in the series, especially by the actresses playing Henry's wives.  Natalie Dormer was especially outstanding in her portrayal of Anne Boleyn, perhaps my favorite Anne of all the actresses who have played the part over the years.  The actresses who played Katherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour, and Anne of Cleves were also very good.\r\n\r\nAnd in this evening's epiosde, the beautiful and talented Tamzin Merchant's wonderful portrayal as the doomed teenage queen Katheryn Howard came to its bloody conclusion on the headsman's block, in a scene as gut-wrenching and heart-breaking as Anne Boleyn's execution a couple of seasons back.  Tamzin took on a daunting task with this role.  Katheryn was the youngest of Henry's queens, only fifteen by some accounts (others say slightly older), and while far from innocent, she was naive, unsophisticated, frivilous, giggly.. a kitten frolicking in a tiger cage, oblivious to the claws around her.  Tamzin caught all that wonderfully, I thought... both in the character's introduction last season, and in the first few episodes of this seasons... sexy as hell in the bedroom scenes, a playful child with her friends and ladies, awkward and ill at ease at court.\r\n\r\nThis week, however, the mood changed abruptly, when all the sunlight went away, and Katheryn and her lovers and friends were swallowed by darkness.  Tamzin did all that beautifully as well, showing us Kathryn's fear and desperation, and, finally, her courage as she faced the axe.  My favorite scene, though, was a completely silent one, where Tamzin dances alone in a darkened abbey while her friends and lovers are being tortured and beheaded elsewhere, and we intercut between the two.  Exquisite.\r\n\r\nNext week THE TUDORS continues as they bring in Henry's sixth and final queen, Catherine Parr.  Unfortunately, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers will still be on hand, but I expect I will watch anyway, to see how the show comes out (I do wish the show was going to continue and gives us the reigns of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth.  Why call it THE TUDORS if the only Tudor we get is Henry, badly portrayed?)  But no matter how good the actress portraying Catherine Parr turns out to be, I know that Tamzin's beauty, grace, and talent will be missed.","ditemid":153015,"eventtime":"2010-05-10 00:34:00","props":{"taglist":"television","current_moodid":25,"commentalter":1375895135,"picture_keyword":"sadface","personifi_word_count":592,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:6,33:4,11:4,23:7,16:6,3:12,24:9,25:13,4:6,26:4,20:13,9:20,21:6,22:9,nterms:no","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-05-10 06:34:50","anum":183,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html","event_timestamp":1273451640,"reply_count":113,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?replyto=10029495","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10029495#t10029495","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10029495#t10029495","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10029495#t10029495","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10029495#t10029495","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mod4finil","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10029495,"talkid":39177,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10029495#t10029495","upictitle":"mod4finil: pic#0","article":"Hah, just kidding.

I've found the role of Katheryne has not been one that best shows Ms. Merchant's talents, especially as it would have applied to <em>Game of Thrones</em> -- she lacked the _fear_ that Dany has at the start of the novel, and growing maturity. But this was because of how her role was written, and I'm sure she acted the part to the fullest of the production's hopes. <br /><br />This episode sounds like it will show something that's akin to Dany. Yes, I'm looking forward to it. A shame that Ms. Merchant's not in the role any longer, but I can only hope that whichever young actress gets the part will be at least as good.<br /><br />One last remark on <em>The Tudors</em>: One of the best things about the show has been the costuming. It's stunning, and I see others agree: many award nominations, and an Emmy win a couple of years ago. I'm unsure what direction costuming is going on <em>Game of Thrones</em>, if they're going to give it all a bit of a more subdued, grimy kind of look (\"How do you know he's the king?\" \"He's the one not covered in shit.\"), or if they're going to highlight the luxury in which the nobility can live. But if the garments of the nobles are as rich as those in <em>The Tudors</em>, I for one will not complain.<br /><br />(That said, I hope <em>Game of Thrones</em> handles the armor rather (a lot) better, budget allowing. The jousting armor in previous seasons of <em>The Tudors</em> was laughably bad. My ideal is that we see as many people in full plate and mail, or full plate for the great and the powerful, as one saw in <em>Excalibur</em> 30 years ago. That's unlikely to happen on a TV budget -- even an HBO TV budget, I expect -- but that's my hope.)<br /><br />And now, for something completely different, I know <span  class=\"ljuser  i-ljuser  i-ljuser-deleted  i-ljuser-type-P     \"  data-ljuser=\"mod4finil\" lj:user=\"mod4finil\" ><a href=\"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/profile\"  target=\"_self\"  class=\"i-ljuser-profile\" ><img  class=\"i-ljuser-userhead\"  src=\"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10\" /></a><a href=\"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/\" class=\"i-ljuser-username\"   target=\"_self\"   ><b>mod4finil</b></a></span> was joking, but I bet you <em>will</em> get someone complaining about spoilers in all seriousness, much as people have complained re: \"spoilers\" for <em>The Pacific</em> (have you been watching it? what do you think? I find it better than <em>Band of Brothers</em> in a few ways, but the nature of the war in the Pacific and their choice of how to depict it has made the narrative very loose). <br /><br />You really ought to master lj cuts, just to save gripes about long posts or what have you in the future, as some have done (and rightfully, because the LJ Friends page is not very useful as far as navigating -- no way to hit a button to just skip to the next item). <br /><br />If you use the Rich Text Editor, all it takes is clicking that squiggly button at the head of spoilery/lengthy matter, or simply manually placing &lt;lj-cut text=\"Whatever I want to say about the cut\"&gt; there.

It's like seeing Tom Cruise play the part of any of the apostles during the Last Supper or something similarly silly. <br /><br />It breaks away any sense of belonging and when I find myself hating or disliking a character because I really can't find any merit in the way an actor is portraying the character, I tend to shy away from TV-shows or movies.<br /><br />I guess that is why I love most of the BBC shows when it comes to murder mysteries or shows that revolve around typical characters. They seem to know what casting a character for a role is really about. They hit the nail on the head with farmers, creepy people, sneaky people and yes... even ugly people. For all that its worth, they seem to be able to cast people for roles and not actors... if that makes any sense.<br /><br />On the topic of the Tudors, I'm afraid I haven't watched any of it... simply because the Henry character gave me the exact same feeling I described above somewhere. I saw an actor, looking like he was born in this age and the way he came across pushed me away from watching the show. That and the obnoxious commercial breaks they tend to throw around here in the Netherlands. For a country that is named like a fantasy realm... they certainly know how to bash the head of fantasy in with their commercial crap.<br /><br />I hope the next actress to step into the fray to portray the role of Queen will spark that feeling of respect and well acted character likeness that you found in the Tamzin actress. Perhaps when I get around to obtaining the DVD set sometime in the future, I'll give it a go... if only to remember what you said about the acting and see if I too get that feeling.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />MWW ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"May 10 2010, 09:27:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://greyshay.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"greyshay","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"greyshay","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://greyshay.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"greyshay","ctime_ts":1273483639,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110920179/22576607","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?replyto=10087351","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10087351#t10087351","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10087351#t10087351","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10087351#t10087351","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lampster65","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lampster65.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10087351,"talkid":39403,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html?thread=10087351#t10087351","above":10034103,"upictitle":"lampster65: Arya Valar Morghulis","article":"I remember those heady days when casting for Lord of the Rings was going on.

I have always felt her true role in the change of religions in Britain has been greatly under appreciated. The fact that she was a strong-willed smart and savvy lady, who had to be accused of being a whore in order to for her position to be taken away. They couldn't get her politically, so they had to resort to witchcraft and adultery, which to me tells me she must have held some weight for the men to use the age-old excuse when a woman isn't simpering and submissive. <br /><br />Anyway, this I'm probably sure you know since you're a history buff, too. I've just been horribly let down, time and time again, whenever someone portrays her. (<i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i> made me say a string of words that probably shouldn't be shouted in public) <i>The Tudors</i> is the first time I think that's actually come close to getting her personality right. Mind you, I didn't think they made her as strong in the religion department as she could have been, but at least her character was more than a woman withholding sex for power.<br /><br />I haven't seen past season 2, but I look forward to it. And, while he may have got the character off, from a straight female's perspective, If I'm going to watch sex scenes, the male lead better be hot.Unless it's some kind of joke or meant to make you squirm with horror. So I'm all okay with him staying studmuffin and not gross ulcer on his leg or syphilitic. That would have definitely made me change the channel.

I just barely got into the series, after years of dismissing it based on a couple scenes I had watched with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. I had hoped they would have at least replaced him with a more fitting Henry VIII as the series aged, considering the state he was supposed to be in by the end. I just finished the second season, and I'm glad to have been watching the series as Natalie Dormer's final episode really blew me away. They have some truly amazing things going on in there, and it's a shame that the lead is so \"meh\" all around.<br /><br />I was surprised to find out this was the final season of the show, ending with his sixth wife. I was really hoping that they'd go far enough to show Mary and possibly Elizabeth as queens.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"May 10 2010, 13:46:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://stealingbabies.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"stealingbabies","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"stealingbabies","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://stealingbabies.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"stealingbabies","ctime_ts":1273499197,"tracked":0}]}
