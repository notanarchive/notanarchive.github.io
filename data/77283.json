{"itemid":301,"subject":"Once More, the Calendars","event":"It's now March, and I think... hope... that we are almost done with the calendar business.\r\n\r\nLes Dabel has assured me that everyone who bought and paid for a calendar has now been sent one (some have been sent two, or even three, he says, in cases where the first one never arrived).  The international shipments may not yet have been delivered in all cases, overseas airmail being what it is, but all of them are on the way.\r\n\r\nThis leaves only the signed calendars.  And no, those have not yet arrived here for signing.  Let me say once again that the minute they turn up, I will post it here.\r\n\r\n(Let me also say, once again, that I will NOT be signing any 2010 calendars. Les, Ernst, please do not offer any 2010 signed versions, I do not want to go through this again)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002xe5s/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002xe5s/s320x240\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n(And that's March, FWIW.

This book is set in England, if that particular brand of Old World magic had really existed, but just died out. It's a dark faerie tale, not a sword and sorcery epic. But it's alternate history during the war with Napoleon but with magicians, what's not to like?<br /><br />I'm also going to throw <b><i>Lord of Light</i> by Roger Zelazny</b> out there, along with <b><i>The Anubis Gates</i> by Tim Powers</b>, and curiouser and curiouser? <b><i>Watership Down</i> by Richard Adams.</b><br />\"Watership Down is a remarkable tale of exile and survival, of heroism and leadership...the epic novel of a group of adventurers who desert their doomed city, and venture forth against all odds on a quest for a new home, a sturdier future...\"<br />What turns most people off is it's not about human beings but about rabbits. It's got the rabbit version of Nazi Germany though! Infiltrations, rescues, escapes, war and life and death.
