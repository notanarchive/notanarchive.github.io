{"itemid":2088,"subject":"California Dreamin'","event":"I am off to California tomorrow.\r\n\r\nFirst stop will be Long Beach, for Stokercon, the annual gathering of the Horror Writers Association and the presentation of the Bram Stoker Awards.  (That's the one that looks like a creepy house, as opposed to the new World Fantasy Award, which looks like a creepy tree).  This year's Stokercon will be on the Queen Mary, which I last visited for a Nebula Awards banquet in... ohmigod, could it really have been 1996?  Where do the years go?  (Thinking back, that must have been a few months before A GAME OF THRONES was published.  Little did I dream how much my life was about to change).\r\n\r\nI love old ocean liners (modern cruise ships not so much), so banqueting with my brothers and sisters in horror on the Queen should be a hoot and a half.\r\n\r\nAfter that, it's down to San Diego for a fundraising event for Clarion.  I'll be having a conversation with Kim Stanley Robinson.   <img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/459057/459057_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nAlas, I'm told the event is already sold out.  \r\n\r\nAnd, sorry, no, I will not be signing... just talking.","ditemid":534728,"eventtime":"2017-04-26 12:32:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"author events, awards, conventions","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1494039007,"give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.649136033402112]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1493231522}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2088?v=1493231517"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-04-26 18:31:56","anum":200,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534728.html","event_timestamp":1493209920,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124081839/72492018","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534728.html?replyto=26044616","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534728.html?thread=26044616#t26044616","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534728.html?thread=26044616#t26044616","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534728.html?thread=26044616#t26044616","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"missmatchedeyes","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://missmatchedeyes.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26044616,"talkid":101736,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/534728.html?thread=26044616#t26044616","upictitle":"missmatchedeyes: pic#124081839","article":"Have fun at Stokercon!

Fandom debated whether to go worldcon in Phoenix in 1978, because Arizona had not ratified the ERA (Harlan famously semi-boycotted by staying in a trailer).  Jimmy Carter took the US out of the 1979 Olympics in Russia because of Russian actions in Afghanistan.   There were questions as to whether American athletes should have gone to the '36 Olympics as well.   I could go on and on... so could you, I have no doubt...<br /><br />I have never seen any evidence that any of these actions are effective.   All Jimmy did was deny a lot of US athletes the chance to win medals; Russia's Afghanistan policy did not change.
