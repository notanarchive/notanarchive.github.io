{"itemid":1730,"subject":"Eight Is NOT Enough","event":"HBO and GAME OF THRONES dominated last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys in LA.\r\n\r\nHBO took home 29, way more than any other network.  GOT accounted for eight of those, more than any other show.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/275128/275128_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/275392/275392_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/275629/275629_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nAwards were given in every category.  For the full list of nominees and winners:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/creative-arts-emmys-2015-winners-822621\r\n\r\nThe rest of this year's Emmys will be given out this Sunday.  I'll be flying out to LA once more for the ceremony.  GAME OF THRONES is nominated for directing, writing, and acting... and of course, for Best Drama.  So cross your fingers, cross your toes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, congratulations to all of our Emmy winners from last week.  Well deserved!  A hearty round of applause, please... and for the losers too.  Not everyone can take home the trophy, but you all did great work.","ditemid":443028,"eventtime":"2015-09-15 17:09:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"emmy awards, awards, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1442879201,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Eight Is NOT Enough http://goo.gl/dPzhbn","picture_keyword":"enthroned","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.650233982124534]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1442358606}","revtime":1442879132},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-09-15 23:09:15","anum":148,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html","event_timestamp":1442336940,"reply_count":47,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22623124#t22623124","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22623124#t22623124","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22623124#t22623124","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"afw4402","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://afw4402.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22623124,"talkid":88371,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22623124#t22623124","upictitle":"Arthur Wahlberg: pic#0","article":"When I first read the title I thought you finished winds and realized that you would need more than 8 books to finish the series haha.

Congrats to you and to HBO on the well-earned awards!<br /><br />While we're on the subject of awards, I wanted to mention...  I just recently read your post on all the different SF awards (and others), and I kind of gawked when I got to the image you posted for the Saturn award.  I wasn't sure if you'd posted it as a joke or not.<br /><br />The Saturn is labeled as being awarded to L Ron Hubbard for \"Battlefield Earth\", which I thought was odd, since the movie was... well, let's say it was not well received and I didn't think it would win any awards (other than perhaps a Razzie).  And it would be even more odd if they awarded him a Saturn for the book, since it's a visual media award.<br /><br />I did a little quick research, googling \"Saturn Award Battlefield Earth\", and the only real hits I get are at battlefieldearth.com and lronhubbard.org.  I went to the Saturn Awards webpage and searched but found no evidence that Battlefield Earth had ever won a Saturn.  (I found references on wikipedia, but the listed source was the lronhubbard.org site.)<br /><br />I also noticed references in the same places to Hubbard winning \"Italy's Tetradramma D'Oro Award\", an award which I can find no mention of anywhere else...<br /><br />I've also not been able to find specifically what year and which category Battlefield Earth won.<br /><br />I guess I'm asking if you (or anyone else here) knows whether that image ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059<wbr />164/272673/272673_900.jpg ) is for real, or whether it's something that was made up to aggrandize Mr. Hubbard for a certain organization...<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"September 16 2015, 22:28:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Speaking of awards...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/107589516274365657755","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Greg Park","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3307542","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76813843&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Greg Park","ctime_ts":1442442501,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117796605/50627511","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22632852#t22632852","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22632852#t22632852","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22632852#t22632852","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22632852#t22632852","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1271338","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RaUL_AMDERLAINE","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22632852,"talkid":88409,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/443028.html?thread=22632852#t22632852","upictitle":"RaUL AMDERLAINE: pic#117796605","article":"Mr. Martin, when exactly did you first feel \"successful\"?
