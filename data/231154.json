{"itemid":902,"subject":"I'm Number Two...","event":"... this week, anyway.\r\n\r\nTalking NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list now.  Other lists may differ.\r\n\r\nBetween my book tour and the madness that is San Diego Comicon, I was too busy to post the requisite squeal of glee, but hey, better late than never.\r\n\r\nA DANCE WITH DRAGONS debuted at #1 on the NYTimes list the week it came out.  A \"very strong\" number one, my publishers tell me.  (Though no number #1 can truly be said to be weak).\r\n\r\nIt held on to to the top slot the following week, despite a strong challenge from a thriller author who normally debuts at #1.\r\n\r\nAnd yesterday, in its third week of release, DANCE slipped to the second spot, shoved aside by the new Harry Dresden novel from Jim Butcher.\r\n\r\nI am also told that DANCE sold 298,000 copies on its first day of release, the biggest first day sale for any work of fiction released in 2011.\r\n\r\n((And all this is just in the US.  DANCE has been doing awfully well in the UK as well)).\r\n\r\nSo... all is good.\r\n\r\nMy thanks go out to all of you, my fans and readers, for your enthusiasm and support.  It's in no small part thanks to you spreading the word that DANCE has achieved these record sales.  There's no substitute for good word of mouth.  ((THough having a hit series on HBO does not hurt either.  Thanks, guys)).","ditemid":231154,"eventtime":"2011-08-05 15:14:00","props":{"taglist":"a dance with dragons","current_moodid":21,"commentalter":1312923485,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1312996079},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-08-05 21:14:50","anum":242,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231154.html","event_timestamp":1312557240,"reply_count":67,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120310462/2693101","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231154.html?thread=14414834#t14414834","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231154.html?thread=14414834#t14414834","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231154.html?thread=14414834#t14414834","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cat_o_wen","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cat-o-wen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14414834,"talkid":56307,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231154.html?thread=14414834#t14414834","upictitle":"Cat: Crown on blonde queen","article":"Congrats on being <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a> as you truly deserved it!
