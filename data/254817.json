{"itemid":995,"subject":"Doom and Gloom and Turnovers","event":"Life is meaningless and full of pain.\r\n\r\nEver since I got home from New York City, I have been meaning to post about the great games the Jets and Giants played last weekend.  But there was so much else to catch up on, and only so many hours in the day, and I never got around to it.\r\n\r\nAnd after the two games I saw today, it would seem kind of pointless.  Neither of the New York teams bothered to show up today.  Sad, depressing, gutless performances.  I can't believe are really the same teams I watched last week, and the week before.\r\n\r\nNext week they play each other.  One will win and one will lose, but at this point I hardly think it matters.  I don't think either the Giants or the Jets are going to the playoffs.  And if next week's winner does sneak in, I fear it will be one and done.\r\n\r\nAh, football.  It will break your heart.","ditemid":254817,"eventtime":"2011-12-18 18:29:00","props":{"current_location":"the slough of despond","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":9,"commentalter":1324590890,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sad sack","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1325016512},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-12-19 01:31:21","anum":97,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/254817.html","event_timestamp":1324232940,"reply_count":26,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/9021884/1523329","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/254817.html?thread=15042913#t15042913","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/254817.html?thread=15042913#t15042913","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/254817.html?thread=15042913#t15042913","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"arkham1010","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://arkham1010.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15042913,"talkid":58761,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/254817.html?thread=15042913#t15042913","article":"Hey, its not Tebow time, its Brady Time!
