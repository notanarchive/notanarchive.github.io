{"itemid":591,"subject":"More Odds, More Ends","event":"Lots of stuff going on that I've been meaning to post about... but there's lots of stuff going on, so I haven't had the time.\r\n\r\nStuff stirring on the comic book front, but I can't talk about that yet.  Maybe in a couple months.  Maybe sooner.  Maybe both.\r\n\r\nCool stuff coming in from Cyanide Studios on the videogame too.  Can't share that either.  Sorry, sorry.\r\n\r\nMelinda and I caught the Swedish film of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO a couple nights ago at the Screen.  Highly recommended.  I want to talk about this in detail on my website, on my long neglected \"What I'm Watching\" page, but, alas, I probably won't.  Suffice it to say it was a very faithful adaptation of an excellent novel.  I consumed all three of the Stieg Larsson novels (the last when I was in Ireland last year to watch the pilot filmed) and found them terrific reads, but they're quite graphic, and I was worried about how they'd translate to film.  Very well indeed, as it happens.  At least for this version.  (I shudder to think what the rumored big budget Hollywood remake will be like.  For starts, they will probably move the whole thing from Sweden to California).  Lisbeth Salander is a terrific character, and Noomi Rapace does a superb job of portraying her.  (Hollywood, I fear, will soften the character and make her more \"likeable,\" which will ruin her utterly).  Anyway, see this.  And read the Larsson books, if you haven't done so already.\r\n\r\nOn the \"guilty pleasures\" front, I have been meaning to confess how much I enjoy DEADLIEST WARRIOR on Spike.  All those gel torsos and pig carcasses, what's not to like?  The second season just started here.  Not as cool as the first so far, but still pretty cool.  Given my predilictions, I like the episodes featuring ancient warriors better than the modern ones.  And I still say the Knight was robbed.  He was the only pre-gunpowder warrior who had to go up against an opponent with firearms.  Not fair.  And DEADLIEST WARRIOR also confirms a point I have been trying to hammer home for years, in my books and, more recently, in those Suvudu cage matches -- defense rules.  Armor kicks ass.  Before gunpowder, give me a suit of plate-and-mail, a stout helm, and a whomping big shield, and keep magic out of it, and I'll make mincepie out of unarmored or lightly armored opponents.\r\n\r\nMonkey front.  Whacking at King Kong, making progress, but not as fast or easy as I like.  But Freaky Monkey is finally coming together, and him I should be able to get off my back in the next few weeks.  \r\n\r\nYes, casting is on-going for the HBO series, so I've been seeing a lot of tapes.  No, I won't say who, but it's been fun.  Some actors are household names who would be recognized by any film or television fan, some are veteran character actors, some are brilliant young newcomers.  A wealth of choices.  There are a lot of fine actors out there.  On the other hand, some of these roles are very challenging, to say the least.  (No, there are no obscure hints there).  Parts are being cast in roughly the order they will appear in the show, so right now we're mostly concerned with filling parts for the pilot reshoots and episode two.  Characters like Lord Tywin (who does not appear until my episode, episode eight) and Shae are not going to be cast until much later in the process.  \r\n\r\nIt's not always going to be the most familiar names who get the roles, either.  And to all the dreamers and aspiring actors out there, let me say this -- PLEASE stop sending me your photographs and resumes, I am not the way to get a part on the series.  You need to go through our casting director, not through me.\r\n\r\nWhat else, what else?  More than I can recall.  It's late, and bed beckons.  Tomorrow I have to whack at King Kong again.  \r\n\r\nLater.","ditemid":151442,"eventtime":"2010-05-07 02:08:00","props":{"current_moodid":31,"commentalter":1273543042,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":695,"opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"18:5,33:10,42:4,32:4,3:25,24:7,19:4,4:10,25:27,26:8,20:14,9:4,21:4,nterms:no","revtime":1273543073},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-05-07 08:08:19","anum":146,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/151442.html","event_timestamp":1273198080,"reply_count":70,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120665265/13325517","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/151442.html?thread=9814930#t9814930","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/151442.html?thread=9814930#t9814930","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/151442.html?thread=9814930#t9814930","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"flake_sake","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://flake-sake.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9814930,"talkid":38339,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/151442.html?thread=9814930#t9814930","article":"I'm very much with you on the Lisbeth Salander love. <br /><br />They did a terrific job with the tv adaption.

I really enjoyed it.  One thing I will say is that the Scandinavian film makers take their time and let the story flow and develop. I agree that anything done in Hollywood will be half as long and half as good.  <br /><br />Now you just have to go see the other two movies.  I saw the 2nd one and will be watching the 3rd tonight :)  The second one was good, but not quite as good as the first movie.  I haven't read the books yet so I can't say how it compares.  You might enjoy KickAss.  I thought it would be silly to the point of stupidity, but I was very impressed.
