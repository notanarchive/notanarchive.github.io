Last night, for the first time, I was able to watch the Making of feature on real live HBO (thank you DirecTV for 3 free months:-)) and I have to say, I have never been more excited!! The clips of the show looked and felt more real and powerful than they did on a laptop. Watching it in HD for the first time in all of this, it felt BIG and strong and passionate and real!! This thing is going to be a hit, no doubts anymore.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"April 7 2011, 18:17:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Making of Opinion","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://trilambdas.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"trilambdas","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"trilambdas","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://trilambdas.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"trilambdas","ctime_ts":1302200265,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109669761/37056352","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208519.html?thread=12892295#t12892295","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208519.html?thread=12892295#t12892295","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208519.html?thread=12892295#t12892295","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_495010","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/sstines","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12892295,"talkid":50360,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/208519.html?thread=12892295#t12892295","upictitle":"Shane Stines: pic#109669761","article":"I hear Joe Abercrombie will be interviewing you soon?

I was very impressed with the preview for A Game of Thrones. The wall, and the scenary beyond The Wall were amazing. I just have one question. In your opinion, why were the mysterious creatures beyond the wall changed to resemble Uruk-hai with glowing eyes. Creatively, the new image of these monsters, seems somewhat unintriguing compared to your original conception. Their fiery appearance and demeanor (and tacky growling sound effects) seem at odds with the cold, icy landscape of the North. I also felt that they too closely resembled the zombies shown in the preview, which may confuse some viewers. From a logical standpoint, is it wise to make such dramatic, and unnessecary changes to your creations. After all, Lords of the Rings, Harry Potter etc managed to create faithful adaptations from book to film, which I'm sure is much less confusing for new viewers eager to jump ahead in the story by reading the books. Other than that the preview was _fairly_ well directed. I probably would have introduced the scounting party a little clearer through dialogue and would have made Will a bit more blubbery and insane looking before his execution. Arya and Jon look great in their roles. I'm confident that it will be a high quality adaptation.
