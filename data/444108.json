{"itemid":1734,"subject":"Coming to the Cocteau","event":"For all you New Mexican out there... and for travellers passing through the Land of Enchantment... we have lots of cool stuff coming to the Jean Cocteau Cinema these next couple of months, starting this Friday when we open EVEREST.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"601\"/>\r\n\r\nWe also have some cool special events and booksignings coming up.\r\n\r\nOn October 6, WILLIAM GIBSON, the father of cyberpunk, will be here for an interview and Q&A, and to sign copies of new novel THE PERIPHERAL.  Reserve your copies early; we expect a sellout, as with many of our author events.\r\n\r\nFrom October 9 through October 14, we'll be hosting a WES CRAVEN RETROSPECTIVE, to honor the late great director whose death on August 30 saddened millions of his fans.  I had the honor of working with Wes once -- he directed one of my TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, though sadly the episode was gutted by CBS before broadcast.  A great guy, and an immense talent.  We'll be showing several of his best known films, and hope to bring in some special guests via Skype.\r\n\r\nOn November 8, another author event.  This time we are bringing in bestselling author DEBORAH HARKNESS.  Harkness was originally scheduled a few months ago, but flight delays forced a cancellation... but this time we hope the airlines will be more helpful, and get her to Santa Fe on time.\r\n\r\nWe had sold-out houses for our burlesque performances earlier this month, so we're going to do it again... this time with the SUICIDE GIRLS!  \r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"602\"/>\r\n\r\nAlas, our small (very small) stage at the JCC isn't big enough to accomodate all the Suicide Girls, so we'll be offering a somewhat downscaled version of their usual show... but that should still be pretty kickass, and there is something to be said for an intimate setting.  And as everyone who has seen them knows, the Suicide Girls never disappoint.  \r\n\r\nThat one should be a sellout too.  Tickets are $35 (18 and over, please) and can be bought on the JCC website at http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/event/suicide-girls-blackheart-burlesque/?instance_id=36360 .  A portion of every ticket will be donated to our friends at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary down in Candy Kitchen.\r\n\r\nSee you at the show!","ditemid":444108,"eventtime":"2015-09-23 14:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, movies, signings, signed books","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1443167899,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Coming to the Cocteau http://goo.gl/wXRC9T","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.661284814540465]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1443041926}","revtime":1443559680},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-09-23 20:58:42","anum":204,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444108.html","event_timestamp":1443020340,"reply_count":4,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125433299/76836705","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444108.html?thread=22681036#t22681036","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444108.html?thread=22681036#t22681036","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444108.html?thread=22681036#t22681036","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dannydemiurge","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dannydemiurge.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22681036,"talkid":88597,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/444108.html?thread=22681036#t22681036","upictitle":"dannydemiurge: pic#125433299","article":"William Gibson!

I couldn't believe Rob Hall died up there. Just so shocking. <br /><br />For those who don't know, among the highest mountains, Everest is not considered a challenging (for the mountains we're talking about) climb. This stuff happens on K2, Nanga Parbat, Annapurna, etc... Not on Everest. Just such a shock when this happened. <br /><br />RIP Rob Hall, Scott Fischer and all those lost in the 96 Everest tragedy.
