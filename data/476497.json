I can't remember it all off the top of my head, but as I recall it started its life as a script for a project that was canned, after which Ihimaera (also the author of <i>Whale Rider</i>, btw) wrote it as a story which was adapted to film by Dana Rotberg, a Mexican director, after which Ihimaera expanded the story to a novella that was released as an ebook. Or something like that. It's covered in the story notes in <i>Asks the Posts of the House</i>. Anyway. A powerful story and a powerful and painful film.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"March 7 2016, 02:05:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mastadge.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mastadge","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mastadge","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mastadge.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mastadge","ctime_ts":1457316350,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125214801/76457752","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476497.html?replyto=24089425","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476497.html?thread=24089425#t24089425","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476497.html?thread=24089425#t24089425","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476497.html?thread=24089425#t24089425","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3225823","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10100278071556205/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24089425,"talkid":94099,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/476497.html?thread=24089425#t24089425","upictitle":"April Hill: pic#125214801","article":"I don't remember, but did your theater do a screening of this brilliant film?
