{"itemid":442,"subject":"Odds and Ends","event":"Time is flying by again, and I am starting to get stressed out, as always before travel.  I'm home this weekend, but the weekend following I am off to Fargo for Valleycon.  Get back on Monday, have a few days at home, and then I am off again for my big trip across the pond to visit the shoot, do those signings in Ireland, and then down to Morocco for more of the pilot.  And so much to do before I leave...\r\n\r\nTravel has gotten so bloody complicated these days.  Even with a good travel agent, the airlines make things as difficult as possible with all these fares, rules, schedules, etc.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, the Jets have picked up Braylon Edwards from the Browns.  Not sure how I feel about that.  Supposedly he's a \"big time receiver,\" whatever that is, but he leads the leagues in drops.  I like my big time receivers to catch the ball.  Also, he punched out that little guy at a nightclub, and could very well be facing a suspension.  Besides, I liked Chansi Stuckey, thought he had a lot of promise.  Well, we'll see.\r\n\r\nAnother part cast on the pilot.  Our prologue trio is now complete.  \r\n\r\nAnybody who wants to buy a book from my website, this is the time to do it.  I'll be taking orders through next Thursday, then closing things down until Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nBack to work.","ditemid":113244,"eventtime":"2009-10-07 13:33:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":239,"current_moodid":28,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1276704587,"personifi_tags":"18:30,6:3,8:11,37:7,46:3,23:7,1:11,3:38,4:7,39:7,20:7,9:11,22:7,13:15,34:3,nterms:no","verticals_list":"travel"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-10-07 19:41:28","anum":92,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html","event_timestamp":1254922380,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/85553320/2114520","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?replyto=7684956","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7684956#t7684956","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7684956#t7684956","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7684956#t7684956","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"slojae","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://slojae.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7684956,"talkid":30019,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7684956#t7684956","upictitle":"James Cheney: pic#85553320","article":"have a nice trip... and maybe you'll come across something to help with that myraneese knot<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"October 7 2009, 19:45:04 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://slojae.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"slojae","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"slojae","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://slojae.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"slojae","ctime_ts":1254944704,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115718554/703016","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?replyto=7685212","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685212#t7685212","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685212#t7685212","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685212#t7685212","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jayphoenix","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jayphoenix.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7685212,"talkid":30020,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685212#t7685212","upictitle":"Jay Faulkner: rdd","article":"Don't stress too muich, despite the hoops the security people at the airports put you through ... you will have a great time (I hope) visiting Ireland and us (the lucky ones who get to meet you in Belfast) will be evry grateful that you made the effort to come over!<br /><br />See you at Easons! :o)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"October 7 2009, 19:50:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jayphoenix.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jayphoenix","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jayphoenix","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jayphoenix.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jayphoenix","ctime_ts":1254945047,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?replyto=7685468","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685468#t7685468","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685468#t7685468","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685468#t7685468","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7685468,"talkid":30021,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/113244.html?thread=7685468#t7685468","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Morocco, exciting!
