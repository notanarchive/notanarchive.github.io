{"itemid":4,"event":"Has it really been three months since my first post?  \r\n\r\n Since opening \"Not A Blog\" back in July, I have been spending half my time on the road.  We took off in late July for Ireland, followed by the worldcon in Glasgow, then several additional weeks of travel through the UK.  I saw my British editors in Glasgow and again in London, had meetings with several artists that I'm working with or hope to work with, and stood in front of castles to get a more up-to-date jacket photograph.  And somewhere in there I had a wonderful lunch with some of my fellow toy soldier collectors, enjoyed the marvelous hospitality of Peter and Gilly Greenhill and saw the Courtenay Molds (sacred to every knights guy), and partied with the wild men and hot babes of the Brotherhood Without Banners, Europe.  So it wasn't all business.\r\n\r\n By the time I got home, the usual mountain of mail and email awaited me, and no sooner had I dug my way out than it was time to take off again, this time for the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C.  I got a great crowd at my speech, and it was a real kick (albeit somewhat intimidating)to follow John Irving, Neil Gaiman, and Tom Wolfe (all writers whose work I've admired)on the stage.  Thanks to all those who turned up.  Those who couldn't make it can find a webcast of my speech at the festival by following the link on my News page.\r\n\r\n Anyway, that's what I've been doing since my last entry... some of the time, at least.  (I have also been doing lots of tedious post production work on FEAST and several other projects, checking cover copy and correcting the maps and signing signature pages and going over the galleys and all sorts of other boring stuff).  And on Friday I'm off again, headed back to England for my British book tour, and then the Lucca Game and Comics Show in Italy.  After that my US book tour will be looming.  So I probably won't be posting here again until after Thanksgiving.  (If then).\r\n\r\n I warned you that I was no good at this blogging stuff.\r\n\r\n Anyway, I do hope I'll be seeing many of you in England or Italy or wherever.  If I have a slightly glazed look on my face and don't seem to know what country I'm in, forgive me.  It has been a long year, and I'm tired.  \r\n\r\n Oh, one thing before I run... I have gotten a lot of emails asking about my \"policies\" at signings.  Truth is, I have only one policy.  I will sign old books as well as the new one, and I will sign as many books as you bring... but only three at a time.  If you bring more, I will still sign them all, but after the first three you need to go back to the end of the line to give others a chance.  \r\n\r\n That's not to say there won't be other limitations.  The bookshops where I am appearing may have policies of their own.  Some require tickets, some will only allow me to sign books purchased at the store, some permit photographs and some do not.  Their call, not mine.  So if you are thinking of going to one of the events and would like to know what rules and restrictions will be in effect, you want to call the bookstore and ask.\r\n\r\n See you there.","ditemid":1279,"eventtime":"2005-10-09 22:23:00","props":{"commentalter":1244253963,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2005-10-10 04:58:28","anum":255,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html","event_timestamp":1128896580,"reply_count":3,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?replyto=745727","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=745727#t745727","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=745727#t745727","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=745727#t745727","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":745727,"talkid":2912,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=745727#t745727","article":"[url]http://www.geocities.com/problem397<wbr />play/professional-online-poker-player.ht<wbr />m[/url]","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"October 3 2006, 15:24:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"poil9xf","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1159889042,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/25527627/5932852","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?replyto=748799","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=748799#t748799","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=748799#t748799","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=748799#t748799","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"swiftedg","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://swiftedg.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":748799,"talkid":2924,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1279.html?thread=748799#t748799","upictitle":"swiftedg: eat me 1up!","article":"<br />7 External links <br /><a href=\"http://viagra-cialis.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">viagra cialis</a><br />2 Chemical information <br /><a href=\"http://cialis-sample.sotdiha.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">cialis sample</a><br /><a href=\"http://buy-cialis.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cialis</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://buy-cheap-viagra-online.porapahat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cheap viagra online</a><br />Drug interactions - organic nitrates<br /><a href=\"http://buy-cheap-viagra-online.msna.info\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cheap viagra online</a><br /><a href=\"http://cialis-vs-viagra.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">cialis vs viagra</a><br /><a href=\"http://gambling-casino.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">gambling casino</a><br /><a href=\"http://buy-cheap-viagra-online.izmena.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cheap viagra online</a><br />Cialis at work<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://buy-cheap-viagra-online.zamesto.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cheap viagra online</a><br /><a href=\"http://internet-black-jack.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">internet black jack</a><br /><a href=\"http://black-jack-online.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">black jack online</a><br /><a href=\"http://buy-cheap-viagra-online.sotdiha.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cheap viagra online</a><br />The most common side effects when using Cialis are headache, indigestion, back pain, muscle aches, flushing, and stuffy or runny nose. These side effects usually go away after a few hours. Patients who get back pain and muscle aches usually get it 12 to 24 hours after taking the drug, and the symptom usually goes away after 48 hours.<br />The empirical formula for Cialis is C22H19N3O4, and its official organic name is (6R,12aR)-6-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2,3,6,7,1<wbr />2,12a- hexahydro-2-methyl-pyrazino[1 ,2 :1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-1,4-dione. The molecular weight is 389.41. The tablets are yellow, film-coated, and almond-shaped, and are produced in 5, 10, or 20mg doses.<br /><a href=\"http://gambling-casino.sotdiha.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">gambling casino                </a><br /><a href=\"http://internet-black-jack.sotdiha.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">internet black jack    </a><br />Since PDE5 inhibitors such as Cialis may cause transiently low blood pressure (hypotension), organic nitrates should not be taken for at least 48 hours after taking the last dose of Cialis. <br />Cialis is a drug used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence). <br />It works by inhibiting an enzyme known as PDE5. A 20 mg dose of Cialis is comparable to a 100 mg dose of sildenafil (Viagra).<br /><a href=\"http://buy-cheap-viagra-online.comlive.biz\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy cheap viagra online</a><br />Side effects<br /><a href=\"http://cialis-side-effects.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">cialis side effects</a><br /><br />Contents [hide]<br /><a href=\"http://generic-cialis.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">generic cialis</a><br /><a href=\"http://play-black-jack-online.vernulsa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">play black jack online </a><br />In the United States, Cialis has Food and Drug Administration approval and became available in December, 2003 as the third pill after Viagra and Levitra.
