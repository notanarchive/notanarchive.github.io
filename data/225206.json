{"itemid":879,"subject":"Stuff and Nonsense","event":"Just flipped over the page on my World Wildlife Fund calendar (a day late, sue me), and was amused to see that the featured animals for July are gorillas.  Nothing could be more fitting for the month in which Kong is finally loosed upon the reading public.  heh\r\n\r\nOn other fronts... I mentioned below that WARRIORS won the Locus Award as the best anthology of 2010, which pleased me no end... but I forgot to mention that Gardner Dozois and I have just signed with Tor for a sequel of sorts.  A mammoth crossgenre book featuring contributions from an all-star lineup of award-winning writers and bestsellers from half a dozen different genres and subgenres.  This one has the working title DANGEROUS WOMEN.  Whether that will be the final title or not, I am less sure.  Must admit, I do not love it; too generic for my taste.  I wanted to call the book FEMMES FATALE, but our editor suggested that no one younger than forty would have any idea what that phrase meant.  Which boggles the hell out of me, but what do I know?  Could be we'll settle on WOMEN WARRIORS.  Though that's limiting in a different sort of way.  But whatever title it goes by in the end, it should be a helluva anthology.  We have some great writers lined up, as we did with WARRIORS.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, DANGEROUS WOMEN will include the fourth Dunk & Egg novella, the long-promised tale of their visit to the North, where they encounter the She-Wolves of Winterfell.  I could tell you more than that, but then I'd need to kill you.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ice & Fire continues its slow conquest of the world, nation by nation and language by language.  I've just signed a deal for Turkish editions, and we're negotiating with a Vietnamese publisher as well.  \r\n\r\nAnd my US book tour is coming up fast, so these days have been busy ones.  At the moment I am finishing up the first draft of my script for the second season of the HBO series, hammering out the overplot of the new Wild Cards book LOWBALL, and of course doing what seems like ten interviews a day.  Would that there were four of me.\r\n\r\nThese are exciting days.","ditemid":225206,"eventtime":"2011-07-02 11:12:00","props":{"current_location":"santa fe  ","taglist":"foreign editions, anthologies, a song of ice and fire, a dance with dragons, dunk & egg","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1310164342,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"kong2","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1310318711},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-02 17:29:47","anum":182,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html","event_timestamp":1309605120,"reply_count":71,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14017718#t14017718","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14017718#t14017718","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14017718#t14017718","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rappy7","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rappy7.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14017718,"talkid":54756,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14017718#t14017718","upictitle":"rappy7: pic#98942159","article":"It seems your editor wants to cater to the \"those who do not read\" book audience.

I'm curious, of course, about what else it will contain - I love good stories about strong women.<br /><br />And I'd like to echo aulus_poliutos' call (above) for a volume with all the Dunk and Egg stories together. They are just wonderful and a perfect backstory to ASOIAF. *grin*<br /><br />Oh, and bravo for supporting WWF.  :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 2 2011, 19:32:09 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lahela-sga.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lahela_sga","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lahela_sga","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lahela-sga.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lahela_sga","ctime_ts":1309635129,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109915172/10560429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14024118#t14024118","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14024118#t14024118","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14024118#t14024118","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nycfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14024118,"talkid":54781,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/225206.html?thread=14024118#t14024118","upictitle":"nycfalcon: pic#109915172","article":"It's not only that many won't know what it means, they also will think it's one of those foreign books.
