{"itemid":1250,"subject":"LOWBALL Done & Delivered","event":"Another monkey off my back...\r\n\r\nThis time it is a hideous mutant joker monkey.  LOWBALL, the twenty-second volume in the ongoing Wild Cards series of shared world anthologies and mosaic novels, is finally complete, and has been delivered to our editors at Tor.\r\n\r\nThe lineup this time:\r\n  “The Big Bleed,” by Michael Cassutt, starring STUNTMAN,\r\n  “Those About to Die,” by David Anthony Durham, starring INFAMOUS BLACK TONGUE,\r\n   “Galahad in Blue” by Melinda Snodgrass, starring FRANCIS XAVIER BLACK of the NYPD,\r\n   “Ties That Bind” by Mary Anne Mohanraj, starring MICHAEL STEVENS of the NYPD,\r\n   “Cry Wolf” by David D. Levine, introducing THE CARTOONIST,\r\n   “Road Kill” by Walter Jon Williams, starring GORDON THE GHOUL,\r\n   “Once More, for Old Time’s Sake” by Carrie Vaughn, starring EARTH WITCH, CURVBALL, DRUMMER BOY, and JOHN FORTUNE,\r\n   “No Parking… “ by Ian Tregillis, starring RUSTBELT.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks this time around to Melinda Snodgrass, who stepped in heroically to help with the editing on this one when I was being crushed beneath the weight of other deadlines.  I could not have pulled this puppy together without her.\r\n\r\nLOWBALL will likely be released by Tor in hardcover in summer, 2014.  More details when I have 'em.  Our main man, Michael Komarck, is already hard at work on another spectacular cover.","ditemid":320136,"eventtime":"2013-04-12 16:23:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, anthologies","current_moodid":42,"commentalter":1366430277,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"ape","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1366912820},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-04-12 22:23:41","anum":136,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html","event_timestamp":1365783780,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/96764572/3615924","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17566856#t17566856","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17566856#t17566856","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17566856#t17566856","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"oortdust","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://oortdust.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17566856,"talkid":68620,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17566856#t17566856","upictitle":"oortdust: Damask","article":"YAY!!<br /><br />I'm starting a friend on the series so I'm glad to know I can keep her hooked for even longer!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 12 2013, 22:45:23 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://oortdust.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"oortdust","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"oortdust","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://oortdust.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"oortdust","ctime_ts":1365806723,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/52265829/193288","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17568136#t17568136","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17568136#t17568136","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17568136#t17568136","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"darthfrog","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://darthfrog.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17568136,"talkid":68625,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/320136.html?thread=17568136#t17568136","upictitle":"Robert Fargher: pic#52265829","article":"I wonder what is involved with such an editing job?
