{"itemid":1095,"subject":"Last Chance for Longclaw","event":"Just got a note from Chris Beasley at Valyrian Steel.\r\n\r\nHe writes, \"Just wanted to let you know that Longclaw is almost permanently sold out. I do not expect it to last through the month of June.\"\r\n\r\nSo if perchance you're one of the folks who has been saving your dimes and nickles to pick up one of the Longclaw replicas, act now, or you may soon be out of luck.  These swords are limited editions, so once they are gone, they are gone.  Valyrian Steel will not be making any more.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002dxer/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002dxer/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"119\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\n(I should add that Valyrian Steel has obtained a license from HBO to produce replicas of the weapons seen on the TV series, so they will be producing a \"show Longclaw\" at some point down the line.  I don't believe that one will be a limited run.  This post relates only to their current version of Jon Snow's blade, produced under a direct license from me -- the \"book Longclaw,\" that is.  That's the one that is almost sold out).\r\n\r\nTo order, head over to the Valyrian Steel website at\r\nhttp://www.valyriansteel.com/shop/","ditemid":280340,"eventtime":"2012-06-01 11:43:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"limited editions, valyrian steel","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1338339695,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1340218367},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-05-21 17:46:06","anum":20,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html","event_timestamp":1338550980,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115052553/44937915","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16003860#t16003860","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16003860#t16003860","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16003860#t16003860","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_946458","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002314927985","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16003860,"talkid":62515,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16003860#t16003860","upictitle":"Michael Lundmark: pic#115052553","article":"Hi Mr Martin. <br /><br />I was just wondering, are these replicas which are sanctioned by you Canon, as in This is how they looked in the books?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"May 21 2012, 18:13:14 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Canon","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002314927985","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Michael Lundmark","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_946458","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=44937915&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Michael Lundmark","ctime_ts":"1337623994","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16004628#t16004628","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16004628#t16004628","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16004628#t16004628","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"masekger","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://masekger.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16004628,"talkid":62518,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/280340.html?thread=16004628#t16004628","above":16003860,"upictitle":"masekger: pic#0","article":"The canonization of a longsword would require at least an ex cathedra statement made in a conclave of editors ;-).<br /><br />Seriously, those knifes come with papers signed by George R.
