They are the central characters of the stories, but they play witness to some significant events in history, or provide insights into some of the unjust and unpleasant everyday happenings, in the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />If you've read the series, you'll have read about Dunk and Egg. See Jon's first chapter in ACoK, or Jaime's chapter in ASoS where he reads Barristan's entry in the White Book, or in AFfC when Maester Aemon describes his send-off to the Wall to Sam.<br /><br />The first novella, \"The Hedge Knight\", was nominated for a World Fantasy Award. It's filled with tourney champions, jousts, Targaryen princes, and a good old bit of ultra-violence. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812575237/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a> has used copies and new copies from third-party sellers available.
