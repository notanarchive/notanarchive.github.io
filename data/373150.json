I'd long (and especially multi-volume) epics so I can get comfortable and know the characters. Short stories can be a bit difficult to get into because you are constantly meeting new characters and new writing styles. <br /><br />I have started to appreciate this. I get in and out. If I don't like something then I didn't waste alot of time. I am finding that I am discovering new authors with these multi-author anthologies. I have also found that authors write somewhat differently in short stories. They tend to have a bit of a twist to it. These kinds of things don't really work in longer novels. However, when its a get in and get out type of thing, they work very well. <br /><br />I encourage people to read these kinds of anthologies. Its a great way to get a taste of new authors. Some of you may find this difficult to believe, but this is how I discovered Robert Silverberg. I was not in tune with the SF community at the time (not really involved now either) and had no idea who he was in the late 1990s. I bought the first legends book for the Robert Jordan story and in part for George's story. While I enjoyed those, I already knew those authors. I really enjoyed Silverberg's Marjipoor story. It got me to read alot more of his work. I probably wouldn't have ended up reading him at all if not for that anthology. <br /><br />I have made a decision that when I get a new anthology I am going to read the authors I have not read first. So I can explore new authors, then if I like the story, google them and see what else they have done.
