My HBO (HBO Canada) subscription is up and running and I am now just counting down the remaining days until the premiere.  From HBO I have already purchased two of the shows signature T-Shirts, the Lannister House stein or mug with their logo and \"Hear Me Roar\" (it is a lot heavier than I thought it will be, which is fine because its quality is good).  I have also purchased the new editions of all four published novels, plus the HBO-tie-in edition with Ned on the cover, I also have this year's 2011 calendar and will surely purchase the 2012 edition.  In addition I have also bought the first volume of \"The Art Of A Song Of Ice And Fire\", I have also ordered and waiting to receive the second volume of \"The Art Of A Song Of Ice And Fire\" which was published recently.  The purchase of the \"Game Of Thrones\" DVD set of the first season is a given and I will be there to pick-it up once it comes out, and of course I am looking forward to the publication of \"A Dance With Dragons\".<br /><br />This the only way I could think to thank you and all the people over at HBO for your great work and effort.  My hope is that in whatever small and indirect way this will help the ASOIF novels become even more successful, respected and recognized, because you so richly deserve it.  I also hope that HBO will be convinced that they have something viable and profitable on their hands and thus ensure a multi-season arch that will cover the entire saga.<br /><br />Thank you once again for everything.  Now I will sign-off for a while, actually until the show has aired in its entirety.  As someone pointed out there is such a thing as information overload, trailers, behind the scenes, interviews, reviews etc.  <br /><br />I will be back around these hallowed grounds around July to see what has transpired in the land of ice and fire and see how it all has gone down.  I will retreat and just simply enjoy the books and the show!<br /><br />I wish everybody involved good luck, all the best!  I hope this turns out to be HUGE?!!??!  <br /><br />Bye now sir...be well...until next time!

I think it's great you got to try some!  <br /><br />It's also inspired us to start a blog in which we attempt to cook and bake our way through the delicious foods in your books.  Our mouths always watered when reading about the feasts, or even about the more simple fare up on The Wall, and our experiment so far has yielded tasty results. We guestimate there will be around 170 dishes, but that's before the next book comes out!  :)<br /><br />Thank you so much for all your hard work and imagination.  You've inspired many of us to also take up a creative mantle and try fun new things!
