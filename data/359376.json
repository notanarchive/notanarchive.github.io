{"itemid":1403,"subject":"Magic & Mystery ","event":"Everyone needs a little magic in his life.\r\n\r\nSo come join us at the Jean Cocteau next week, for MAGIC &amp; MYSTERY WEEK.&nbsp; Starting this Friday, the whole week will devoted to wizards, sorcerers, illusionists, and practitioners of the dark arts (like screenwriting).\r\n\r\nFor starts, we have three movies opening.\r\n\r\nDESPERATE ACTS OF MAGIC is a delightful new romantic comedy about magicians.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"410\" />\r\n\r\nTHE PRESTIGE... well, what can I say?&nbsp; Based on the novel by Christopher Priest, this tale of a bitter feud between two rival magicians is becoming a classic, and may well be the best film about the world of magic ever made.&nbsp; Directed by Christopher Nolan, adapted from the novel by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan, it stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johanssen, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"411\" />\r\n\r\nAnd, for our midnight shows, we have THE RAVEN, Edgar Allen Poe by way of Roger Corman, starring Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, and Boris Karloff.&nbsp; (Yes, and Jack Nicholson, believe it or not).\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"412\" />\r\n\r\nThe movies are just part of Magic and Mystery Week, however.\r\n\r\nWe also thrilled to present the first live-in-person magic ever offered at the Jean Cocteau: three performances by the Amazing MISTY LEE, straight from LA&#39;s famed Magic Castle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Misty will be performing three shows only, so be sure to catch them if you&#39;re in the area.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"CocteauPoster-MistyLee\" height=\"600\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/191866/191866_600.jpg\" title=\"CocteauPoster-MistyLee\" width=\"400\" />\r\n\r\nAnd last, but certainly not least, on Sunday February 23, we will be joined at the Cocteau by JONATHAN NOLAN, screenwriter on THE PRESTIGE and MEMENTO, showrunner on PERSON OF INTEREST, and all around terrific talent.&nbsp; Jonathan will be introducing THE PRESTIGE and answering questions about the film... and he and I will also be doing a dialogue about scriptwriting and adaptation on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; Should be fun.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Jonah headshot high res\" height=\"600\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/192170/192170_600.jpg\" title=\"Jonah headshot high res\" width=\"416\" />\r\n\r\nAdvance tickets to the movies, the magic shows, and the dialogue are all available on the Cocteau website.\r\n\r\nSo come join the fun.&nbsp; We promise not to saw you in half.","ditemid":359376,"eventtime":"2014-02-19 01:17:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, films","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1393568948,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1393569066},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-02-19 08:17:32","anum":208,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html","event_timestamp":1392772620,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/9963724/439663","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18742224#t18742224","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18742224#t18742224","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18742224#t18742224","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"yagathai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18742224,"talkid":73211,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18742224#t18742224","upictitle":"Names Is For Tombstones, Baby: Rocketeer","article":"Oh man, The Raven is one of my all-time favorites!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"February 19 2014, 15:05:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"yagathai","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"yagathai","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://yagathai.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"yagathai","ctime_ts":1392822347,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125645011/68914526","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18743760#t18743760","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18743760#t18743760","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18743760#t18743760","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"arksa_apocrypha","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://arksa-apocrypha.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18743760,"talkid":73217,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/359376.html?thread=18743760#t18743760","above":18742224,"upictitle":"arksa_apocrypha: pic#125645011","article":"  <q>The Raven is one of my all-time favorites!</q><br />Indeed, I have a VHS copy of it.
