and I have now a Wild Card example full of my fingerprints and less words in it.<br />Note that I'm not complaining, I love having special books, and altough I would get one clean and dry for free if I'd give back mine, there's no way I'd get rid of it. <br /> That book will ever stay alongside my Glen Cook's Black Company where it took me several years and an another example to find out that the couple pages I thought was missing was in fact TWO CHAPTERS...<br />Same editor...<br />In my opinion a bad edition is better than none but in this case they went for such a cheap ink (I guess) that it may very well impact negatively on Wild Cards, for 10 euros it would not be an issue but for 20 euros they are bad cooks destroying a good recipe.<br />But again, I understand that you may not have any power in that matter.<br /><br />Anyway, due to translation times, I must thank you again, the wait for ASOIAF to get translated got me to read in English (wich I did but it was a pain) and, being ahead of the Wild Cards one, I bought an english version knowing that I'll be able to enjoy it.<br />You're currently the only writers I care enough to read in english ( others I can find in French

Scott Stephens: pic#125501990","article":"I know how much you love off topic posts but I read that post about you having more SF stories to tell and I can't help it. <br /><br />Man, I'd love to read more science fiction from you before you retire. I know this Ice and Fire thing is kind of big and unfinished (were you aware of that?) but you have written some truly amazing sci fi in your day. I feel like you've gotten better with age. More patient, perhaps, but whatever the reason, I'd love to see a modern sci fi story from you.   <br /><br />This makes me want to re-read Nightflyers but I don't think I still have my copy of that short story collection you released ages ago. I think A Song for Lya was in there, too. Nightflyers was the centerpiece for me, though. That Ridley Scott feel to it was just awesome. I remember being legitimately scared shitless for the crew. The atmosphere you built there was terrific. The ending is legendary.<br /><br />It'd be a damn shame if you don't get at least one more short story out of your abilities in that genre. I know 90% of your fans would FREAK out (and I mean that in a true sense) if you did this, but I wouldn't mind if you pulled a Stephen King and wrote something else for awhile after Winds. It was never as big as your series, but it was never all Dark Tower, all the time for him. Same with Glen Cook, it wasn't The Black Company constantly. It kind of sucks that's the hand you've been dealt. I'd love to see you explore some of the ideas you're bound to have going on. Some of them are most likely great... <br /><br />Well, whatever... just rambling. Sorry about that. Love that cover. I just got my first Kindle for Christmas so I'll make sure to pick this up. Have a good 2017, George. <br /><br />PS: Sorry about football but being a Cleveland fan, fuck football.

My question is, if the Cowboys win the Super Bowl, could I convince you to send me an autograph?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 11 2017, 21:28:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Football","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://landosmitty.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"landosmitty","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"landosmitty","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://landosmitty.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"landosmitty","ctime_ts":1484170132,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515346.html?thread=25572626#t25572626","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515346.html?thread=25572626#t25572626","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515346.html?thread=25572626#t25572626","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515346.html?thread=25572626#t25572626","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25572626,"talkid":99893,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515346.html?thread=25572626#t25572626","above":25572370,"upictitle":"George R.R.
