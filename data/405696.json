And for all their shocking additions to the novels, they somehow never capture the barbarity of Westeros culture.  Reading about Raff recount The Mountain's rape of that little girl was more shocking that all the naked shots in the HBO series.  The REAL red wedding was more dramatic than the SHOCKER OMG HE STABBED THE PREGGERS CHICK in the HBO version.  <br /><br />Shock shots are the crutch of inferior writers.  And if they cut a few minutes of boob shots, they might actually be able to fit in vital plot lines - for example Tywin's orchestrated gang bang of Tyrion's first wife.  But then, how would the feeble-minded writers at HBO even understand why that plot line was vital to Tyrion's character and motivations?
