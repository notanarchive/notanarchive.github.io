{"itemid":1565,"subject":"Weekend Contests","event":"Some big big contests this weekend.\r\n\r\nIn the NFL, it&#39;s the divisional round.&nbsp; On Saturday, Baltimore is at New England and the Carolina Panthers are at Seattle.&nbsp;&nbsp; My former assistant Ty is a big Panthers fan, so my feelings for them are largely positive... but I like the Seahawks too.&nbsp; I had a very pleasant breakfast with their owner a few months ago. I have no favorite in that game.&nbsp; Of couse, I will be rooting hard for the Ravens to defeat Evil Little Bill and his Patriots.&nbsp; Hey, they are named in honor of Edgar Allen Poe, a fellow writer... and while it is true they beat my Giants in a SuperBowl once, it&#39;s been a long time, I forgive them.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, it is Dallas at Green Bay and Indianapolis at Denver.&nbsp; I am for Denver in the AFC game; after all, Peyton is Eli&#39;s big brother.&nbsp; And the Colts should never have left Baltimore besides, so pfui to the Irsays.&nbsp; The early game, hey, no contest, I have hated and despised the Cowboys even longer than I have hated the Patriots, so I will be pulling hard for Green Bay and that baaaaad man Aaron Rogers.\r\n\r\n(Meanwhile, I will also be rooting for the Jets to get a kickass GM and head coach, for Rex to get another head coaching job, and for my Giants to bring back Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator).\r\n\r\nThe NFL isn&#39;t the only contest this weekend.&nbsp; This year&#39;s Golden Globe Awards will also be presented on Sunday night, and GAME OF THRONES is nominated in Best Dramatic Series.&nbsp; The competition this time around is HOUSE OF CARDS, THE AFFAIR, THE GOOD WIFE, and DOWNTON ABBEY.&nbsp;&nbsp; David Benioff and Dan Weiss and Carolyn Strauss and a number of our other producers and cast members will be on hand at the ceremony, though I won&#39;t be there myself this year.&nbsp; But I will watching from home and cheering loudly for the show, and hoping that my friends and colleagues get a Globe (the GG rules are such that I would not get one myself, even if we win).\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion:\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:1.4em;\">GO RAVENS\r\nGO PACKERS\r\nGO DRAGONS\r\nGO DIREWOLVES</span>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:1.8em;\">GO HBO!</span>","ditemid":400660,"eventtime":"2015-01-09 16:42:00","props":{"current_mood":"anxious","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl, awards, television, hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":4,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1421026049,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Weekend Contests http://j.mp/1KtTUit","picture_keyword":"hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.65088240486987]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1420846963}","revtime":1421090625},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-01-09 23:42:27","anum":20,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400660.html","event_timestamp":1420821720,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124455122/73871232","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400660.html?thread=20075028#t20075028","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400660.html?thread=20075028#t20075028","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400660.html?thread=20075028#t20075028","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2956440","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Riz_zaman","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20075028,"talkid":78418,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/400660.html?thread=20075028#t20075028","upictitle":"Riza Zaman: pic#124455122","article":"Hello Mr. Martin,<br /><br />NYG fan here - Spags would be a good choice for NYG's DC, any thoughts on Pepper Johnson (Defensive Line Coach for Buffalo Bills) for the same position?
