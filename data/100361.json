{"itemid":392,"subject":"No News Is...","event":"... no news.\r\n\r\nNo announcements from HBO yet.  Sorry, I have no idea when they will release the names of the six actors cast but not announced.  Soon, I hope.  I know the speculation has driven many of you quite mad.  \r\n\r\nThings are progressing, though.  The production offices have opened in Belfast, and soon pre-production will be underway in earnest.  We have had a postponement, though: filming will start two weeks later than previously announced, on October 26 rather than October 12.  No big thing, just a tweak to allow David and Dan and the rest of the gang to get all the ducks in a row.  On a project of this size, you can't have crooked ducks.\r\n\r\nI expect to hear that several more roles have been filled by week's end.  Though that doesn't mean I will be able to tell you who has filled them.  Sorry.\r\n\r\nHaving worked in television myself for ten years, I understand how tough the choices can be sometimes, and I understand what David and Dan and Tom McCarthy are going through:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK87ejPDZOk\r\n\r\nSo all I can say is... be patient, and all shall be revealed.","ditemid":100361,"eventtime":"2009-08-18 20:01:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":202,"picture_keyword":"tiger","taglist":"a game of thrones, hbo","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":125,"current_music":"Lovin' Spponful","commentalter":1296105789,"personifi_tags":"18:11,6:11,8:5,10:5,11:11,36:5,43:5,3:22,24:5,25:22,26:11,9:22,21:11,14:11,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-08-19 02:12:55","anum":9,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100361.html","event_timestamp":1250625660,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/92415067/21423069","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100361.html?replyto=6881033","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100361.html?thread=6881033#t6881033","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100361.html?thread=6881033#t6881033","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100361.html?thread=6881033#t6881033","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jaimee2","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jaimee2.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6881033,"talkid":26879,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/100361.html?thread=6881033#t6881033","upictitle":"Jaimee: pic#92415067","article":"No sweat we'll be here.

On a positive note, I finally got my girlfriend to read 'Thrones', so I am no longer the only fiend in the house. I understand everyone's desire to satisfy their curiosity but come on people! With how long we've been waiting and aching for 'Dance' this by comparison is a walk in the park. You heard the big man himself say when they hope to start filming, so how much longer could they possibly play this close to the chest? (I really hope I didn't just jinx us all)<br />I find in life that if you keep low expectations...or expect the worst, it's a little more difficult to be disappointed. Willing the announcement sooner or time to magically jump to the beautiful day that 'Dance' finally comes out will leave one as satisfied and well adjusted as Cersei. <br />I'll still fantasize about them casting Atia(Polly Walker) as Melisindra though.( Too bad no sex scenes in the series with her so far)<br />Oh, who am I kidding?
