{"itemid":1627,"subject":"Home Again","event":"Got back last night from Seattle.\r\n\r\nNorwescon was a lot of fun.  I got to hang with some old friends and made some new ones, and drank far too many White Russians.  (The Dude abides).  My hosts treated me very well.  \r\n\r\nI read the new 'Alayne' chapter, the one I just uploaded, and got a great response.  I'm very pleased that so many of you liked it.  (I've gotten some nice emails about it too.  Sorry that I cannot reply, but there are just too many).\r\n\r\nThe con also featured a Burlesque show with a GAME OF THRONES theme.  That was fun too.  \r\n\r\nThe Philip K. Dick awards were given out.  I haven't actually read any of the finalists, but a couple of the winners were present, and I was pleased to meet them.  \r\n\r\nThis year's Hugo ballot was also announced, simultaneously with similar announcements at Minicon and the British Eastercon.  I am going to have more to say about that soon.  A lot more.  But not in this post.  I don't want to spoil the mood here.\r\n\r\nFandom Is (indeed) a Way of Life, and attending a con like Norwescon always feels like coming home.\r\n\r\nOh, and once more, for all the Seahawks fans I met this weekend... <b><i>THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE BALL TO BEAST MODE.</i></b>  Worst.  Call.
