{"itemid":12,"subject":" Remember the Hugo","event":"Just popping up with a quick reminder that Hugo nominations close on Friday.  \r\n\r\n Many people vote for the Hugo Awards.  Relatively few nominate.  If you would like your voice to be heard, this is your chance.  You do have to be a member of either the last worldcon (Glasgow) or the next one (LA).  You can even nominate online, at http://laconiv.org/2006/hugos/hugoform.htm. \r\n\r\n I made some suggestions as to worthy nominees a couple of posts down.  Your own favorites may be very different.  No matter.  Nominate.  The Hugo Award is only as meaningful as we make it.\r\n\r\n I've been intending to post a report on my recent trip to Boskone and New York, but as usual I have been swamped since I got back.  Maybe in the next day or so.  It was a great trip, though.  Boskone was fun, as ever, and the week in NYC was as exciting as it was exhausting.  All sorts of interesting new books and projects are in the wind, and I expect I'll be telling you about some of them when and if they become real.  \r\n\r\n (And no, I am NOT going to forget about A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.  That's still my number one priority, and will remain so until it's done).","ditemid":3152,"eventtime":"2006-03-07 23:22:00","props":{},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2006-03-08 07:00:31","anum":80,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/3152.html","event_timestamp":1141773720,"reply_count":0}
