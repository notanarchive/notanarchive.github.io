That sound you heard was me choking and sputtering.\r\n\r\nMy Jets have given up two perfectly good draft picks for Tim Tebow, the worst quarterback in the National Football League.\r\n\r\nGak.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell are they thinking over there at Gang Green central?\r\n\r\nMark Sanchez is not, as yet, Eli Manning, but he is a talented quarterback with a good arm and he completes more than fifty per cent of his passes, none of which can be said for Tebow.  The last thing he needs is a stadium full of Timomaniacs screaming for Tebow every time a pass falls incomplete.  The divisions in the Jets locker room last season were well documented.  THis is just going to make those problems a thousand times worse.\r\n\r\nNor do I think that Tebow's conspicuous piety will play well in the Big Apple.  This is the city that once embraced Broadway Joe.  Tebow would fit better in... well, if Branson, Missouri had an NFL team, that would be a perfect fit.","ditemid":274213,"eventtime":"2012-03-21 11:42:00","props":{"current_location":"topsy turvy land","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":127,"commentalter":1333531404,"give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs down","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":7,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-03-21 17:42:32","anum":37,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html","event_timestamp":1332330120,"reply_count":124,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116571229/47699133","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html?replyto=15705893","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html?thread=15705893#t15705893","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html?thread=15705893#t15705893","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html?thread=15705893#t15705893","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html?thread=15705893#t15705893","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1119004","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/travis.hamer","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15705893,"talkid":61351,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/274213.html?thread=15705893#t15705893","upictitle":"Travis Hamer: pic#116571229","article":"That Tebow led his team to the playoffs and won a playoff game last year.

G: pic#116583190","article":"Mark Sanchez is the captain of a squad of goblin pirates.  They're quite good, but the lands they inhabit are shared with other pirates who have achieved greater and more glorious success.  While there's loyalty amongst the crew, they're still goblin pirates, and there is still an inordinate amount of grumbling, in-fighting, and potential back-stabbing.  <br /><br />Earlier this year, Sanchez was summoned before the Council, and deemed worthy of his rank and status and told to continue his missions.  However, the Council has now told him they're bringing in Tebow, a \"backup Captain,\" in case Sanchez falters.  As if that weren't enough, the backup Captain is largely considered a joke by the other squads.  His plans of battle are laughable and fail (hard) 95% of the time.  But, strangely, he comes out with a head-scratching last-minute victory far more often than people would expect.  To top it all off, he's not even a goblin, but an elf!  One of those stoic, humble, overly-spiritual elves who cries in defeat, but also cries in victory.
