{"itemid":25,"subject":"Off to Worldcon","event":"It has been an interesting few days, to say the least.  I never dreamed my posts here would get such an overwhelming response.  Thanks for all the comments, pro and con.  I appreciate the support, and even the thoughtful and reasoned responses from many who disagree with me.  As for the handful who chose to chant cant or throw insults... you should be ashamed of yourselves.\r\n\r\nNo politics this time.  I'm packing right now.  Tomorrow morning I'm off, first to Albuquerque for Bubonicon, our friendly little local convention, and then on Monday to LA for worldcon.  Let us all hope that no new crisis intervenes, so that I am allowed to board the airplane.  I will try to resist the urge to go \"baaaaa, baaaaaa, baaaaaa\" as I pass through the metal detector.\r\n\r\nI love worldcon, and this year should be a good one.  Aside from being in Anaheim (not my favorite part of LA), the convention facility is a great one, really well set up for parties, and the Brotherhood Without Banners is promising to pull out all the stops this time around.  \r\n\r\nOn other fronts, I should mention that we have just added a new stop to my ICE DRAGON promotional schedule.  On Tuesday, September 26, I will be signing at the River Lights Bookstore in Dubuque, Iowa.  Full details will soon be posted to the Appearances page on my website.  I lived in Dubuque for three years (1976 - 1979)a long, long, long time ago, but have only been back there once in the last twenty-six years, and that only briefly, so I am looking forward to seeing my old haunts again.  I hope the place hasn't changed as much as my old neighborhood in Chicago had when I went back there in May.\r\n\r\nAnd to appease all those who come to my site mainly for updates about A DANCE WITH DRAGONS... sorry, guys, you're not going to like this news any more than I do, but the last month has been a washout as far as writing is concerned.  My home renovations have been very distracting, all sorts of other things have been breaking or demanding my attention, there were tax records to prepare for my accountant (I had to take an extension last April), and it seems as if every day has been full of crises and interruptions.  I do hope the worst is behind me, however, and that I can plunge back into the book when I get back from LA.  I need to make certain that September is a more productive month than August.    \r\n\r\nI do intend to continue to speak out on political issues from time to time, but perhaps not at such length as I have these past few days.  It has been fun, and invigorating, and even enlightening in parts, but it takes time and energy, and just now I need to save most of my time and energy for A DANCE WITH DRAGONS and WILD CARDS and my myriad other publishing projects, old and new.","ditemid":6493,"eventtime":"2006-08-17 22:11:00","props":{"commentalter":1168962025,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2006-08-18 04:38:46","anum":93,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html","event_timestamp":1155852660,"reply_count":179,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/88602562/8018181","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?replyto=486749","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=486749#t486749","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=486749#t486749","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=486749#t486749","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"terraprime","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://terraprime.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":486749,"talkid":1901,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=486749#t486749","upictitle":"terraprime: Shut Up","article":"Hi George. I didn't post any comments on the last two entries because I didn't have anything to say that hasn't been said already by the time I saw the entries. At any rate, I just want to say that as far as I'm concerned, someone who is engaged in the real world is more worthy of respect than a recluse who simply types out manuscript pages. So kudos for staying engaged and sharing your thoughts. The book will be done when it'll be done, is my thinking. I want to find out what happens next, of course, but another month or two of waiting isn't going to shatter my world. <br /><br />Plus, it is summer. So there.<br /><br />Have a good trip out. The BwB people are all psyched for the Con. I won't be in LA, but I'm hoping I'll catch you on the midwest tour later, either at ArchCon or at Dubuque*. <br /><br /><br /><br /><i>*Incidentally, my partner and I drive down to various parts of IA around Dubuque for family events regularly, and every time we pass Galina I always thought of [u]Fevre Dream[/u] and steamboats and vampires.</i>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"August 18 2006, 04:48:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://terraprime.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"terraprime","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"terraprime","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://terraprime.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"terraprime","ctime_ts":1155876535,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/803070/58869","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?replyto=499549","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=499549#t499549","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=499549#t499549","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=499549#t499549","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"odiedragon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://odiedragon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":499549,"talkid":1951,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=499549#t499549","above":486749,"upictitle":"Odie: sunset","article":"If you need a ride to Dubuque let me know... we may be able to arrange something.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"August 18 2006, 12:05:59 UTC","parent":486749,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://odiedragon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"odiedragon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"odiedragon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://odiedragon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"odiedragon","ctime_ts":1155902759,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/16058561/803796","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?replyto=487005","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=487005#t487005","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=487005#t487005","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=487005#t487005","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=487005#t487005","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aergern","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aergern.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":487005,"talkid":1902,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/6493.html?thread=487005#t487005","upictitle":"Valar Morghulis: constantine","article":"As far as ADwD is concerned.. better you do it right then to do it badly.
