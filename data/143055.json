In a social situation, I'd much rather talk about NFL football, or recent films, or where to get the best pizza in town, or collecting toy knights, or your favorite author (so long as it's not me), or comic books, or... well, really, almost anything except your fantasy world.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 1 2010, 05:51:17 UTC","parent":9535695,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: A Fan approaches you to chat during downtime,...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1270101077,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?replyto=9535951","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9535951#t9535951","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9535951#t9535951","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9535951#t9535951","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tungsai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tungsai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9535951,"talkid":37249,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9535951#t9535951","upictitle":"tungsai: pic#94473302","article":"Do you accept gifts from fans during these types of events, assuming the gift is appropriate (and small enough for carry-on)?<br /><br />I have some really good Chinese Tea...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 1 2010, 04:37:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Another question;","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tungsai.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tungsai","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tungsai","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tungsai.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"tungsai","ctime_ts":1270096659,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?replyto=9536719","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9536719#t9536719","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9536719#t9536719","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9536719#t9536719","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9536719,"talkid":37252,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/143055.html?thread=9536719#t9536719","above":9535951,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I often fly to these events, and some of the gifts I am given are not the sort of thing one can take on an airplane in this benighted age.
