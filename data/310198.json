{"itemid":1211,"subject":"A Dangerous Delivery","event":"The women are coming, and they're armed and dangerous.\r\n\r\nGardner Dozois and I have just delivered our latest massive crossgenre anthology, DANGEROUS WOMEN (originally FEMMES FATALE), to our editors at Tor.  This one is our biggest yet... yes, even more massive that WARRIORS (though still well short of the length my fantasy writers), with another all-star lineup of bestselling and award-winning contributors.\r\n\r\nThe table of contents will look like this:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION, by Gardner Dozois\r\nSOME DESPERADO, by Joe Abercrombie\r\nMY HEART IS EITHER BROKEN, by Megan Abbott\r\nNORA’S SONG, by Cecelia Holland\r\nTHE HANDS THAT ARE NOT THERE, by Melinda Snodgrass\r\nBOMBSHELLS, by Jim Butcher\r\nRAISA STEPANOVA, by Carrie Vaughn\r\nWRESTLING JESUS, by Joe R. Lansdale\r\nNEIGHBORS, by Megan Lindholm\r\nI KNOW HOW TO PICK ‘EM, by Lawrence Block\r\nSHADOWS FOR SILENCE IN THE FORESTS OF HELL, by Brandon Sanderson\r\nA QUEEN IN EXILE, by Sharon Kay Penman\r\nTHE GIRL IN THE MIRROR, by Lev Grossman\r\nSECOND ARABESQUE, VERY SLOWLY, by Nancy Kress\r\nCITY LAZARUS, by Diana Rowland\r\nVIRGINS, by Diana Gabaldon\r\nHELL HATH NO FURY, by Sherilynn Kenyon\r\nPRONOUNCING DOOM, by S.M. Stirling\r\nNAME THE BEAST, by Sam Sykes\r\nCARETAKERS, by Pat Cadigan\r\nLIES MY MOTHER TOLD ME, by Caroline Spector\r\nTHE PRINCESS AND THE QUEEN, by George R.R. Martin\r\n \r\nThe Abercrombie is set against his RED COUNTRY backdrop, the Holland gives us Eleanor of Aquitaine, Jim Butcher returns us to Harry Dresden's world, Lev Grossman contributes a tale of life at Brakebills, Steve Stirling revisits his Emberverse, Diana Gabaldon's story features Jamie Fraser of OUTLANDER fame, the Spector is a Wild Cards story featuring Hoodoo Mama and the Amazing Bubbles, and mine own contribution... well, it's some of that fake history I have been writing lo these many months, the true (mostly) story of the origins of the Dance of the Dragons.  The stand-alone stories, not part of any series, feature some amazing work as well.  For those who like to lose themselves in long stories, the Brandon Sanderson story, the Diana Gabaldon story, the Caroline Spector story, and my \"Princess and Queen\" are novellas.  Huge mothers.  \r\n\r\nThis one took longer than we thought it would, mostly because of me (mea culpa), but Gardner and I think you'll find that it was worth the wait.  Some terrific tales await you.  No pubdate yet, of course... this bulletin is hot off the press... but as soon as we get word from Tor, you guys will be the first to know.\r\n \r\n((Hurrah!  Another monkey off my back!!))","ditemid":310198,"eventtime":"2013-01-22 15:18:00","props":{"taglist":"tor,
