{"itemid":107,"subject":"Pathetic","event":"... and has no purpose.\r\n\r\nPathetic loss by the Giants.  They played without heart or guts, lost to an inferior Redskins team, and may be well on their way to another end-of-season collapse.  Eli looked mediocre at best, but got no help from his receivers, who were dropping balls all over the field.  Special mention goes to the normally sure-handed Amani Toomer, who dropped what would have been a long gainer while wide open, to Brandon Jacobs, who ran well but proved that he can't catch anything out of the backfield, even when the ball hits him in his hands, and to Sinorice Moss, who twice caught crucial passes at a distance that would have been good for a first down and then ran backwards so they weren't first downs after all.\r\n\r\nPfui.\r\n\r\nIf the Giants lose to Buffalo next week, they won't even make the playoffs.  I will not be at all surpised if that happens.","ditemid":27541,"eventtime":"2007-12-16 21:59:00","props":{"current_moodid":97,"commentalter":1198213975,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-12-17 05:05:00","anum":149,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html","event_timestamp":1197842340,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119744567/7312115","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?replyto=2891157","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2891157#t2891157","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2891157#t2891157","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2891157#t2891157","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"linnai","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://linnai.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2891157,"talkid":11293,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2891157#t2891157","upictitle":"Linnai Commune: â‚ª - bokeh//spider silk and dewdrops","article":"I just wished to mention that as a favorite writer of mine, I LOVE posts of this nature from you.

Having been raised as a Red Sox fan, I'm very conflicted about the fact that, in football, I am essentially rooting for the Yankees.  Of course, I love that my teams (in just about every sport) are so dominant right now.  But I understand that it won't always be that way, and I am disappointed by my fellow Patriots fans who don't seem to understand that trumpeting our team's success just creates enmity with other football fans.  I'm enjoying this remarkable season, but I don't see the need to be a jerk about it.<br /><br />As for your teams, the world isn't really at an end.  The Jets are a much better team than their record shows, and if they fix their line play, they'll be right back in the mix in the next few years.  The Giants (and especially Eli) are inconsistent, but they have a solid enough lead to make the playoffs no matter what happens over the next two weeks.  Still, winning against Buffalo would make things a bit more relaxing for them before they have to play the Pats.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"December 18 2007, 02:52:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mshea.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mshea","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mshea","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mshea.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mshea","ctime_ts":1197946366,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109915172/10560429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?replyto=2919317","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2919317#t2919317","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2919317#t2919317","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2919317#t2919317","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nycfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2919317,"talkid":11403,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27541.html?thread=2919317#t2919317","above":2913941,"upictitle":"nycfalcon: pic#109915172","article":"Comfortable lead?

While many of those 'easy' tosses seemed like they should have been caught,in strong cold wind they become hardly routine. Ask Phil Simms. The art or rather science of passing in those conditions demand a tight spiral with the nose of the ball as horizontal as possible (do you remember how many of Phil's passes were knocked down at the line of scrimmage?) And, to make it even easier on your receivers who's hands and reflexes were no doubt a bit numbed and slowed you have to as a passer be consistent.  The fault lies squarely on the shoulders of the Giant brass who refuse to admit that Eli will never be a good QB especially in cold weather.<br /><br />Eli needs to be benched and Coughlin needs to be fired. I admit a bit of an over-reaction, but I've had it with those guys. And while I'm ranting what was going on with the linebackers? Talk about being a day late and a dollar short.<br /><br />Maybe global warming is to blame. The team has been spoiled by balmy weather and don't understand Giant Stadium football anymore. Or, maybe even they need better door management.<br /><br />Well, the Viking looked good.
