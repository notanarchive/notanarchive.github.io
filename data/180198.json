{"itemid":703,"subject":"One More Game","event":"Life is magical... but kind of crazed at the moment.\r\n\r\nI am off to Ireland at the crack of dawn tomorrow, but I took the morning off from packing and the usual last-minute madness to watch the Giants game, a thoroughly dominating win over the Houston Texans on their home turf.  Don't have the time or energy to post about this one in detail... but the game was not nearly as close as I expected.  The Giants D looked awesome.  Not as many sacks as against the Bears, but they kept the pressure on Texan QB Matt Schaub all game, and completely shut down the NFL's leading rusher (he won't be leading after this week, I think).  The offense looked pretty good too, except for two awful (and completely unnecessary) picks by ELi in the third quarter.  Great game from Hakeem Nicks.  For some reason the Texans never seemed to cover him.\r\n\r\nThat's it for football for me until mid-November.  TIVO will record all the games between then and now for me to watch when I get back.\r\n\r\nAnd now I'm off to ravage Eire and besiege Malta.

The town sized city of Valletta has the most amazing walls I've ever seen, simply a marvel of engineering by way of thanks to the Knights of St. John. Some tremendous history going on there as well with the Ottoman invasion which led directly to the building of Valletta.

This may seem patently ridiculously, but I am writing to warn you to not take your next game lying down.<br /><br />The good old boys from Detroit, dare I say, are not looking like the decade-long shades of their former pushover selves.  <br /><br />Even without our franchise quarterback for all but one half of one game, we have been competitive in all but one game, and are fresh off a good old fashioned wood shedding of the St. Louis Rams.  That, in and of itself, isn't terribly impressive considering (according to last years draft order) the Rams were statistically the only team worse than the Lions, but let us not forget their upset of the 'Skins, and the overall impressive play of their rookie franchise quarterback.  In fact, the Rams entered the game on top of their division, and left with with a sore ass to the tune of a THIRTY-EIGHT point drumming!<br /><br />With your pass rush and Staffords ailing shoulder, it is certain that Shaun Hill will be starting for us against you.  He has been very impressive in his spot starts, and will lead an attack equipped with a top flight WR, two capable TE's, and a RB that is in discussion for Offensive Rookie of the Year.<br /><br />On the other side of the ball, we will send Vander Bosch and the runaway leader thusfar for Defensive Rookie of the Year, Suh, to rattle what is, at times, an oh-so-shaky Eli.  Gods, I hope we can get home with them, because if not, Nicks has a very good chance of exposing our greatest weekness- our secondary.<br /><br />Either way, it should be a far better and far closer game than I think alot of people expect.  Unlike in the past where I considered it nothing short of a miracle on the VERY few occasions the Lions would actually win, I now feel like we have a chance - not a great one, but a chance none the less- to sneak one out.  <br /><br />Unfortunately, by the time this post reaches you - sometime in mid-Novemeber, I guess- we will likely be talking about the Lions mid-20-something road losing streak (they may break their own record!), and I will just be one more crackpot from Detroit guilty as we always are of getting drunk from too much of the old Lions Koolaid.
