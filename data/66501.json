{"itemid":259,"subject":"Grumpy Old Phan","event":"So I'm watching ESPN this morning and they've got a story about the upcoming playoff game between the Ravens and the Titans.  Ravens rookie QB Joe Flacco has been given a nickname by his teammates, the reporter announces -- \"Joe Cool.\"\r\n\r\nPfui.  I have nothing against Joe Flacco, who seems to be a promising young talent, but why can't this new generation of NFL players make up their own fraking nicknames???  There's only one Joe Cool, and his last name was Montana, not Flacco.\r\n\r\nAnd while I am on the subject, there's only one LT, and he was a linebacker for the New York Giants, not the oft-injured running back for that team in San Diego.\r\n\r\nNext thing we know, ESPN will be telling us that some wet-behind-the-ears young kids just out of college want to be called \"Night Train\" and \"Crazylegs.\"  Well, I saw it's spinach and I say the hell with it.\r\n\r\nThe commish needs to start slapping big fines on these clowns for inappropriate misappropriation of nicknames.","ditemid":66501,"eventtime":"2009-01-07 11:08:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":179,"current_moodid":95,"commentalter":1233637706,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1231352205},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-01-07 18:15:14","anum":197,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66501.html","event_timestamp":1231326480,"reply_count":85,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116514491/10033948","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66501.html?replyto=4981445","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66501.html?thread=4981445#t4981445","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66501.html?thread=4981445#t4981445","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66501.html?thread=4981445#t4981445","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"anti_laura","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://anti-laura.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4981445,"talkid":19458,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/66501.html?thread=4981445#t4981445","upictitle":"The Anti-Laura: pic#116514491","article":"Should've gone with Joe Camel.

I have been a football fan my whole life. As someone who for awhile thought the league was too harsh on these players who celebrate, I am totally flip flopping on the issue after these last couple of years. People like Chad Johnson don't shut up while there teams are being descimated. I am not a patriots fan but to see Wes Welker who I like a lot get fined TEN GRAND for a snow angel while half the league get's away with what you said and more I am dumbfounded. White shoes, Bradshaw and the first Joe Cool IMO, Joe Namath all had celebrations and names both earned and approaite. But lately, last week in fact I saw it twice, players celebrating after a first down or sack when there teams are losing, and losing big. Its awful and someone needs to teach these kids that football is the ultimate TEAM GAME, even the lowest players need to play a team game or your team loses and these absurd nicknames and dances, when players are losing, not playing or not earning it, is awful.
