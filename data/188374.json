{"itemid":735,"subject":"Feetsball","event":"Back at home with the NFL.  But weekends like this wear me out.\r\n\r\nThe Jets game was a horror.  Bad enough that they lost to a mediocre Miami team they should have dominated.  It was how they lost.  Sanchez seems to have reverted to his rookie ways, throwing INTs every time he had the ball.  Santonio dropped a sure TD.  I think the Patriots game has robbbed Gang Green of their mojo, which does not bode well for the remainder of the season, with the Steelers and the Bears coming up.  I am starting to have flashbacks to the great collapse of '86.  Rex, Rex, work your magic, I can't take that again.\r\n\r\nAs for Big Blue, well, the Giants thumped a lifeless Vikings team playing without Brett Favre.  The defense and the running game looked good.  Eli, not so much.  Two terrible INTs right out of the box.  And now we have to play the Eagles on a short week.  We haven't beaten the Eagles in what seems like decades.  Time to end that streak.  But if Eli keeps throwing the ball to guys in the wrong color jersey, it won't be easy.","ditemid":188374,"eventtime":"2010-12-14 19:19:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"G-men","taglist":"nfl","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":134,"commentalter":1294257344,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-12-15 02:19:08","anum":214,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html","event_timestamp":1292354340,"reply_count":38,"comments":[{"collapsed":1,"shown":0,"uname":"blanx73","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://blanx73.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11493334,"talkid":44895,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?thread=11493334#t11493334","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"6 years ago","poster":"grrm","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://blanx73.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"blanx73","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"blanx73","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://blanx73.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"blanx73","ctime_ts":1292380673,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?replyto=11493590","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?thread=11493590#t11493590","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?thread=11493590#t11493590","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?thread=11493590#t11493590","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?thread=11493590#t11493590","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11493590,"talkid":44896,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/188374.html?thread=11493590#t11493590","above":11493334,"upictitle":"George R.R.
