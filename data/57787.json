{"itemid":225,"subject":"Double Your Pleasure","event":"Life is magical and full of joy.\r\n\r\nGreat wins today by both the Jets and Giants, though the two games could not have been more different.  Gang Green absolutely destroyed the Rams, leading 40-0 at the half, and coasting to an easy 47-3 victory.  This year's incarnation of the Rams look truly pathetic, true, but in the years past the Jets have shown a tendency to play down to the level of their opponents and lose such games.  Years past?  No, make that weeks past.  The loss to Oakland just a few weeks back still rankles.  Anyway, it did not happen this week, and the Jets look primed and ready for Thursday's big showdown with the Patriots for first place in the AFC East.\r\n\r\nThe Giants game was a whole different animal.  Their annual contests with the Eagles are always hard-fought, and this was no exception.  The G-Men dominated yardage and time of possession with their monstrous three-headed running game, but somehow they could never quite put the Iggles away, so the decision came down to the final two minutes of the fourth.  It was a sloppy game, marked by lots of turnovers (I love Brandon Jacobs, but I hope Coughlin tells him to stop trying to jump over tacklers.  He does much better when he just plows into them), but a damned exciting one.  My heart was in my throat as time ran down, until the Giants defense stuffed Westbrook on those two final runs, and settled the matter.  Replay challenges played a huge role in the outcome as well -- one crucial one by Coughlin, which he won, and two foolish ones by Andy Reid, both of which he lost.\r\n\r\nA win is a win, though, and the Giants now sit at 8-1, with a commanding lead in the NFC East.  Their schedule only gets harder from here, though.  Next week it's the Ravens with that brutal defense of theirs.  Should be another great game, for those who like D.","ditemid":57787,"eventtime":"2008-11-10 00:01:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":340,"current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1226596679,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-11-10 07:14:31","anum":187,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html","event_timestamp":1226275260,"reply_count":42,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/81733719/731384","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?replyto=4529595","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529595#t4529595","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529595#t4529595","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529595#t4529595","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"infinite_hiatus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4529595,"talkid":17693,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529595#t4529595","upictitle":"Tyson: SOIAF","article":"Giants are playing better than last year, and that season ended pretty well.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"November 10 2008, 07:18:09 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"infinite_hiatus","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"infinite_hiatus","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://infinite-hiatus.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"infinite_hiatus","ctime_ts":1226301489,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/94114563/8940309","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?replyto=4529851","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529851#t4529851","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529851#t4529851","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529851#t4529851","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529851#t4529851","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bojojoti","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bojojoti.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4529851,"talkid":17694,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/57787.html?thread=4529851#t4529851","upictitle":"bojojoti: Magic Camera","article":"I expect the KC Chiefs to lose every game, but I'm encouraged by Thigpen's performance.

The Giants ascension reminds of a lot of the beginning of the Pats dynasty:<br /><br />     a.) A come from behind Super Bowl win versus a seemingly unbeatable opponent. <br /><br />     b.) A talented QB's rise to statistical stardom.<br /><br />     c.) A crusty, misunderstood coach finding redemption. <br /><br />2.) My second thought is that I believe most of the Super Bowl winners of the 90s would crush the Super Bowl winners of the 2000s. However, watching the Giants, particularly their offensive and defensive lines, I think they'd give the Cowboys, Niners, Broncos teams of the 90s a run for their money.

The Giants look like a team with very few weaknesses who have a tremendous chance to repeat.  Their running game is just awesome.  <br /><br />On the flipside, what is up with Andy Reid's decision making in the fourth?  Concerning the first challenge he made, I think that Al Michaels was being very generous by calling it a challenge of \"desperation\".  It was just plain stupid.  There was a lot of time left in the game and Jacobs was 100% down before the ball came out to anybody who has even decent vision, much less a coach with eyes and ears all around him to advise him on what to do.  The second challenge on the touchdown fumble was a lot more understandable but the bottom line is those two timeouts may have given the Eagles one last gasp at the end.  <br /><br />The fourth down call Reid made to run instead of pass was mind-boggling as well.  I've always thought Reid was a very intelligent coach, but he deserves all the criticism the Philly people throw his way this week after those decisions.  And I totally agree, Jacobs needs to stay on the ground.  He can run over almost anyone he doesn't scare out of his way, and aside from making himself vulnerable to fumble when he does those leaps, he just looks silly.  <br /><br />I truly hope that with Tony Romo, Felix Jones, and hopefully Terrence Newman coming back soon the wild card race within this division will only get more exciting (as of now, it looks like your G-Men have the division to lose).  It all hinges on Sunday at the Skins for my Boys, though.  If we lose that game the season is over.  If we go into D.C. and get the win, there's a great chance we'll be 8-4 by Thanksgiving Day and ready for the December gauntlet.
