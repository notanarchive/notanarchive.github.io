{"itemid":473,"subject":"Thursday Night Lights","event":"Life is magical and full of... uh... a tiny teeny bit of hope?\r\n\r\nThe Jets beat the Bills of Buffalo last night in Toronto, which was good.  Defense looked awesome, especially Darrell Revis, who completely shut down that loudmouth TO.  Offense, not so much.  And things got even worse on the offensive side of the ball when Mark Sanchez dove for a first down and hurt his OTHER knee, the one not already in a brace.  Really, he's taking this \"following in the footsteps of Joe Namath\" thing too far.  Kellen Clemens looked awful in relief.  If Sanchez is seriously hurt, Gang Green is done.  \r\n\r\nAnd if not... well, there's still a slim chance we could make the playoffs.  All we'd need to do is sweep our last four games, including the undefeated Colts and red-hot Bengals.  That's going to happen, sure.  Uh-huh.  \r\n\r\nBut Rex does have the defense playing lights out, so that's something.","ditemid":121245,"eventtime":"2009-12-04 12:07:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":162,"taglist":"nfl","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1296105737,"interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"16:25,17:25,3:12,18:12,25:12,39:25,9:12,10:12,13:25,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-04 19:07:16","anum":157,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121245.html","event_timestamp":1259928420,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121245.html?replyto=8081565","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121245.html?thread=8081565#t8081565","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121245.html?thread=8081565#t8081565","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121245.html?thread=8081565#t8081565","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vorsayo","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vorsayo.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8081565,"talkid":31568,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121245.html?thread=8081565#t8081565","article":"Hope your Jets down the Colts but no way i can support them against my home town team the Bengals lol.
