It's called \"ReOpen The Princess & The Queen, or The Dying of the Dragons\", by a guy called Ythier The Drunken.<br /><br />There is three different part in it.<br /><br />First part seems to be an annoted version of Archmaester Gyldayn's \"The Princess and The Queen, or, The Blacks and The Greens - Being A History of the Causes, Origins, Battles, and Betrayals of that Most Tragic Bloodletting Known as the Dance of the Dragons\" made by a guy who call himself Hugor Hill, and with others commentaries maid by Haldon Halfmaester. They claim that they reconstructed the fabled book called sometimes \"Blood and Fire\" and sometimes<br />\"The Death of Dragons\", and that it was a book written by Archmaester Gyldayn. Did you hear about it? The only surviving copy of this one is supposedly hidden away in a locked vault<br />beneath the Citadel.<br /><br />Ythier the Drunken says he found this part on a boat called the Shy Maid, somewhere in Essos.<br /><br />Second part is from Ythier the Drunken himself, and is even weirder than the first part. He claimed to have seen a school of Grey Leviathans coming out of the Honeywine to share a haunch of boiled Grey mutton. And there is some very disturbing things about some specific archmaesters and maesters in it, and some historicals events.<br /><br />Last part is a cooking recipe by Hugor Hill, with two differents ingredients, a big one and a little one to seasoned it.<br /><br />Anyway, being from Lys, the common tong is not my native language, so I guess we could tell that the language tricked me, that I did not really understand what all these was about. I eat a lot of easter eggs reading it, and easter eggs made me hallucinate, seing dragons where there was not, that kind of things...<br /><br />Or maybe I did understood. Maybe this book, in the wrong hand, would be as dangerous as a sword.<br /><br />Could you tell me what to do with this manuscript? It's 15 000 words-long, and I guess a lot of people would like to read it. But peraphs, as Jaime Lannister told me once, that would spoil the mystery? I would hate to do that.<br /><br />Anyway, I would love to hear your thought about it. You can send me a raven here: desnouvellesdumonde@gmail.com<br /><br />Thanks for everything, your work is great.<br /><br />Maester Tyerry<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"April 21 2014, 05:04:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I found a weird book","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ThierrySoulard","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ThierrySoulard","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2545834","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70294694&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ThierrySoulard","ctime_ts":1398056691,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123219882/70294694","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/366912.html?thread=19033408#t19033408","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/366912.html?thread=19033408#t19033408","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/366912.html?thread=19033408#t19033408","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2545834","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ThierrySoulard","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19033408,"talkid":74349,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/366912.html?thread=19033408#t19033408","upictitle":"Thierry Soulard: pic#123219882","article":"Hello master,<br /><br />I'm re-rading books that I had for a long time with new eyes, and I find a lot of things who make me think I was a fool for a very long time.
