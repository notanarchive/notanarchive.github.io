{"itemid":16,"subject":"Belated Update","event":"I do have the best of intentions, honest. How hard can it be to update your blog regularly? Even when it&#39;s Not A Blog? Sigh. Too hard for me, it would seem. I know there are folks who do it every day, but...\r\n\r\nActually, I have added new entries to this journal half a dozen times since the last post you read here. In my head, anyway. It&#39;s just getting the words down on pap... er, phosphor... that proves to be the problem. Of course, getting the words down has always been the hard part. If it wasn&#39;t hard, everyone would be a writer.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see, I went to Marcon in Columbus, Ohio last month, did a few panels, read a chapter from A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, had some drinks with some of my readers. The Marcon folks were great hosts. On the way back, I stopped in Chicago to visit with my old friend and one-time collaborator Lisa Tuttle, who now lives in Scotland but was passing through Chicago herself on the way back from Wiscon. We had a great time catching up, and visited my favorite restaurant in the world, the Greek Islands in Greektown, where we ate flaming cheese and shouted &quot;Opaa!&quot; (There are some who will tell you that Oprah Winfrey has grown so huge in Chicago that the waiters in the Greektown eateries now shout &quot;Oprah!&quot; when they set the cheese on fire, but I can testify that it isn&#39;t true). I also took an el ride up to my old stomping grounds in Uptown one afternoon, and was startled by the changes. The apartments I lived in on Margate Terrace and Argyle are still there, but that&#39;s about it. The grocery stores I shopped in, the bar where I drank beer and played that high-tech videogame Pong, the newstand where I bought my comic books and the first issue of ANALOG to feature my story on the cover, the diners where I used to have my breakfast, even the friendly neighborhood titty bars where I used to... ah... do sociological research, all of them are gone. Argyle is nothing but Oriental groceries and Vietnamese restaurants now. The saddest part was seeing the boarded up ruins of the Uptown and Riviera movie houses, where I sat in the dark and saw so many films back in the early 70s. The Uptown in particular needs to be saved. It was one of Chicago&#39;s largest and grandest movie palaces. Anyway, after I got back, I figured I&#39;d write a trip report about Columbus and Chicago for Not A Blog. But I didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nHere in Santa Fe, our home renovations have been going ahead like... well, I was going to say, &quot;gangbusters,&quot; but &quot;housebusters&quot; would be more accurate. Three-quarters of what we own is in storage, and the construction crew has ripped the roof off our house, torn out the ceilings and most of the walls on floors two and one-and-a-half, filled several huge dumpsters with chunks of what used to be our home. They keep telling us they are going to put it all back together twice as nice as before, but some days I wonder. Meanwhile, Parris and I are living in my office across the street, which isn&#39;t nearly big enough for the two of us and Caligula and Augustus too. Another three months and it will all be done, they say. I hope so. I was thinking I would write a long piece for Not A Blog about the trials and tribulations of home renovation. But of course I didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nI have had various visitors since my last update here, most recently Howard Waldrop, who passed through on his way to the Rio Hondo writer&#39;s workshop in Taos, and again on the way back. Howard&#39;s visits never last long enough. He and I have known each other since 1963, when I bought BRAVE &amp; BOLD #28 from him (first JLA, donchaknow) for a quarter and we began to correspond. We were both in high school in those days, writing for comics fanzines. I was writing superhero stories in prose, and he was writing post-holocaust sword &amp; sorcery about a hero called The Wanderer and &quot;the Chronicles of Chim-Wazle.&quot; I keep telling Howard that I want that next Wanderer story, but he never listens. He&#39;s writing stuff about a guy named Tom Purdue instead... (or at least that&#39;s the story he told me to tell). I thought I might put something up here about Howard and his visit. But I didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, I am still writing superhero stories in prose. Or editing them, at least. One of the BIG news items since my last update here is the rebirth of WILD CARDS, which I am very excited about. The WILD CARDS series has been a part of my life since 1985 (though admittedly there was one seven-year hiatus in there), and some of the characters go all the way back to 1983, when some of the New Mexico gang created them for a RPG called SUPERWORLD. It&#39;s a world I love, and one I feared that I might have lost when our last publisher went bankrupt, but Tor Books stepped in and saved the day, and WILD CARDS is coming back bigger and better than ever, with new stories, new writers, and new characters. I thought about writing about that here, but instead I wrote about it for my News page. So go read the details there... and then go out and read a WILD CARDS book, please. I promise you, it&#39;s good stuff.\r\n\r\nParris and I saw Al Gore&#39;s AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH last week. It is a powerful and persuasive statement, and surprisingly entertaining, and Gore exudes so much warmth and intelligence that I still wonder how the country could have chosen George W. Bush instead in 2000... oh, wait, I forgot, we DIDN&#39;T! Just those rascals on the Supreme Court. Speaking of W (must we?), I see that when he was asked if he intended to see Gore&#39;s film, he replied, &quot;Doubt it,&quot; with one of his patented monkey smirks. You know, it is irritating enough that this president is so ignorant about so many things, but what really infuriates me is that he WALLOWS in his ignorance and seems to take great joy in it. No, of course he is not going to see AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH. He might have learned something. Anyway, I did think about writing some political stuff here. But I didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nI could go on. There were a whole bunch of other subjects I considered adding to Not A Blog. Some of them I even wrote in my head. (Ah, the stuff I write in my head... )\r\n\r\nOf course, judging by my emails, very few of you would have cared much about my visit to Chicago, or Howard&#39;s visit here, or my home renovations, or even global warming (you SHOULD care about global warming, however, and if you don&#39;t know why, go see the Gore film, Al explains it much better than I could). All my emails are about A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. I made the mistake of saying on my Update page that I would update again in April, and I didn&#39;t. Mea culpa. The thing is, I have posted several updates here, and I thought that would suffice, but it would appear that a good percentage of the folks who visit my website go straight to Update and never check out any of the other pages or links, including this one.\r\n\r\nI promise, I am going to update Update real soon now.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for those who do read this page... yes, I am still working on A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, and yes, I still hope to deliver it this fall, or by the end of the year at the latest.\r\n\r\nI also have other news about A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. A couple of things, actually, that I think will please and excite fans of the series. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t talk about them yet. Watch my News page, though. I should have a few big announcements in the next few months.\r\n\r\nI hope I will be back here for another Not A Blog before that. But I&#39;m not promising.","ditemid":4101,"eventtime":"2006-06-30 00:12:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"Spain","commentalter":1390980106,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"revtime":1390980134},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2006-06-30 07:11:01","anum":5,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html","event_timestamp":1151626320,"reply_count":75,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=6661#t6661","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=6661#t6661","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=6661#t6661","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6661,"talkid":26,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=6661#t6661","article":"I haven't seen Gores movie yet but I will.

President Bush is no exception.  An observation I've made (phrased in the form of an S.A.T. comprehension question) is that what tabloid reporters are to celebrities, celebrities often are to politicians (with about the same level of credibility).  Often what is said (or reported) is true (and to quote Obie Wan) \"from a certain point of view.\"  What you claim (or report) often depends on what you believe, what your motivations are, and who your audience is.  It seems that Mr. Martin's point of view is that the President needs a little culture, and since he's a Hollywood type (or was in a former life), the movies are as good a place as any to get that culture (from his point of view).  But ask yourself this question - do you want a president who takes 3-4 hours out of his day to go to a movie, or do you want a president who is on the clock 24-7 working on domestic and foreign issues?  Mr. Bush's plate is pretty full right at the moment, I want him on the clock.  In that regard I don't believe skipping a film is in any way, shape, or form \"wallowing in ignorance.\"  To the contrary, it might be ignorant to suggest he attend any film, yet alone one for which he'll be required to make statements about.  I don't necessarily agree with many things the President has done, but until we've walked a mile in his shoes, wouldn't our time be better spent pulling together as a country with positive suggestions and discussion rather than calling each other (as some children I know might say) \"dummy heads\" and \"fart eaters.\"<br /><br />And a personal note to Mr. Martin - With great power comes even greater responsibility.  Please don't let your passions influence the influential.  Rather choose the path of wisdon and offer suggestions, provide facts, and rely on your fellow Americans to come to their own conclusions.  United we stand, divided we fall.  If you want to be \"the man\" and unite us, put your name into the political arena and show us how it's done!  George RR for President.... George RR for President!  Then we'll be talking about \"RR\" on Crossfire rather than \"W\".<br /><br />I once got tired of parents griping about my officiating at a little league game (when I was 16) and offered to any parent in the crowd the opportunity to come down on the field, put on the equipment, and take the lousy $15/game salary.  Then I began calling them out by name and suggesting that their various unsavory quotes might make for a pretty interesting column in the local paper (that I occasionally wrote for).  No one accepted my position and we got about 40 more calls than the usual 2 or 3 regarding my column - most were parents claiming \"they'd sue\" if their names showed up.  My point was that these parents were inadvertenly influencing how their children behaved towards figures of authority - rather than offering their services as subject experts (on the subject of officiating) and calling their own children's games.  Rather than griping about politicians, I think might it be better to become one.  Take a few moments to read the Declaration of Independence if you've never done so.  Once you get through the rhetoric you'll recognize that \"fixing the problem\" is what our forefathers had in mind back in 1776.  I'm not speaking about open revolution.  I'm speaking about fixing problems rather than just stirring the pot.<br /><br />Of course all of these are opinions from my point of view.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"July 10 2006, 19:11:49

Martin called Sandkings.  My subsequent research led me to be very concerned, so much so that I developed an interdisciplinary major combinig meteorology and ecology.  Unfortunately, my AIM activities interfered with my studies at that time (I eventually got a law degree) but my interest in this topic has never waned.<br /><br />There is now no scientific doubt that global warming is real.  Whether humans significantly impact weather patterns is a different proposition to whether human activity has significantly impacted the climate.  (Humans, can and do impact upon weather patterns as well, but that is another debate).<br /><br />For the leader of a nation that is actively trying to make evry other nation on earth its clone, to sremain ignorant on a global issue is criminally negligent.  Before being labeled as a left wing ideologue, I should advise that I am in fact apolitical when it comes to left/right politics.<br /><br />As someone active in Indigenous Peoples issues, my politics are focussed on Tribal Sovereignty and following and protecting our land based spiritual beliefs.  In the Unites States, the President most sympathetic to my views in the 20th Century was a Republican by the name of Richard Nixon.  To many in Indian Country, Nixon has some redeeming qualities in terms of domestic policy.<br /><br />So, the question for me in relation to the current President Bush is not where he sits on the political spectrum.  It is where he sits on the intelligence/astuteness scale.  On that scale, the only President that ranks lower then GW Bush is R Reagan.  That they both happen to be Republicans is hopefully coincidental.  It is somewhat disturbing that both have served two terms, which raises some issues regarding the American public casting a majority vote for charismatic imbeciles.  There are a large number of Republicans that show a far greater understanding of issues then the current regime (McCain comes to mind).  The intelligence/astuteness scale is important.  Wiser minds might get into sticky situations, but they are far less likely to let them spiral out of control.  Like the continuing fence sitting regarding global warming, and those who want to dispute its reality.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"July 13 2006, 04:51:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Global Warming and Bush","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1152766270,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=34821#t34821","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=34821#t34821","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=34821#t34821","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":34821,"talkid":136,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=34821#t34821","article":"The previous entry was written by myself, Michael Lane, currently resident in Whakatane, Aotearoa (New Zealand).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"July 13 2006, 04:54:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Global Warming and Bush 2","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1152766489,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=35077#t35077","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=35077#t35077","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=35077#t35077","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":35077,"talkid":137,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=35077#t35077","article":"First off, let me say I enjoy your books (and your updates).

To my mind, very - VERY - few people can truly be open-minded when it comes to political discussions.  It is so very rare to see someone reply in the manner of \"I understand your position, but let me tell you my thoughts...\".  Instead almost all discussions start with \"How could you possibly be so ignorant?!?\" or some variation thereof.  <br /><br />This whole blog and it's replies are a perfect example.  The original blog entry started it by using deliberately provacative language like \"patented monkey smirks\".  How can you possibly ever hope to convince the other side of your views by immediately insulting them.  Of course, that comment was followed by boorish statements like Al Gore is a traitor, stabbed in the back, etc... - only to be followed by equally haughty replies that no one that leans to the right can possibly be intelligent, and even their music sucks!<br /><br />My point, if there is one, is that people don't know how to disagree.  Always insulting the other side is no way to have a conducive conversation, and only serves to further alienate each other.  I'm so sick of it - from both sides.  And my feeling is that the vast majority of Americans are sick of it too.  I'm tired of the Limbaughs and the Frankens, the Coulters and Michael Moores, the O'Reillys and Garfalos.

It's interesting to see the lies and decite of both parties, and the backstabbing and trash talking that takes place. It's pure entertainment to see who thinks which political parties ideology is better than the other one! Who's ideology is going to \"destroy\" our nation, and who's going to save it? I mean, I dont watch soap operas on TV, but the soap opera on Talk Radio is amazing to hear.<br /><br /> So many people are pissed off at Fox news because they dont fake their objectivity in their opinion pieces. They are a \"right\" leaning channel when it comes to Hannity and O'Riely and whoever else. I mean, Chris Matthews is pretty left, but does he even admit it? Then people use the fact of Fox not hiding behind masks as an opportunity to bash the rest of the channel. Ad hominim.  <br /><br />Anyway, I do happen to be one of Mr. Martins, \"...I have to admit I'm quite surprised that George has so many right wing wacko fans...\" right wing wako fan.

The neo cons are so hell bent on capitalistic gains and crushing the poor that all boyish dreams and fantasy is nil natta nothing? LOL!<br /><br />I am not surprised at all to be his fan.

I will likely watch it when it hits Netflix, but I am kind of interested in the science right now (mostly because of reading these posts).  I have spent a couple of hours looking for a meta-analyses on the subject but only come up with things like: A simulation of the effects of global warming: through the use of heat lamps on small patches of ground we found all over the country. (Please note the use of the obligatory colon) Though these papers may give a somewhat accurate account of what may occur when global warming happens, what I would like is something more specific to the \"why\" and \"how\" we are sure global warming is occurring. My question boils down to do they present any information on a meta-analysis of the global warming literature, or a non-partisan review of the literature.  I am always skeptical of issues of science/morality/ethics/politics presented by politicians on either side of the aisle.  Though I must say I am skeptical of the scientist as well, if for no other reason then lost of science is funded by government organizations.  There is of course the saving grace that science has scientific rigor, which is reported with findings, but you need to go to the sources. Oh last thing; a Meta analysis is a collection and distilling of all of the empirical scientific literature on a subject in order to come up with the absolute relative findings of the science to the inclusive dates.

His segments on the arctic and antarctic are very very clear examples of selective data presentation - if you go back 25-30 years, the Arctic is on a warming spell, bears and seals are threatened, the world is coming to an end as we know it.  If you go back 50 years, the Arctic's current climate variation is that it's still colder than it was during the Eisenhower administration.  If you go back 100 years, the Arctic climate NOW is colder than the average has been for more than 3/4 of the 20th century.<br /><br />Those giant glaciers crashing into the ocean on Antarctica lend one to the impression that the Antarctic ice sheets are disappearing at a precipitous rate.  Actual satellite monitoring of them from NOAA shows that the Antarctic ice sheet is A) currently growing both thicker and wider in its expanse, and B) that the likely cause of the dramatic footage is a shift in a warm water ocean current that goes through a 13 year cyclical variation.  <br /><br />The Mann Paper (MBH-98) got a lot of press with its \"hockey stick graph\".  It served as the frontspiece of the Kyoto treaty, and as a rallying cry for the \"We're all doomed!\" crowd.  <br /><br />Two scientists (McIntyre and McKittrick) attempted to replicate the Mann graph from the data sets provided for validation...and found that they couldn't, at all. The data sets weren't complete, and the parts that were there indicated a rate of total climate change that's less than 0.1% of what his paper documents.  Two of Mann's research assistants came forward and all but accused him of making up the data. Mann's research group promised a more complete set of data, delivered one that was \"more complete\" and showed a fair bit of evidence of tampering in favor of supporting a massive climate change from the results...and STILL didn't corroborate with the final published paper.<br /><br />This has gone on enough that Dr. Wegman was asked to chair an investigatory committee by Congress on the matter.<br /><br />His report can be read, in full, at:<br /><br />http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/home/0<wbr />7142006_Wegman_Report.pdf<br /><br />Certainly, if we're going to spend trillions of dollars on remedies to a problem, it's worth it to consider the exact nature of the problem first?<br /><br />One data point known in the scientific community for the better part of 20 years is that the bolometric luminisity (luminosity across all wavelengths) has gone up since accurate measures of record were first taken on Skylab....but that can't be used to get people to give up their cars, their spray cans of aerosol, and their sinful, consumptive lifestyles.<br /><br />Ken Burnside<br />Ad Astra Games<br

read most of your site, but haven't written to you yet because I don't want to be part of the river... oh well, now I'm sucked in.  Thanks for coming to Marcon; I enjoyed the panels, reading, etc.  I've finally gotten my husband to start the Ring, while I'm looking forward to the Dance.  I still want to see what happens to the \"Others.\"  Really, there's more in my head than just Ice and Fire, but where to start?  I commiserate with you about storing books; we moved in 2005, and I lost count of the boxes.  I'm from Ohio, the land where W had his thugs purge voting registrations of Ohio military serving in Iraq in 2004 because they were overseas and couldn't answer mail that said \"do not forward.\"  My daughter is having her fifth surgery Monday for a condition usually caused by the ever-present unregulated pollution... I saw lots of SCA friends at Marcon; at least I'll have that memory if I can't make it to Pennsic.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"July 26 2006, 21:32:13 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Read updates?","deleted":0,"dname":"","ctime_ts":1153949533,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=115717#t115717","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=115717#t115717","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=115717#t115717","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"irradiator99","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://irradiator99.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":115717,"talkid":452,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/4101.html?thread=115717#t115717","upictitle":"irradiator99: pic#0","article":"Mr. Martin, I truly admire your creativity and contributions to literature as well as to my own purely selfish reading pleasure. I even pried the cookie-cutter romance novels away from my mom, and gave her a copy of <i>A Game of Thrones</i> as few months ago...& now she pesters me for updates on when the latest will be released. Do take your time though. Quality counts, not speed.<br /><br />I'd like to recommend to everyone of a political bent; and more importantly, those who think politics is boring or irrelevant, a different, and likely much more eye-opening film: Aaron Russo's <i>America: Freedom to Fascism</i><br /><br />Russo was one of the Libertarian Party's candidates for prez last go 'round, but lost to Michael Badnarik in the primary. Neither had any chance in hell of winning, but either one would have embarrassed both the Democrat socialist John Kerry, and the Republican socialist Jorge W. Bush soundly in any debate...one of the reasons such an opportunity is not extended to the 3rd parties.<br /><br />I've not yet seen the film, but have heard Russo interviewed several times recently. I was going to post links to one...but it doesn't look like links are allowed HTML here, or maybe I'm doing something wrong.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"July 29 2006, 00:28:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Possible better use of movie viewing time...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://irradiator99.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"irradiator99","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"irradiator99","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://irradiator99.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"irradiator99","ctime_ts":1154132911,"tracked":0}]}
