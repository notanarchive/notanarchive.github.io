{"itemid":1127,"subject":"RIP, Harry Harrison","event":"We have lost another Grand Master, I fear.  I've just learned that Harry Harrison has died.\r\n\r\nI did not know Harry well, but I always liked him, and enjoyed his writing.  BILL THE GALACTIC HERO, THE TECHNICOLOR TIME MACHINE, DEATHWORLD (the first one is the best), THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT (ditto)...\r\n\r\nHe was a hard-drinking, fun-loving guy.  I remember him tending bar at the SFWA suite.  When you asked Harry for a gin and tonic, you got a tumbler of gin with a splash of tonic.  He kept his money on the Isle of Man, and would tell anyone who would listen that they should move their money there as well.  And back before the Brits reformed their currency, he was famous for insisting that all his UK contracts be paid in guineas rather than pounds.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Harry.  It was good reading you.","ditemid":288574,"eventtime":"2012-08-15 11:20:00","props":{"current_location":"santa fe","taglist":"writing","current_moodid":25,"commentalter":1345572203,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1346165634},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-08-15 17:20:44","anum":62,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288574.html","event_timestamp":1345029600,"reply_count":27,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114837188/5249729","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288574.html?thread=16489534#t16489534","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288574.html?thread=16489534#t16489534","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288574.html?thread=16489534#t16489534","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288574.html?thread=16489534#t16489534","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"brend_archer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://brend-archer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16489534,"talkid":64412,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/288574.html?thread=16489534#t16489534","article":"Harry was the first American author of science fiction that I read.
