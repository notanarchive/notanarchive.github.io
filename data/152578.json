{"itemid":596,"subject":"And Now For Something Completely Different...","event":"... on the theory that, sooner or later, we have to stop talking about fanfic.\r\n\r\nSo, let's see.  Casting is in full swing for the HBO series.  No one has been cast yet.  But I think we're getting close on a few roles.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at many audition tapes.  Varys.  Littlefinger.  Pyp.  Grenn.  Sam.  Ser Gregor.  Renly.  Bronn.  Septa Mordane.  Jory.  The Old Bear.  Even Marillion.  And probably some other characters that I've forgotten about, writing this off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nSome very hard choices await us.  For some parts, a wealth of great possibilities, and no way to go wrong.  For others, two or three strong contenders, then it tails off sharply.  For a few, we have yet to see anyone who excites us, so the search goes on.\r\n\r\nI've been asked if I will once again be giving \"hints\" when parts are cast.  Honest answer: I don't know.  I had fun with that last time around, and I think you guys did too.  (It astonished me how quickly you solved some of those puzzles).  But now that we have an actual series, HBO may very well want all casting announcements to come through them.  Or maybe they won't care.  In any case, he who pays the piper calls the tune, so I'll dance to whatever they play.\r\n\r\nTell you what, though... to save you guys the trouble of trying to parse every syllable of my posts here for hints and hidden meanings that do not exist, I will use a simple signal.  If I do add any posts with casting hints, I'll use my Froggy the Gremlin userpic.  If Froggy is not up there, then there are no hints in the post, so don't sweat it.  (This is pretty much what I did last time round, I'm just making it explicit).\r\n\r\nI think we're going to get some great people.","ditemid":152578,"eventtime":"2010-05-09 00:30:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":87,"commentalter":1352583824,"personifi_word_count":326,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"18:4,6:12,33:12,11:4,42:8,32:12,3:28,4:8,25:16,26:8,20:24,9:4,21:8,14:12"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-05-09 06:30:26","anum":2,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html","event_timestamp":1273365000,"reply_count":62,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html?replyto=9988610","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html?thread=9988610#t9988610","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html?thread=9988610#t9988610","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html?thread=9988610#t9988610","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html?thread=9988610#t9988610","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rarewind","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rarewind.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9988610,"talkid":39018,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/152578.html?thread=9988610#t9988610","article":"Littlefinger will be such a crucial role to cast.
