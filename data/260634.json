{"itemid":1018,"subject":"Two for the Edgar","event":"VERY cool...\r\n\r\nThe finalists for this year's Edgar Awards have just been announced, and I was thrilled to learn that two of the stories from DOWN THESE STRANGE STREETS, the fantasy/ mystery anthology that Gardner Dozois and I edited for Penguin, have been nominated for Best Short Story.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dr2ke/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dr2ke/s640x480\" width=\"317\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe nominees are:\r\n   \"Lord John and the Plague of Zombies,\" by Diana Gabaldon,\r\n                          and\r\n   \"The Adakian Eagle,\" by Bradley Denton. \r\n\r\nThe Edgar Awards, named after Edgar Allen Poe (that famous Baltimore Ravens fan), are the mystery equivalent of the Nebula, awarded annually by the members of the Mystery Writers of America.  It's quite a coup for a fantasy story to be nominated.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000kppt7/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000kppt7\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA full list of this year's Edgar nominees can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.theedgars.com/nominees.html\r\n\r\nCongratulations to Brad and Diana.  If you'd like to check out their stories, you can find DOWN THESE STRANGE STREETS on Amazon, or (I hope) at your favorite local bookshop.  Lots of other good stuff in the book as well.","ditemid":260634,"eventtime":"2012-01-20 11:20:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"anthologies, awards","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1327211269,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1327894378},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-01-20 18:24:06","anum":26,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260634.html","event_timestamp":1327058400,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93979269/13804587","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260634.html?thread=15283226#t15283226","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260634.html?thread=15283226#t15283226","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260634.html?thread=15283226#t15283226","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nparisi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nparisi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15283226,"talkid":59700,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/260634.html?thread=15283226#t15283226","article":"Nice.
