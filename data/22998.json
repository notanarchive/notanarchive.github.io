{"itemid":89,"subject":"Highs and Lows","event":"Another Sunday, and two more football games.  Sometimes it's good to have two teams.  The Giants are really on a roll, looking better with each game.  I'm especially pleased by the way their defense is playing.  Like any old-time Giants fan, I love defense, and the swarming four-headed sack monster the G-men are fielding with Osi, Kiwi, Strahan, and Tuck is splendid to watch.  So far I like what I've seen of our rookie CB Aaron Ross too.  The offense is looking pretty formidable as well.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets... oy... what can I say?  Chad is getting all the blame, but truth be told, it's not all his fault.  In fact, I'd lay most of the Jet problems on the defense.  The run defense can't even stop backups from having 100 yard games, the pass rush is nonexistent, and the cornerbacks commit penalties at the worst possible times.  Whether Mangini stays with Chad or switches to Kellen Clemens, I expect we'll be drafting very high next spring.  Let's see, any superstar defensive players coming out of college?\r\n\r\nAnd on other fronts, for all of you who hate American football...\r\n\r\nThe first volume of DREAMSONGS should be in U.S. bookstores by now, in hardcover.  Volume two will follow in a month.  Yes, this is the same collection originally published by Subterranean in 2003 as GRRM: A RRETROSPECTIVE.  Same contents, but if you missed that one, here's the chance to make up for that oversight.  The new edition has some nice interior artwork by Mike Kaluta as well.\r\n\r\nThe American edition of HUNTER'S RUN and the first volume of the new Wild Cards triad, INSIDE STRAIGHT, are both due for release in January.  Amazing covers on both, I think.  Stephen Martiniere did the HUNTER'S RUN cover, Michael Komarck INSIDE STRAIGHT.  Oh, and if you're a fan of fantasy art, check out the news page on my website to a glimpse of the artwork on the new Italian edition of THE ICE DRAGON.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gardner Dozois (my friend and co-editor) and I have gotten the first stories in on the two big original anthologies we're editing -- WARRIORS and SONGS OF THE DYING EARTH (the Jack Vance tribute anthology).  The books won't be out until 2009, of course, but Gardner and I are excited about them both, and it would seem our writers are as well.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I am trying to finish up the third Dunk & Egg story as my own contribution to WARRIORS.  Right now I'm calling it \"The Mystery Knight.\"  That's the fourth or fifth title I've slapped on this one.  We'll see if it sticks.\r\n\r\nDANCE WITH DRAGONS?  Yes, working on that too.  Lately it's been Tyrion and more Tyrion.  When I finish these three chapters, I will need to double back and pick up some of the other POVs lest my devious dwarf get too far ahead.\r\n\r\nAn email asked why I disabled comments on my last Not-A-Blog post, about the Dark Sword Miniatures.  My intent was not to discourage comments, but to redirect them to more appropriate places.  Dark Sword has its own message board.  So does Tom Meier, on his Thunderbolt Mountain website.  Jim and Tom have much more \"hands on\" (literally) involvement with the figures than I do, and I know both of them would be pleased to hear your thoughts and field your questions.  So take your comments to those forums, please.  I provided the appropriate links in my last post.","ditemid":22998,"eventtime":"2007-10-22 16:14:00","props":{"commentalter":1389029491,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-10-22 22:43:38","anum":214,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html","event_timestamp":1193069640,"reply_count":143,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/64575264/3779057","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?replyto=2694614","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694614#t2694614","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694614#t2694614","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694614#t2694614","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"arkadyevna","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://arkadyevna.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2694614,"talkid":10525,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694614#t2694614","article":"Yay for Tyrion and more Tyrion!  :D","upictitle":"Arkadyevna: Vasilisa","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"9 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"October 22 2007, 22:47:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://arkadyevna.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"arkadyevna","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"arkadyevna","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://arkadyevna.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"arkadyevna","ctime_ts":1193093273,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/22558796/925029","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?replyto=2694870","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694870#t2694870","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694870#t2694870","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694870#t2694870","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bakeme","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bakeme.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2694870,"talkid":10526,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2694870#t2694870","upictitle":"Tautological Profundity: pic#22558796","article":"tyrion is awesome.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"October 22 2007, 22:48:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bakeme.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bakeme","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bakeme","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bakeme.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bakeme","ctime_ts":1193093306,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?replyto=2695126","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2695126#t2695126","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2695126#t2695126","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2695126#t2695126","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hahnzie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hahnzie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2695126,"talkid":10527,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2695126#t2695126","upictitle":"hahnzie: pic#0","article":"Just rereading the first Ice and Fire books and I acn't get over how god they are.
