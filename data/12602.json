If you get a chance, don't just talk to George, stop by the Dabel booth and say hello to Les and Ernst Dabel, they are remarkable young men who are doing great things with their company. Heck, with their Laurel Hamilton series, they've lured women in comic book stores! We're going to be proud to say 'we knew them when' in a few years. All these publishers should have a listing in the program book or up at their booth on when various writers and artists will be appearing at that booth. <br /><br />Again, thanks for all the kind comments and thoughtfulness offered to us.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"February 23 2007, 15:32:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"parris here","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1172244749,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/12602.html?replyto=1637434","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/12602.html?thread=1637434#t1637434","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/12602.html?thread=1637434#t1637434","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/12602.html?thread=1637434#t1637434","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1637434,"talkid":6396,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/12602.html?thread=1637434#t1637434","above":1635642,"article":"Wow!
