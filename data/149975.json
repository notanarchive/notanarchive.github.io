{"itemid":585,"subject":"2010 NFL Draft","event":"Feels very strange to have the NFL draft opening in midweek, and in prime time, but there it is.  Round One is almost upon us, and the Rams are on the clock.  \r\n\r\n((And speaking of the Rams, they should take Suh, not Bradford.  Defense first.  Spags knows that.  I wonder if all this QB talk is just a smokescreen?  We'll find out soon))\r\n\r\nVery odd year for both my teams.  I have no idea who the Jets or Giants will select.  The Giants have pick #15 in the first round, and those mid-round picks are always hard to project.  No way of telling who will still be on the board.  Most mock drafts have the Giants going after a linebacker, ideally Roland McClain of Alabama, the consensus #1 LB.  The G-Men certainly need a game-changing impact LB, and if McClain falls to them, I think they need to take him... but about half the mocks suggest that he will be gone by the time they pick, most likely to Denver at #11.  If it falls out that way, I think it would be a mistake for the Giants to pick the second-best LB at #15.  No other player at the position is worth that high a pick.  If they must have a LB, and McClain is gone, they should trade down to the end of the round and pick up an extra pick or two.\r\n\r\nSome recent reports have the Giants targeting the draft's top running back, C.J. Spiller of Clemson.  Spiller would certainly make an exciting addition to the offense... but I don't think there's much chance he will fall to 15, which means in all likelihood the G-Men would need to trade up to get him.  Is he worth the price?  I don't know.  Yes, it's true, the Giants run game fell apart last season... but Brandon Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw were both playing with injuries that required post-season surgery, and rookie RB Andre Brown spent the whole year on injured reserve.  If all three come back healthy, the Giants should have plenty of talent and depth at the RB position, so I'm not sure we need Spiller.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets... things look even more confusing for Gang Green, who don't pick until #29.  Up until last month, most of the mock drafts had the Jets taking Notre Dame WR Golden Tate at that position, to give their passing attack a little punch.  But then Mike Tannenbaum traded a fifth-round choice to the Steelers for Santonio Holmes and his four-game suspension.  Once Holmes gets on the field besides Jericho Cotchery and Braylon \"Oops\" Edwards, the Jets should be set at wideout, so Tate no longer looks so likely.  \r\n\r\nAfter the trade, most draft gurus fighured the Jets would go after a pass-rushing DE or LB sack artist.  Despite the league's $1 defense last season, they did not get many sacks.  A real force off the edge could only make the D even better.  Vernon Gholston, alas, has proved to be a bust.  So another pass rusher seemed called for.  Only then the Jets signed Jason Taylor away from the Dolphins (Jason Taylor!  in Jets green!!  the end is nigh!!!).  Taylor should give them the disruption Rex wants on passing downs.  So maybe they don't need a sack artist now.  \r\n\r\nWhich leaves them... where?  I have no idea.\r\n\r\nI think it may come down to \"Best Player Available\" for both my teams.\r\n\r\nCan't wait for tomorrow!","ditemid":149975,"eventtime":"2010-04-21 13:22:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1272148032,"picture_keyword":"jets 2","personifi_word_count":599,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:13,18:5,35:5,11:13,37:11,42:3,16:13,3:9,25:9,19:5,26:3,20:7,9:18,22:7,13:16","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-04-21 19:22:32","anum":215,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html","event_timestamp":1271856120,"reply_count":51,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/45733751/4471038","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?replyto=9752791","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9752791#t9752791","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9752791#t9752791","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9752791#t9752791","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jeffxandra","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jeffxandra.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9752791,"talkid":38096,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9752791#t9752791","upictitle":"jeffxandra: Playing","article":"Us Ravens fans look forward to opening up the season with a win at Rex Ryan's new Home for Wayward Wide Receivers!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 21 2010, 19:25:24 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jeffxandra.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jeffxandra","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jeffxandra","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jeffxandra.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jeffxandra","ctime_ts":1271877924,"tracked":0},{"shown":0,"collapsed":1,"uname":"metamorphage","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9753047,"talkid":38097,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9753047#t9753047","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"metamorphage","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"metamorphage","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://metamorphage.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"metamorphage","ctime_ts":1271878075,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91258491/21255852","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?replyto=9753559","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9753559#t9753559","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9753559#t9753559","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9753559#t9753559","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9753559#t9753559","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vinnywest","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vinnywest.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9753559,"talkid":38099,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9753559#t9753559","above":9753047,"upictitle":"Vinny: Lazysquid","article":"Spiller is overrated because he's the only real pro prospect RB this year.

be terrible at the QB position. Bulger was never a *bad* QB, necessarily, but the fact that he's been ravaged by injury has made him mostly ineffective. If there's anything the past few years have shown, it is that teams cannot win without a star or star-in-the-making QB. I'd rather take a shot at a QB...because if he falls on his face, the Rams have a chance to draft another elite DB with a top-5 pick next year. The question, in my mind, is which QB to choose. Bradford seems to be the <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a> on the board in most people's minds. I don't quite understand this. He's coming off of injury, and played in blowouts (70%+ of his wins were by 10+ points) in college. Whenever he was really tested, he lost. McCoy and Clausen come from pro-style offenses and are much better equipped at this point to be effective starters right off the bat in the NFL.

I think it would be crazy on their part to get rid of him. I am not condoning his actions, a star of his caliper and fame needs to know that he is not just some Joe Frat Boy that can hook up with random girls when they first meet them. He was not charged with a crime and I feel that the suspension was excessive. I'm very sure that it will get dropped down to the 4 game minimum that was talked about for Ben's good behavior. The Steelers Front Office made their statement about off the field antics when they traded Holmes. If they really want to clean up the image of an honorable team they need to get rid of all the trouble makers, Harrison, Reed, and Batch as well. The organization is just trying to please the drunken uneducated football masses in Pittsburgh who are notorious for hating their QB's. Bradshaw refused to come back to Pittsburgh for a decade because of the treatment he got here. Last that I had heard here was that Oakland and Pittsburgh were in heated discussions on the topic.<br /><br />Ok rant over. Congrats on the Jets signing Jason Taylor, that really has me worried about the playoffs now. I think that the Giants could get what they need in a RB out of Toby Gerhart. He is projected to be a 2nd rounder with implications that he could be a <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a> RB in this years draft if he was not white. Interesting water cooler point but not really an issue in my mind. A guy has it or he doesn't. Doesn't matter where he is drafted.

But that type of \"improvement\" is not what you as fans should want - not only will you have back-to-back losing seasons, but you will also win too many games to pick up a franchise quarterback for the next few years. If the Rams pick up Suh, they will turn from a 1-15 team to a 5-11 team, which is great - but the Texans are a classic example of why a team with a great defense but a subpar offense doesn't win Super Bowls. They are starting to turn this around, but the rule stands. THE RAMS NEED JIMMY CLAUSEN. If they don't get him, they will have another losing season, even if Bradford turns out a hit and not a bust. With Jimmy Clausen, they turn from a team with a horrible offense to a team with a franchise QB, franchise LT, and franchise RB - which is all you need in this day and age to make the playoffs.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 22 2010, 22:51:42 UTC","parent":9760471,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: please take bradford, rams","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nukerxform.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nukerxform","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nukerxform","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nukerxform.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nukerxform","ctime_ts":1271976702,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/33710120/7554951","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?replyto=9761239","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9761239#t9761239","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9761239#t9761239","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9761239#t9761239","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"metzhead","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://metzhead.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9761239,"talkid":38129,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9761239#t9761239","upictitle":"metzhead: canyonman","article":"Giants need someone for Eli to throw to.

If an elite defensive end is left by the time they pick, they should grab one to add youth and talent to their defensive front. Free Safety has not been addressed, and I'm not convinced Cromartie is the answer at cornerback. This Jets team looks like the 2008 edition of the Giants going into 2009 - Plenty of talent, unexpected bonuses on defense, but if their secondary isn't addressed, they will have a season like the Giants did in 2009.

Spags wanted to go D, I'm pretty sure, and so did I, but...<br /><br />We got the girl. Guess we have to kiss 'er.<br /><br />To GRRM's Jets... quality! Some people will criticize the Jets taking yet another DB, but in this case... holy hell, Wilson is a stud. I watched Boise State three times this year, and Wilson owned. He was everywhere. This guy is just stud athlete, period. Can you imagine the disruptions the Jets can cause with a whirlwind of top-rate DB's at their command? It's not a 2-DB league any more. I can hear Rexie giggling all the way over here in L.A. <br /> <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 23 2010, 10:55:30 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://axechucker.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"axechucker","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"axechucker","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://axechucker.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"axechucker","ctime_ts":1272020130,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98373681/25552653","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?replyto=9766871","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9766871#t9766871","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9766871#t9766871","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9766871#t9766871","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mfanderson","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mfanderson.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9766871,"talkid":38151,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/149975.html?thread=9766871#t9766871","upictitle":"mfanderson: pic#98373681","article":"Just started reading A Game of Thorns.
