{"itemid":2021,"subject":"Then There Were Two","event":"Another week, another round of NFL playoffs.\r\n\r\nLast week in the divisional round, we got two great games and two blowouts.  I was hoping that this week's conference championships would give us more exciting contests, but no such luck.  The Falcons ripped right through Green Bay and the Patriots obliterated the Steelers.  Neither contest was even remotely competitive.  \r\n\r\nNot much to say about either game, really.  Aaron Rodgers is amazing, yes, but he doesn't play defense, and the Packer D could not even seem to slow down Matty Ice, let alone stop him.  And the Patriots... yeah, yeah, Brady is good, especially when you give him weeks to sit in the pocket unmolested and don't cover his receivers.  I watched him complete pass after pass that seemed to be totally uncontested, with the receiver standing all alone and not a defender within yards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we have our SuperBowl: Patriots against Falcons.\r\n\r\nNothing much to say but GO FALCONS.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I am thinking about next year's draft...","ditemid":517567,"eventtime":"2017-01-23 11:22:00","props":{"current_mood":"bored","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jan 23 18:22:47 2017]R [Mon Jan 23 18:22:49 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/823596864255692800 ","current_moodid":5,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1488733280,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/823596864255692800","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.607057791832386]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1485195797}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2021?v=1485639296","revtime":1485639292},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-23 18:22:44","anum":191,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html","event_timestamp":1485170520,"reply_count":54,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/127020906/80655850","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25651391#t25651391","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25651391#t25651391","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25651391#t25651391","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25651391#t25651391","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3985791","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Elgrandegato35","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25651391,"talkid":100200,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25651391#t25651391","article":"Not a Pats fan there George?","upictitle":"Zack: pic#127020906","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"3 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"January 23 2017, 18:24:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Elgrandegato35","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Elgrandegato35","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3985791","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=80655850&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Elgrandegato35","ctime_ts":1485195885,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121699860/66021282","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25658303#t25658303","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25658303#t25658303","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25658303#t25658303","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2128407","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/torome86","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25658303,"talkid":100227,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/517567.html?thread=25658303#t25658303","above":25651391,"upictitle":"Jimmy Potter: pic#121699860","article":"Seriously, he hates the Patriots so much that it borders on irrational.
