{"itemid":279,"subject":"Last Chance for FEVRE DREAM","event":"The gorgeous Subterranean Press limited edition of my historical horror novel FEVRE DREAM was sold out many months ago, or so we thought... but Bill Schafer has just turned up another box of numbered copies, so the book is once again (briefly) available, so long as that supply lasts.  It probably won't be long.\r\n\r\nThis is a really stunning edition, with some magnificent artwork by Justin Sweet.  If you'd like to snag one of these last few copies, order from the SubPress webpage at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.subterraneanpress.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=SP&Product_Code=martin2\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000055xg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000055xg/s320x240\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of FEVRE DREAM, my own stock of the first edition Poseidon Press hardcover from 1982, which I've been offering autographed on my Signed Books page for, like, forever, is also running low.  At this writing fewer than twenty copies remain, so if you want one of them, this is the time to act on that as well.  \r\n\r\nAt $29, these are considerably cheaper than the $125 Subterranean edition, and they are firsts... but what few copies remain, alas, are remainder stamped, and the dustjackets of this last batch are pretty beat up, with various scuffings, tears, scrapes, chips, and the like.  Copies are offered as is, so long as they last.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002gr2d/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002gr2d\" width=\"103\" height=\"150\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nWhether Subterranean or Poseidon, if you want to voyage down into the heart of darkness on the fleet packet steamer Fevre Dream with Abner and Joshua, this is the time to board.","ditemid":71561,"eventtime":"2009-02-16 14:16:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":248,"taglist":"subterranean","opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1234934676,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-02-16 21:32:56","anum":137,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/71561.html","event_timestamp":1234793760,"reply_count":20,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/63130027/936760","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/71561.html?replyto=5299849","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/71561.html?thread=5299849#t5299849","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/71561.html?thread=5299849#t5299849","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/71561.html?thread=5299849#t5299849","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"anvilchorus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://anvilchorus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5299849,"talkid":20702,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/71561.html?thread=5299849#t5299849","article":"I initally read the cover as \"Favre Dream\", and as a Bears fan, I am pretty sure he's a nightmare, not a dream.","upictitle":"T.
