I feel a certain duty to relate this, considering that it might never have been mentioned to you. I've taken a look at the Brazilian version of ASOIAF, and, considering the contact I've had with the original version, the impression I get is that it was written by Edgar Allan Poe or some other really old writer. Translation has created a distorted version of your story. My guess is there was no translation, just appropriation from the Portuguese version. And here I must make something clear: Brazilian Portuguese is something entirely different from Portuguese Portuguese. Since the books had already been published in Portugal, it seems the same translation has been used here in Brazil, maybe with only some minor changes. That has greatly disappointed me, for I can see the distance it stands from the original work. And I had great expectations for other readers to have the opportunity to read those books, with the same ease I had to read them in the original version. But it's gonna be really hard for them to do that. Maybe you already know this, maybe you don't. Like I said, I felt responsible for the warning. Not sure about what can be done, if anything at all is necessary. Good luck to you. I know you'll have it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"October 30 2010, 12:00:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Warning about the Brazilian version","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://theblanka.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"theblanka","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"theblanka","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://theblanka.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"theblanka","ctime_ts":1288440003,"tracked":0}]}
