I find it interesting that the Jets wanted to talk to Bill Cowher, who quickly said he wasn't interested.  If Cowher had been coaching for the Jets management and not the Steelers, he would have been fired long before he had his Superbowl teams.  Most good coaches will have bad years, and Cowher had several worse than the Jets' this year.  But the Pittsburgh management sticks with their coaches, unlike most of the NFL owners where it is win quick or else.  Another key to the Steelers' success over the years is that they don't go for the pricey free agent talent, unlike the Jets.  Remember Neil O'Donnell?  How many millions did the Jets pay to get him away from Pittsburgh?  How many seasons did he last after that?  When will they learn to develop young talent rather than go for the high priced free agents past their prime?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"January 3 2009, 20:14:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Jets coach firing","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gebanks.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gebanks","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gebanks","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gebanks.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"gebanks","ctime_ts":1231013666,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109915172/10560429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?replyto=4975993","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4975993#t4975993","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4975993#t4975993","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4975993#t4975993","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nycfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4975993,"talkid":19437,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4975993#t4975993","above":4968057,"upictitle":"nycfalcon: pic#109915172","article":"I wonder what the difference is in how much the Steelers invest in scouting and player development compared to teams like the Jets, Lions, Chiefs, etc. We saw that this season the Jets were absolutely clueless on how to develop their top draft pick Vernon Gholston.

I could be wrong. <br /><br />Well Chad is who we thought he is. A weak armed pocket passer. It wasn't so much that he played poorly, but more so the Ravens made him play poorly. And, neither he nor the Dolphins had the tools to overcome that type of pressure. He's a smart guy who I think could be very good in coaching. I expect he'll probably have a backup position next season and likely not with the Dolphins.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"January 5 2009, 21:48:45 UTC","parent":4971641,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1231192125,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/90547506/12553023","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?replyto=4971897","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4971897#t4971897","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4971897#t4971897","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4971897#t4971897","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4971897#t4971897","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bbeitel","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bbeitel.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4971897,"talkid":19421,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/65657.html?thread=4971897#t4971897","upictitle":"bbeitel: pic#90547506","article":"This whole weekend has been odd, considering all things football.

I guess the Utah Utes were for real after all, after dispatching Alabama. If UF beats OU, I think Utah should jump to <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%231\">#1</a> (or at least a share).  Wasn't it Alabama that beat Florida early in the season?
