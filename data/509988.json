There were SO many times prior to me doing so, where I'd have a great idea, find a great phrase I'd like to use, and so forth, that I just wouldn't remember completely or correctly once I got back home to my office.  Now, whenever I have some flash of brilliance away from my desk, regardless of where I am, I can record it either manually, or digitally via my device I'm using.  I usually use the voice message feature for this in terms of simplicity and speed, and then transcribe the message to a sticky note  or my primary note/work book once I'm back to the comforts of home.<br /><br />IIRC George said he used a combination of methods, I did ask if he used a \"wall\" or \"easel\", and that was his response.  Again, I'll find the quote if George doesn't reply himself.<br /><br />Alex, what do you prefer to use yourself?  It's always interesting, and often instructive for me, to understand the process that other writers use, many of whom are new writers like us.  Myself, I use a combination as well, as I said I use a small notebook/device when away from home, but I do immediately transfer any notes from these to my primary note/work book I'm using on a particular project.  I also use an easel, where I can attach sticky notes and so forth, it's dry erase as well which I've found to work the best for me as I can just make notes and draw diagrams and flow charts which aren't permanent.<br /><br />Regarding Wild Cards, I recently began reading this fantastic series as well, in addition to much of GRRM's other works.  I had found a Youtube channel by Preston Jacobs, and he analyses ASOIAF of course, but also much of George's other works.  1000 Worlds, and of course Wildcards, and his videos are the reason I began reading Wild Cards.  I've purchased ALL of them, and am working my way through them daily. Great news about the new Tor downloads coming, very generous, I can't wait to add another to the stack.<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't read \"Fevre Dream\", you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion one of Martin's best stories.  In a time where vampire books and films are a dime a dozen, and seem to getting progressively more...annoying, Fevre Dream delivers what is the best work in print regarding vampires.  Also, being an insatiable fan of Mark Twain, the setting on river boats is incredibly vivid, filled with great descriptions and details about both the river and the boats.  I highly recommend reading it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 months ago","ctime":"December 9 2016, 07:22:12 UTC","parent":25378852,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: How do you keep track of your notes?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gman109","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gman109","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gman109.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"December 9 2016, 07:24:58 UTC","dname":"gman109","ctime_ts":1481268132,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126584417/78646200","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509988.html?thread=25379364#t25379364","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509988.html?thread=25379364#t25379364","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509988.html?thread=25379364#t25379364","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"striker163","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://striker163.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25379364,"talkid":99138,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/509988.html?thread=25379364#t25379364","upictitle":"striker163: pic#126584417","article":"Hey George, sorry that this is out of place, and if you don't want to answer it I completely understand, but I was hoping I could hear your opinion on the film, Prometheus. The reason I ask you this is because the film asked a lot of deep questions and had some very creative premises, but also stumbled in some plot related aspects. As an aspiring storyteller and someone who wants to create pieces sort of similar in this approach I am really curious how you view this dilemma of asking these incredibly deep questions, but maintaining a solid plot that doesn't waver to much, or if you even believe there were truly problems. Personally I overall loved the film, I thought it brought a lot to the franchise and opened up a lot of interesting routs for the series to go, but I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge what I consider some issues with the overall plot. I really just want to know your opinion, primarily from an educational standpoint. Thanks for reading.

I know Marvel comics had a big impact on you as well. I was beyond excited the first time you talked about Stan Lee and Marvel about how they inspired you.<br /><br />The reason why? Every English teacher I ever had turned their nose up at the idea comics were literature and laughed at my notion at how well crafted the characters in Marvel were. Of course, they were all too good to read them as well.  <br /><br />This was back in the 1980's and 1990's. I guess until Marvel got popular in the movies that attitude still thrived in my experiences. I was supposed to be reading Moby Dick, Catcher and the Rye and Shakespear 24/7. Quite honestly they looked at me like I was crazy when I called comics an influence. They had their mind made up, \"successful\", or \"real authors\" do not have such influences. <br /><br />Fantasy was not held much higher in that regard. Science fiction as never talked about at all. The reading material in school was never Kipling (Rikki Tikki Tavi is my favorite Novella of all time), Tolkien, or Richard Adams. Watership Down is amazing, forgive me George but when I meet people who have no idea about Watership Down, not to cast shade at Adams but I tell them, \"Imagine if GRRM wrote a Pixar movie.\"<br /><br />Hopefully, in schools, the attitude has changed and in literature circles regarding Fantasy and Comics. Hate when teachers crap on young Author's influences. I use you as an example of how ignorant they were. Other Author's too obviously.<br /><br />I would love to invent a time machine go back and give them one of your books and tell them to suck eggs.
