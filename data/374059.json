I had always known Venus as the hell we know it to be today... deadly in heat, pressure, acidity... the hell that they now call in Star Trek a \"Demon Class\" planet. Truth be told I can't imagine how anyone could call that boring. Especially now that we theorize that before it's runaway Greenhouse effect turned it into a hell it may have had abundant water and maybe even early (single celled) life... it is after all in the goldilocks zone, along with both Earth and Mars. Personally, I think a modern Venus time travel story could be amazing... heck one could even run with the \"there may have been life\" thing and take that somewhere further. A story featuring jumping between a verdant past and its current nightmarish form, perhaps trying to avert the planetwide disaster that made it what it is today. Maybe a story about alien colonists settling in or experimenting with the world, lovecrafting cosmic horror style... or hell just go old trope and make the Venus of hundreds of millions of years ago \"Old Venus\" swampy and balmy, it could work. <br /><br />Another thought, and something modern scientists consider is that perhaps there may be remnants of Venus' earlier life still living high in the clouds above the heat, pressure, and acid. While they figure it unicellular one could conceive of terrifying flying or floating beasts, perhaps malevolently intelligent, even creepier if they still had some sort of inherited memory of their home's original form. Perhaps as part of the above time travel story. Or even a similar story told in flashback from a mind meld or mind scan of a captured creature by future scientists in a lab floating above the clouds.<br /><br />That said, future tales about a terraformed Venus are great as well, and plausible. After all it IS in the Gzone and it does have Earth gravity. Indeed, my primary experience of Venus in scifi is Ray Bradbury's short story about a rainy terraformed Venus and children marveling over the sight of the rarely seen sun. I suppose I like to keep my scifi as \"hard\" as possible... but perhaps it would be nice to see how people thought of it before we knew... it just seems like the possibilities based on the reality could be wilder and more fascinating than what we used to imagine.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"June 5 2014, 05:52:16 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Thoughts on Venus","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gehrig.jon","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gehrig JonLou","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2565121","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70603342&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"June 5 2014, 05:56:19 UTC","dname":"Gehrig JonLou","ctime_ts":1401947536,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/32991294/7506823","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/374059.html?thread=19205419#t19205419","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/374059.html?thread=19205419#t19205419","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/374059.html?thread=19205419#t19205419","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kostinus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kostinus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19205419,"talkid":75021,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/374059.html?thread=19205419#t19205419","upictitle":"kostinus: kostinus","article":"Will it be available as e-book on Amazon?
