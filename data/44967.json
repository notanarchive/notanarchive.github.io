{"itemid":175,"subject":"Getcha DYING EARTH Books Now","event":"Our Jack Vance tribute anthology, SONGS OF THE DYING EARTH, is coming along wonderfully, with more stories arriving every day, so Subterranean Press has started taking pre-orders for their numbered and lettered limited editions of the book, illustrated by Tom Kidd.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000fr1b/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0000fr1b/s320x240\" width=\"181\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nHere's an advance peek at Tom's cover painting.  It's not quite done, but this will give you the flavor of it.  The scene depicts the ruins of the Museum of Man.  I've seen the rough sketches of some of Tom's interiors as well, and those should be great as well.\r\n\r\nBut there's no sense in me telling you all about the wonders of the book when Subterranean's website does that for me.  Go check it out at http://www.subterraneanpress.com/ and place your order soon.  Jack Vance has a lot of fans, and we expect these editions to go fast,","ditemid":44967,"eventtime":"2008-06-05 20:49:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":150,"current_moodid":41,"current_music":"Benson, Arizona","commentalter":1212838003,"verticals_list":"books,culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-06-06 02:57:07","anum":167,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/44967.html","event_timestamp":1212698940,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/59421116/9682409","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/44967.html?replyto=3921319","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/44967.html?thread=3921319#t3921319","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/44967.html?thread=3921319#t3921319","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/44967.html?thread=3921319#t3921319","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"werthead","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://werthead.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3921319,"talkid":15317,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/44967.html?thread=3921319#t3921319","upictitle":"werthead: SunsetPyrynees","article":"Damn.
