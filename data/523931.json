From where I sit, \"Getting rid of all of my favorite players\" would be more accurate.\r\n\r\nBrandon Marshall.  Darrell Revis.  Nick Mangold.  And there are rumors that Eric Decker may be next.\r\n\r\nThat's their best two receivers and their best lineman.  Yes, Nick was getting old, and he was injured last year.  Yes, Darrell was not the shutdown corner he was.  Yes, all of them were expensive, and old, or getting old.  \r\n\r\nStill... is there anyone on the roster to replace them?  Gang Green created tons of salary cap room with these moves, but does that help anyone but Woody Johnson?  Salary cap room is great if you use it to bring in blue chip free agents, but what free agent would want to come to the Jets now?\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea is to lose ALL the games next year, to get the number one draft pick.  I haven't even paid much attention to the 2017 draft yet, the 2018 draft is completely off my radar.   Is there some new John Elway/ Peyton Manning/ Andrew Luck calibre can't-miss quarterback prospect that the Jets are looking toward a year and a half out?  \r\n\r\nI fear I am in for a lot of painful Sundays next fall.","ditemid":523931,"eventtime":"2017-03-03 14:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"confused","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Mar  3 21:59:09 2017]R [Fri Mar  3 21:59:10 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/837784439157583873 ","current_moodid":6,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1488733808,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/837784439157583873","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.712142445450185]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1488578364}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2046?v=1488840591","revtime":1488840589},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-03-03 21:59:08","anum":155,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html","event_timestamp":1488553140,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126988489/80322149","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25798299#t25798299","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25798299#t25798299","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25798299#t25798299","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3966414","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/563172833808087/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25798299,"talkid":100774,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25798299#t25798299","upictitle":"Keith Barry: pic#126988489","article":"Throwing the baby out with the bath water.

The best prospect is Sam Darnold out of USC. A lot of the scouts are comparing him to Andrew Luck. He has the size (6'4\" 225 lbs) and led USC on a 9 game win streak after starting as the backup last year. I recommend you watch his highlights from the Rose Bowl against Penn State to see a gutsy and franchise-QB worthy performance. Book it now that the saying among us Jets fans next year will be \"Suck for Sam\". Only thing that can get in our way is if he doesn't leave school (he's only a Redshirt Sophomore).<br /><br />The other highly regarded prospect is Josh Rosen at UCLA. He was the top recruit coming out of high school and won the job as a freshman where he performed quite well before having some regression in his sophomore season due to injuries and inaccuracy. He has the size, arm, and personality to handle being a QB in NY but needs to turn it back around this year or people will lump him into the Hackenberg category.<br /><br />Overall, as Jets fans we knew this rebuild would be necessary with our core talented players moving out of their primes. Time to be patient, dig in and hope that we find the QB who can turn it around and put an end to our title drought!<br /><br />-Alex<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 months ago","below":25803419,"ctime":"March 3 2017, 23:43:16 UTC","parent":25801115,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/118430673915581437639","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Alexander Tishler","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_4040436","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=81355897&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Alexander Tishler","ctime_ts":1488584596,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25803419#t25803419","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25803419#t25803419","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25803419#t25803419","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_4040485","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/108140471632373486418","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25803419,"talkid":100794,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/523931.html?thread=25803419#t25803419","above":25802395,"upictitle":"Caleb Vandertulip: pic#0","article":"Josh Rosen from UCLA and USC Sam Darnold are supposedly great prospects.
