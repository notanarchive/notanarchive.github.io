Pretty chilling if you ask me. However, it isn't very surprising, sad to say. You go from declaring war on \"terror\" -- or in other words groups of people -- to saying you'll strip citizenship from people who allegedly or actually support these groups of people. Well, it's nice and arbitrary, and the full weight of the government will make sure that defending yourself successfully is almost impossible.<br /><br />It used to be that we declared war against actual nation-states. You know, like we did with Japan and Germany. Now we're reduced to doing it against a bunch of whackjobs living in the desert half a world away with no real military to speak of. It's pretty pathetic on our part, IMO... and dangerous, too.<br /><br />As far as Liberman himself: I'm not the least bit surprised. The man, like many politicians, has been for sale all along. The deeper and long term ramifications of this bill doesn't matter to him at all.

As far as I'm concerned, he should not be a Senator any longer, but the people of Connecticut don't share my views. At least he's not as much of a nut job as Kerry was. He scared the shit out of me. <br /><br />Have you read what he's proposing in this act? This is not something new...we've been doing this since WW2, when anyone who went to fight for Japan or Germany was expatriated. This law was upheld as constitutional in 1980, when it was challenged. <br /><br />I have no problem with this, as long as due process is observed, which by the existing law it must be. Even after the State Department strips someone of their citizenship, they can still appeal to Federal Court of Appeals. This is not some arbitrary \"you pissed us off so we're kicking you out\" law. <br /><br />If someone attacks this country, or knowingly associates themselves with a terrorist organization who intends or expresses desire to attack this country and kill American citizens, why would we want them to remain citizens? So they can come & go as they please? NO! Strip them of their citizenship, revoke their passport and leave them wherever they decided to go and be with their terrorist friends! <br /><br />Have you not been paying attention to the recent attempted attacks? They've ALL been US Citizens! All of them have gone overseas, spent time with known terrorist groups and then returned to the US, on their US passports, and attempted to KILL US Citizens! WHY wouldn't we expatriate them?!? Next you're going to tell me we shouldn't jail and execute murders. <br /><br />Can any one of you give me one good reason as to why we shouldn't kick these people out? <br /><br />Here's Lieberman's speech regarding this bill: <a href='http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/news-events/news/2010/5/lieberman-statement-on-introduction-of-terrorist-expatriation-act' rel='nofollow'>http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/n<wbr />ews-events/news/2010/5/lieberman-stateme<wbr />nt-on-introduction-of-terrorist-expatria<wbr />tion-act</a><br /><br />Pay close attention to the part about your lord & savior, Obama, signing off on an assassination order!
