{"itemid":1917,"subject":"Signed Books - International Edition","event":"Ever since the Jean Cocteau Cinema began offering autographed books from our author events for sale via mailorder, we have been getting queries from readers in Europe, South America, Asia, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand about placing orders.  We haven't been able to fulfill those requests, alas.  Up till now, books were only available within the US.\r\n\r\nThe problem is shipping.  There is, unfortunately, no simple, easy, and inexpensive way to ship books (or anything else, alas) outside the US.  Not any more.  Once upon a time, a shipper could choose between air mail (fast but expensive) and sea mail (slow but cheap).  Then sea mail got abolished.  After that, for a time, there was a thing called an M-bag (slow but cheap).  That got abolished too.  Within the US, there is Media Mail, formerly known as Book Rate, which saves a lot of money... but Media Mail does not work beyond the borders of the US.  Internationally, there is only air mail... oh, and the various express services, like DHL and FedEx.  So effectively the shipping options for our friends overseas are limited to Expensive and Very Expensive and Very Very <i><b>Very</b></i> Expensive (for overnight).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/361936/361936_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/362019/362019_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/362485/362485_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nI've had my JCC staff working on this problem for many months, trying to find a solution.  Sadly, there does not seem to be one.  Yet even so, the queries still come in.  So we've decided to bite the bullet -- for a short time, at least, as an experiment -- and offer the signed books from the JCC bookstore for sale to everyone around the world.  We'll see how much demand there is, and how much time order fulfillment requires from my already overworked staff.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/362560/362560_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/362924/362924_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/363225/363225_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nBut please take note.   The process is complicated and onerous, and shipping costs will be high.  In many cases, depending on what you're ordering, shipping will be more than the actual cost of the books themselves.  ALSO, please note, there could be additional charges on your end.  We have no control over taxes, tariffs, customs costs, and import duties.  Every nation has its own rules.  Once the shipment leaves the Jean Cocteau, it's out of our hand... so if your customs people stop the package and ask for fees, there's nothing we can do about it.\r\n\r\n((All these problems are among the reasons why we have not been taking international orders up until now.  Too many complications, too many complaints)).\r\n\r\nSo... if I haven't discouraged all of you sufficiently, here's the complex and expensive procedure for placing orders from outside the USA:\r\n\r\n1. Guest selects item(s) from the JCC website.  http://www.jeancocteaubooks.com/\r\n\r\n2. Guest has to email: jeancocteausantafe@gmail.com. The email should contain the following: item(s), and destination.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/363362/363362_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/363639/363639_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/364021/364021_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n3. JCC will review the order and weigh the item(s)\r\n\r\n4. JCC will enter destination, weight, value, dimensions of shipping box on USPS website to get the shipping cost.  Unless instructed to use FedEx of DHL or other more expensive method, we will always look for the cheapest method. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/364185/364185_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/364332/364332_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/364740/364740_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n5. JCC will email the guest with the total cost of the order (books, shipping, handling).\r\n\r\n6. If the guest agrees, JCC will invoice him/ her via PayPal.   <i><b>PayPal is the ONLY payment method we can accept for international orders, sorry.</b></i>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/364945/364945_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/365069/365069_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/365543/365543_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n7.  Guest pays invoice.\r\n\r\n8.  Books are shipped.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/365798/365798_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/365987/365987_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/366175/366175_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nAll of the books pictured above are available, along with many more.  Visit the Jean Cocteau website for the full list.  Stocks are limited, however.   We do sell out.\r\n\r\n<b>ALL </b> the books sold by the JCC are signed by the author and/or editor.  Some of the anthologies and Wild Cards books have multiple autographs, though we cannot guarantee that.  However, we cannot offer personalizations or inscriptions.  Just signatures.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we are only offering English-language editions... but if this system does not prove too costly for the readers, or too burdersome for my staff, we may be able to offer limited amounts of foreign language editions and translations in the future.  Watch this blog for announcements to that effect from my minions.  (And if you are looking for one of my books in a specific language, feel free to write the JCC at the email above and request it.  We may have some).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/366421/366421_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img

would like to do our best to serve them.\r\n\r\nHappy reading.","ditemid":490872,"eventtime":"2016-06-18 16:03:00","props":{"current_mood":"frustrated","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean

If you have customers living in the Philippines, they may want to try \"LBC Shipping Cart\". It's a forwarding service that provides customers with a US address-- the LBC warehouse-- that they can use for online shopping in the US. Their packages are shipped to the LBC warehouse, then LBC takes care of getting the packages to the Philippines (through customs and all) and straight to the customer's doorstep. They offer both air and sea shipping options. It's pretty neat! I've already had several packages shipped from the US, to me in Manila, this way. LBC is one of the leading couriers here in the Philippines, so they are quite reliable. There are other similar services here in the Philippines but so far I've only tried LBC.<br /><br />Perhaps other countries have similar services too.<br /><br />(I'm not associated with LBC in any way, nor am I paid to endorse them, I'm just a happy customer.)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 months ago","ctime":"June 19 2016, 11:15:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Mail forwarder for customers in the Philippines","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://venusandbast.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"venusandbast","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"venusandbast","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://venusandbast.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"venusandbast","ctime_ts":"1466334900","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125395140/76784638","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/490872.html?replyto=24668024","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/490872.html?thread=24668024#t24668024","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/490872.html?thread=24668024#t24668024","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/490872.html?thread=24668024#t24668024","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jacobsb2440","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jacobsb2440.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24668024,"talkid":96359,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/490872.html?thread=24668024#t24668024","upictitle":"jacobsb2440: pic#125395140","article":"When you're frustrated just take a power nap and have a pleasant \"Dream of Spring.\"  If the nap goes well and you're up to it, you could  jot down a simple 1500+page manuscript about it.

Thanks for your hard work and I adore your novels. I've reread ASOIAF four times over now, still doesn't get old for me. But seriously, take a load off my friend. Enjoy yourself and drink a beer, attend feasts and have fun. I'm along for the ride here, and your story is one heck of a ride. The speculation and fun debates with my fellow fans are part of the ride, so by all means don't try to get Winds out this year just due to any pressure. We'll still be around 10 years from now to enjoy the book if that's how long it takes. Some people just like to complain, but they don't really know what they're talking about.<br />   Like you need to hear that from a little guy like me, heh. Peace and love, your Grace.
