Amy-Joyce Hastings and writer-director Graham Cantwell are flying in from Ireland for the event, and will introduce the film and answer questions afterwards, and we&#39;ll also be having a small post-screening reception at the Cocteau&#39;s new bar, where you can meet Graham and Amy-Joyce and sample a &quot;Call Me For Comfort,&quot; our special CALLBACK QUEEN cocktail.\r\n\r\nSo see you there.&nbsp; But don&#39;t ask me to sign your copy of PRINCE OF CHAOS.&nbsp; I am not Horatio King.&nbsp; (They never even asked me to audition for the role).</p>((THE CALLBACK QUEEN will be playing for four days only, February 7 - 11.))\r\n\r\nP.S.&nbsp; And yes, your eyes are not deceiving you, the role of the director in THE CALLBACK QUEEN is being played by Mero, the Titan&#39;s Bastard.&nbsp; Someone must have sewed his head back on after Daario hacked it off.&nbsp;
