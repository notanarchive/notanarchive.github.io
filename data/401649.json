{"itemid":1568,"subject":"Win Some, Lose Some","event":"Well, at least the Cowboys lost.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the results of this weekend&#39;s various contests were pretty depressing, from where I stand.\r\n\r\nSeahawks beat the Panthers pretty soundly, as most people expected.&nbsp; No big surprise there.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes at the start, and a few minutes in the middle, the Ravens were two touchdowns up on the Patriots, and it looked as though Evil Little Bill might go down as well.&nbsp; But New England and Tom Brady rallied, not once but twice... once, admittedly, aided by what the Ravens coach called a &#39;substitution trick,&#39; which wasn&#39;t illegal but probably should be.&nbsp; No one ever said Evil Little Bill wasn&#39;t clever.&nbsp; And in the end Joe Flacco threw a killer INT, and the Pats moved on.&nbsp; That made me mad and sad.\r\n\r\nBut not as sad as Jerry Jones and Chris Christie probably were when the Cowboys lost.&nbsp; Last week TV showed up the two of them high-fiving and hugging when Dallas won, it was a pity we didn&#39;t get a good shot of them this week when the &#39;Boys went down.&nbsp; (And honestly, the very idea of the governor of New Jersey rooting for the Cowboys instead of the Jets or the Giants or even the Eagles... never mind Bridgegate, Christie should be impeached for that alone).\r\n\r\nAndrew Luck and the Colts upset Peyton Manning and the Broncos.&nbsp; Peyton did not look at all like himself, and this morning all the talking heads are speculating that he might be near the end of the line.&nbsp; I hope that&#39;s not so... but if he does retire, well, it was sad to see him go out with such an underwhelming performance.&nbsp; What&#39;s doubly sad is that I don&#39;t think the Colts have a chance in hell of beating the Patriots next week at Foxboro, which means Brady and Belicheck will be heading to another Superbowl, pfui.\r\n\r\nAs for the Cowboys and the Packers... it was a lot closer than I thought it would be, and I have to give props to Jason Garrett, who did a helluva job of coaching and showed real guts at a couple of key spots, and Tony Romo, who played an amazing game and did not make the patented Tony Romo Mistake that all of us Cowboy haters were waiting for.&nbsp; But in the end, the game belonged to Aaron Rodgers, who gave the most heroic&nbsp; performance by a one-legged limping star that the world has seen since Hopalong Cassidy. \r\n\r\nAnd then there was the dagger through the heart: Dez Bryant and the catch that wasn&#39;t a catch.&nbsp; Sorry, Dallas, them&#39;s the rules.&nbsp; Ask Calvin Johnson.&nbsp; Oh, and that sound you hear -- that&#39;s the city of Detroit, laughing their asses off.&nbsp; Karma&#39;s a bitch.&nbsp; The refs giveth, and the refs taketh away.\r\n\r\nAs for the non-football contests, yes, of course, GAME OF THRONES lost another Golden Globe.&nbsp; This one to THE AFFAIR.&nbsp; Nothing unexpected there, and I am glad I saved myself some time and money and stayed home.&nbsp; Sad to say, I don&#39;t think any fantasy will ever win a Golden Globe.&nbsp; The prejudice against genre shows runs too deep.&nbsp; I did think Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were great, however, and I liked Allan Cummings in his peach suit-shirt-tie ensemble.\r\n\r\nBut never mind.&nbsp; The Cowboys lost, so I went to sleep with a smile on my face.","ditemid":401649,"eventtime":"2015-01-12 12:22:00","props":{"current_mood":"drained","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl, awards, game of thrones","current_moodid":40,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1438537572,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Win Some, Lose Some http://j.mp/1ycfMbQ","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.739497111574215]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1421090557}","revtime":1438537669},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-01-12 19:22:29","anum":241,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401649.html","event_timestamp":1421065320,"reply_count":47,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117011476/48712273","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401649.html?thread=20085233#t20085233","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401649.html?thread=20085233#t20085233","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401649.html?thread=20085233#t20085233","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1171099","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1371132871","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20085233,"talkid":78457,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/401649.html?thread=20085233#t20085233","article":"Me too.<br />Smiling as I drifted off thinking of the Cowboys going down in defeat.<br /><br />Yesterday should be called the Sunday of the Limping Quarterbacks cause Rodgers of course was hobbling and jumping on one leg all over the field, Romo got hurt and hobbled for a quite a while, and then it turns out Manning had an injury to his quads for the past month.  <br /><br />The one, to me, who played smartest with his injury was Rodgers.
