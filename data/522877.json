{"itemid":2042,"subject":"Hugo Thoughts: Best Novel","event":"The Big One.\r\n\r\nI read a lot of novels.  I became a voracious reader as a kid, and very little has changed since... well, no, one thing has changed.  I no longer feel an obsessive need to finish every book I start.  Some just don't hold my interest, and I find myself putting them aside and picking up something else.  Sometimes I return to the books I've put aside and sometimes I don't.  \r\n\r\nOne of life's greatest pleasures, for me, is finding a book that's so bloody damn good that it won't LET me put it aside.  The kind of book that grabs me by the throat and will not let me go.  Those sorts of books are not easy to find, but I treasure the authors who deliver them regularly.\r\n\r\nJack Vance had that effect on me, for decades.  Bernard Cornwell still does.  Stephen King too.  Once I start a book by any of these worthies, I am hooked.  I will keep reading till the end.\r\n\r\nRecently I have had to add James S.A. Corey to that list.   Which is annoying, because I know both halves of James S.A. Corey.  One of them was a student of mine.  The other was my proto-minion.  How the hell did they get so damned good?  \r\n\r\nHowever they did it, it's done.  Now, I am sure there were lots of great SF and fantasy novels published during 2016 that I have not read yet (I read lots of books, like I said, but not all are SF or fantasy, I read lots of history and mystery and historical fiction and biographies and non-fiction as well, and I read older books too, not just stuff from the current awards year, so I'm always trying to catch up).  Of all the SF novels from 2016 that I have read, however, this was the best:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/424409/424409_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nFor me, it wasn't even close.  I expect I will fill in all six slots on my Hugo nomination form with the titles of worthy contenders, but this will be the first one I write down.\r\n\r\nI commend it to your attention.  Jimmy Corey deserves his shot at The Big One.\r\n\r\n((Which frosts my ass.  Because if Jimmy actually WINS the Hugo, Ty will be unbearable.))\r\n\r\nP.S.  The EXPANSE tv series is amazing too.  Have you guys been watching season two?  I'm also going to be nominating \"Leviathan Wakes,\" the final episode of season one, for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.","ditemid":522877,"eventtime":"2017-02-27 12:54:00","props":{"current_mood":"impressed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, novels, awards, television","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Feb 27 19:54:49 2017]R [Mon Feb 27 19:54:50 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/836303598275428352 ","current_moodid":116,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1492274381,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/836303598275428352","give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.650415504137383]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1488225316}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2042?v=1488225293"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-02-27 19:54:49","anum":125,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html","event_timestamp":1488200040,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125442907/76855338","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?replyto=25768829","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25768829#t25768829","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25768829#t25768829","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25768829#t25768829","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sykiera","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sykiera.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25768829,"talkid":100659,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25768829#t25768829","upictitle":"sykiera: pic#125442907","article":"I will definitely take a look your recommendation on my next book store visit this weekend .

And it worked well enough... for decades... until the advent of the Sad and Rabid Puppies.<br /><br />Once the slates appeared, however, waiting ceased to be a viable option, because the final ballot was no longer representative of the best work of the previous year.<br /><br />In the present environment, the only way to get great work on the final ballot is to help put it there yourself, by nominating.  (And even that does not always work.  But it works better than waiting).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 months ago","ctime":"February 27 2017, 23:35:20 UTC","parent":25770109,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1488238520,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125617887/77094958","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?replyto=25770365","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770365#t25770365","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770365#t25770365","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770365#t25770365","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3397886","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153269284341716/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25770365,"talkid":100665,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770365#t25770365","upictitle":"Brendon Knoetze: pic#125617887","article":"I spotted these on your blog a while ago, and I must say, they are wonderful, fast paced exciting writers. <br /><br />I flew through the books, and told all my friends about them. <br /><br />When you see them next... tell them to hurry up with the next one... which reminds me....<br /><br />Thanks for the journeys ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 months ago","ctime":"February 27 2017, 20:52:23 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Completely agree - thanks ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153269284341716/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Brendon Knoetze","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3397886","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77094958&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Brendon Knoetze","ctime_ts":1488228743,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120743035/63422077","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?replyto=25770877","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770877#t25770877","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770877#t25770877","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770877#t25770877","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1785679","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/UTLonghorn1","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25770877,"talkid":100667,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522877.html?thread=25770877#t25770877","upictitle":"Sean Hall: pic#120743035","article":"Considering the sheer insane amount of fantasy and sci-fi books you've read in your lifetime compared to most people, I will definitely have to check this book series out.
