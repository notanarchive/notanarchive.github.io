{"itemid":757,"subject":"Ice & Fire Comes to Comics","event":"Whether you're an Ice & Fire reader or a funny book fan or both, I have cool news for you.  A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is coming to comics.  Random House/ Bantam Books has acquired the rights to do a graphic adaptation of the series, to be published as monthly comics (in partnership with Dynamite Entertainment) and as graphic novels in trade paperback format.\r\n\r\nThe comics will be scripted by DANIEL ABRAHAM, who should need no introduction to regular readers of this blog... but I'll give him one anyway.  Daniel is the author of ten books and more than thirty short stories, under his own name and the pseudonyms M.L.N. Hanover and James S.A. Corey (with Ty Franck).  He has been nominated for the Hugo, the Nebula, and the World Fantasy awards, and won the International Horror Guild Award.  Daniel's previous comic work includes the adaptation of my historical horror novel FEVRE DREAM for Avatar, and the original Wild Cards series THE HARD CALL for Dynamite and DBPro.  When not adapating my fantasy series, he's presently writing his own, THE DAGGER AND THE COIN.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000b1yy8/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000b1yy8/s640x480\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe series will be drawn by artist TOMMY PATTERSON, who won the gig over more than a dozen other artists from around the world who applied for the assignment and submitted samples.  With so much top rank talent to pick from, it was a tough choice, but Daniel and I and our editors at Bantam and Dynamite were all knocked out by the character sketchs and sample pages that Tommy submitted.\r\n\r\nJON SNOW\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dkcef/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dkcef/s640x480\" width=\"378\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nTommy's previous credits include FARSCAPE for Boom! Studios, the movie adaptation THE WARRIORS for Dynamite Entertainment, and TALES FROM WONDERLAND, THE WHITE KNIGHT, RED ROSE, and STINGERS from Zenescope Entertainment.  He holds a BS in Studio Art and also works as a graphic designer.  Patterson lives in Western Kentucky with his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nTYRION LANNISTER\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dpkk3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dpkk3/s640x480\" width=\"395\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe first issue of the monthly comic is scheduled to be published by Dynamite Entertainment in late spring 2011.  The graphic novel compilations will be published by Bantam.\r\n\r\n*** And yes, for those who were wondering, this was one of the infamous Two Big Announcements that I was originally hoping to make during my visit to Los Angeles in early January, before my holidays in the hospital knocked all my plans off the rails.","ditemid":194025,"eventtime":"2011-02-02 11:10:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"comics, a song of ice and fire","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1299045599,"personifi_word_count":394,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"42:11,16:4,17:8,29:6,3:36,19:5,25:6,4:25,20:13,9:17,31:8,22:5,11:6,nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-02-02 18:10:45","anum":233,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194025.html","event_timestamp":1296645000,"reply_count":57,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/83016750/296044","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194025.html?replyto=11918825","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194025.html?thread=11918825#t11918825","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194025.html?thread=11918825#t11918825","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194025.html?thread=11918825#t11918825","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mizkit","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mizkit.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11918825,"talkid":46557,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/194025.html?thread=11918825#t11918825","upictitle":"kit: takeachance_heroineaddict","article":"Oh, wow.
