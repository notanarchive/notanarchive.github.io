{"itemid":1671,"subject":"Conquest Bound","event":"I hear that everything is up to date in Kansas City, so I am heading that way to check it out for myself.  Next weekend I will be Editor Guest of Honor at Conquest, KC's long-running regional con, and one of my very favorites.  I went to my first KC con in 1972 (where I finally met Howard Waldrop, with whom I'd been exchanging letters since 1963), and have been coming back when I can ever since.  The 1976 worldcon in KC -- MidAmericon -- still ranks as the best worldcon of all time, in my not so humble opinion.  Even if I did lose two Hugos there.\r\n\r\nSo if any of you are in Kansas or Missouri or within driving distance, do come join us.  You can check out the basics on the con here: http://www.conquestkc.org/\r\n\r\nI should underline the fact that I am the <i><b>Editor</b></i> GOH at Conquest (Brandon Sanderson is the Author Guest of Honor).  I've been editing books just as long as I've been writing them (the first book I ever published was one I'd edited, not one I'd written), and to date I've been editor or co-editor on thirty-eight anthologies, with number thirty-nine on the way.  Yet this will be be the first time that any con has ever honored me for my editorial work.  \r\n\r\nYes, I will be reading a chapter from THE WINDS OF WINTER there, and yes, I'll talk about ICE AND FIRE and my other writing... but the emphasis at Conquest will be on my editing, especially the WILD CARDS series, and one of my two scheduled autograph sessions will be limited to the anthologies I've edited.  Just sayin'.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, I expect to find some burnt ends as well... dragon-charred, no doubt...","ditemid":427974,"eventtime":"2015-05-18 19:19:00","props":{"current_mood":"good","current_location":"Santa Fe... for now","taglist":"travels, anthologies, conventions","current_moodid":126,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1433455282,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Conquest Bound http://goo.gl/EUbm0g","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.612940807128893]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1431998418}","revtime":1433962686},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-05-19 01:19:45","anum":198,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427974.html","event_timestamp":1431976740,"reply_count":66,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124369075/73605194","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427974.html?thread=21661894#t21661894","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427974.html?thread=21661894#t21661894","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427974.html?thread=21661894#t21661894","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2927067","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/MeereeneseKnot","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21661894,"talkid":84616,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/427974.html?thread=21661894#t21661894","upictitle":"Ash: pic#124369075","article":"I'm very excited about next weekend!
