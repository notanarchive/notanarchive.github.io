The lion of liberalism, one of the great voices of his generation, a senator in the proud tradition of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster and Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\r\n\r\nHe will be missed.\r\n\r\nTeddy, Bobby, JFK.  What a remarkable family.  They were men like any other, not plaster saints, and had their share of failures and mistakes.  But they fought the good fight, and left the world a better place than they found it, and no more can be asked of any man.","ditemid":104066,"eventtime":"2009-08-26 11:57:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"scotland","personifi_word_count":86,"opt_nocomments":1,"taglist":"politics","current_moodid":25,"personifi_tags":"28:5,2:5,17:57,31:10,11:10,16:57,24:10,25:10,20:10,9:21,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-08-26 18:02:02","anum":130,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/104066.html","event_timestamp":1251287820,"reply_count":0}
