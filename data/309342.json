Eventually, they're going to run out of blades that people will purchase, and then what? Sell Hearteater, Widow's Wail, and Lion's Tooth in a Joffrey combo pack? Good grief.<br /><br />I don't think anyone is purchasing these blades at a premium because they're limited; they're purchasing these blades at a premium because they're devoted fans. Even if increasing production reduces Valyrian Steel's prices, the untapped demand that they'll reach means that they’ll make more money from more customers, which should more than compensate them for any losses. In addition, as production expands, economies of scale expand along with it, creating cost advantages which would further compensate Valyrian Steel for any price reductions stemming from increased production. Right now Valyrian Steel's self-imposed shortages are leaving most of the market untapped, and they're making less money as a result. Does that make any sense?<br /><br />The hallmark of a good policy is whether it takes account of the consequences which are unseen and unintended as well as those which are seen and intended. In this case, what is “seen and intended\" are a few elated fans and customers - lucky enough to find Valyrian Steel at the right time - but what is “unseen and unintended\" are all the many more disappointed, frustrated fans who would have been satisfied customers gone to waste. That's just bad business. Peter Drucker said that the sole purpose of any business is to create a customer (profits are simply a measure of how well the business is satisfying those customers), but by restricting production, Valyrian Steel is aborting untold numbers of customers. I would happily do business with Valyrian Steel for Ice - I would even consider paying more than they asked - but for whatever reason they have decided they don't want my money.

Eddi Reader's version is the best, IMO. I defy anyone not to think of Tywin Lannister, Joffrey's assassination attempt or Lord Stark's lonely fate, in these haunting lyrics.<br /><br />\"Ye Lannisters by name, lend an ear, lend an ear,<br />Ye Lannisters by name, lend an ear,<br />Ye Lannisters by name,<br />Your faults I will proclaim,<br />And your doctrines I maun blame, you shall hear.<br /><br />What's Right, and What is Wrong, by the law, by the Law?<br />What's Right and what is Wrong by the Law?<br />What's Right, and what is Wrong?<br />A weak arm and a strong?<br />A short sword, and a long, for to draw?<br /><br />What makes heroic strife, famed afar, famed afar?<br />What makes heroic strife famed afar?<br />What makes heroic strife?<br />To whet the assassin's knife,<br />Or haunt a Parent's life, wi' bloody war?<br /><br />Then let your schemes alone in the State, in the State,<br />Then let your schemes alone in the State.<br />Yes let your schemes alone,<br />Adore the rising sun,<br />And leave a man undone, to his fate\".<br /><br />The wildlings' soul is encapsulated in another Burns song, 'Wild Mountainside': I imagine Wildlings singing this, en masse, on their march to the Wall and exile. \"The last mile is upon us\", i.e. death. Evokes the Cheyenne's 'Trail of Tears', the Highland Clearances & the Irish Famine Diaspora. Eddi Reader's version is heart-breaking:<br /><br />\"Beauty is within grasp<br />Hear the islands call<br />The last mile is upon us<br />I'll carry you if you fall<br />I know the armour's heavy now<br />I know the heart is tired<br />It's beautiful just over<br />The wild mountainside<br /><br />Snow is falling all over<br />Out of clear blue skies<br />Crow is flying high over<br />You and I are going to wander<br />High up where the air is rare<br />Wild horses ride<br />It's beautiful, let's go over<br />The wild mountainside<br /><br />Wild and free we roam<br />Only a mile to go<br /><br />Wild and free we roam<br />Only a mile to go<br /><br />Beauty is within grasp<br />Hear the highlands call<br />The last mile is upon us<br />I'll carry you if you fall<br />I know the armour's heavy now<br />I know the heart inside<br />It's beautiful let's go over<br />The wild mountainside<br />It's beautiful just roaming<br />The wild mountainside\"<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"January 28 2013, 10:39:44 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Assassins&#39; Knives","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://gracht.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"gracht","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"gracht","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://gracht.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"January 28 2013, 12:03:27 UTC","dname":"gracht","ctime_ts":1359369584,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119962158/59997124","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213278#t17213278","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213278#t17213278","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213278#t17213278","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1619636","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/gsouzapr","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17213278,"talkid":67239,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213278#t17213278","upictitle":"Guilherme de Souza: pic#119962158","article":"May the Old and the New Gods and the Lord of Light hear you (also hoping they ship to Brazil)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"January 28 2013, 14:10:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/gsouzapr","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Guilherme de Souza","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1619636","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=59997124&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Guilherme de Souza","ctime_ts":1359382241,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115270933/45291777","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213534#t17213534","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213534#t17213534","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213534#t17213534","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_967928","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/TomIsAJerk","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17213534,"talkid":67240,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309342.html?thread=17213534#t17213534","upictitle":"Tom: pic#115270933","article":"Is there a level of implied autism in your character Stannis, or am I reading too much into it?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"January 28 2013, 21:48:20 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/TomIsAJerk","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"TomIsAJerk","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_967928","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=45291777&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"TomIsAJerk","ctime_ts":1359409700,"tracked":0}]}
