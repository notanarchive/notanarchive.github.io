{"itemid":1499,"subject":"Coolness at the Cocteau","event":"We had a great event at the Jean Cocteau Cinema last week, when Dennis Lehane came by to present his new movie, THE DROP.&nbsp;&nbsp; A fun interview, a busy booksigning, and a sold-out screening... everybody went away smiling, and Dennis seemed to enjoy his first visit to the Land of Enchantment, and promises to come back one of these days.&nbsp; He also signed a lot of stock for us, so if any of you out there are looking for an autographed copy of MYSTIC RIVER, SHUTTER ISLAND, THE GIVEN DAY, THE DROP, or any of Lehane&#39;s titles, contact the cinema.\r\n\r\nThe Cocteau schedule for this week will be even more exciting.&nbsp; On Sunday night, September 21, our friends NEIL GAIMAN and AMANDA PALMER will be paying us another visit, for an evening of singing, signing, and storytelling.&nbsp; The fun starts at 7pm... but, alas, if you don&#39;t have tickets yet, you&#39;re probably out of luck, since that event sold out within hours of us announcing it on our email newsletter.&nbsp; (Don&#39;t get our newsletter?&nbsp; Easily fixed.&nbsp; Go to the website at http://www.jeancocteaucinema.com/ and sign up.&nbsp; Newsletter subscribers get first crack at all of our coolest events).\r\n\r\nThe Cocteau will also be presenting THE COMPANY OF WOLVES, director Neil Jordan&#39;s twisted take on Little Red Riding Hood, based on the classic story by Angela Carter.&nbsp; Neil Gaiman picked this film for us, and we&#39;ve asked him to introduce it.&nbsp; The movie starts at 9:20.\r\n\r\nOur bar will be serving The Deflowering, a specialty cocktail designed for us by Amanda Palmer.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a busy Sunday.&nbsp; That&#39;s just the start, however.\r\n\r\nCome Wednesday, September 24, we have another very special event scheduled: a special advance screening of COPENHAGEN, a film by Mark Raso, fresh off the festival circuit and well in advance of its North American release.&nbsp; Here&#39;s the trailer:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"473\"/>\r\n\r\nDirector MARK RASO and star GETHIN ANTHONY will both be on hand for the COPENHAGEN screening, to introduce the film and answer your questions afterwards.&nbsp; Gethin, of course, is well known to GAME OF THRONES fans as the late, great Renly Baratheon,&nbsp; brother to Robert and Stannis, husband to Margaery Tyrell, lover of her brother Loras.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come meet him at the Jean Cocteau... advance tickets to the screening are still available at the Cocteau website.\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies.","ditemid":383812,"eventtime":"2014-09-18 13:03:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, movies, music, neil & amanda, movie theatre","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1412054453,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1412210083},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-09-18 19:01:52","anum":68,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383812.html","event_timestamp":1411045380,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123692389/50421741","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383812.html?thread=19541316#t19541316","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383812.html?thread=19541316#t19541316","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383812.html?thread=19541316#t19541316","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dragonborngurl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dragonborngurl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19541316,"talkid":76333,"etime_ts":"1411268689","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383812.html?thread=19541316#t19541316","upictitle":"L’esprit de l’escalier: pic#123692389","article":"Wow!  that looks truly like a film right up my ally!
