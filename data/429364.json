Given her tight touring schedule, we've had no choice but to cancel her appearance tonight at the Cocteau.\r\n\r\nWe will reschedule as soon as her schedule, and her own, permit.\r\n\r\nOur apologies for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\nThe Jean Cocteau will be having another terrific author event tomorrow (hmmm, actually it would be today now, looking at the clock -- anyway, Monday evening), when we welcome bestselling fantasist DEBORAH HARKNESS to Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nDeborah will be reading from her latest novel, THE BOOK OF LIFE.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/253626/253626_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/253732/253732_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nAfterward, Lorene Mills of REPORT FROM SANTA FE will be interviewing the author about her work, and Deborah will be signing copies of THE BOOK OF LIFE and her other novels.\r\n\r\nThe event starts at 7:00pm.
