{"itemid":141,"subject":"Polls Close Tuesday","event":"Just wanted to let everyone know that we will be closing the miniatures balloting on Tuesday.  That will be one full week, enough time for everyone to vote.\r\n\r\nBarring a flood of new votes in the last few days, it looks as though the winners will be Tyrion (overwhelmingly), Robb, Brienne, and the Red Viper.  Prince Oberyn leads the current fifth-place candidate, Asha Greyjoy, by over a hundred votes, and the margin is widening.\r\n\r\nI've never done one of these before, and I must say, I am finding the results fascinating.  So are my friends at Dark Sword.  Interestingly enough, on Dark Sword's other main lines -- the ranges based on the artwork of Larry Elmore and Keith Parkinson -- the hot babes in chainmail bikinis regularly outsell all other miniatures.  No woman in Westeros would be caught dead in a chainmail bikini, of course (well, actually, if a real woman warrior ever wore one of these things, she WOULD be found dead, and very quickly), but we still made sure to include several hot babes in our own list of choices.  \r\n\r\nWell, Asha Greyjoy is doing well enough, and will finish just out of the money, looks like... but Shae and Arianne Martell are both bringing up the rear, running behind even Prince Joffrey at this juncture.  Instead my readers want a dwarf, a bisexual Dornishman, and the homeliest woman in the Seven Kingdoms.  Okay.  \r\n\r\nSo what does that mean?  Are my readers less horny than Elmore and Parkinson fans?  Do they have something against scantily clad women?  Is it my large female readership weighing in against sexist stereotypes in fantasy?  Is it more just a reflection on the specific characters (Asha's strong showing would suggest that)?\r\n\r\nInteresting to speculate, anyway...\r\n\r\nThe characters who don't make the cut this time will have another shot somewhere down the line, have no fear.  So long as you guys keep buying these, Dark Sword will keep making more, and we hope to get to everyone eventually.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to all of you who voted.  The turnout has been astonishing.","ditemid":36136,"eventtime":"2008-02-16 19:33:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":350,"commentalter":1204739112,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","verticals_list":"life"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-17 02:56:59","anum":40,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html","event_timestamp":1203190380,"reply_count":80,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/54796324/11644701","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?replyto=3494184","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494184#t3494184","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494184#t3494184","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494184#t3494184","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"iweardogpajamas","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://iweardogpajamas.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3494184,"talkid":13649,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494184#t3494184","upictitle":"iweardogpajamas: dog pajamas","article":"I laughed a lot reading this entry :D","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 17 2008, 03:04:56 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://iweardogpajamas.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"iweardogpajamas","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"iweardogpajamas","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://iweardogpajamas.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"iweardogpajamas","ctime_ts":1203217496,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/70115795/6425493","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?replyto=3494440","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494440#t3494440","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494440#t3494440","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494440#t3494440","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"omgtehbets","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://omgtehbets.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3494440,"talkid":13650,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3494440#t3494440","upictitle":"Warboss Gungerdak Gaz-bhut: slipshine","article":"I voted for Tyrion Lannister simply because he is one of my favorite characters in all of literature!

Why? Because all the others seem like they'd be awfully generic in miniature form. Admittedly, I'm not the kind of person who buys miniatures, so my viewpoint is bound to seem ridiculously uncouth and uneducated to the kind of person who does. But it's a choice between three handsome yet normal-shaped knights/lords, three fairly generic ladies (or two generic ladies and a generic robe-encased female), a generic swordswoman (with or without a chainmail bikini, it makes not a lot of difference), and a fat man, a dwarf, and a spectacularly hideous female warrior? Bear in mind that the characters themselves are in no way generic, I'm just saying the shape of them is, which is what I think of when I think of miniatures. If I had a miniature collection, I imagine that Tyrion, Samwell, and Brienne would stand out, while the others would blend right in.<br /><br />But again, that's just me, not the perspective the people who matter. But I'd imagine a roughly congruent line of thought might have tipped the balance against the pretty girls.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years

I play Warhammer, and several of the citadel miniatures ranges feature nude or nearly-nude women, and they seem to be pretty popular.  But honestly, if I'm feeling the need to peer at the naked ladies, I either talk to my girlfriend about it, or, use this wondrous thing called the internet.  (Which is, after all, for porn.)  I just can't see how inch-tall plastic or metal models, where even the best ones are far from life-like, are supposed to be so great.  The modeling, no matter how skilled, won't match up to illustrations or imagination.    And when it comes to painting, forget about it.  Armor, shields, cloaks, robes all present many superior opportunities to  create interesting artwork.  Besides, if one wants to use the models for a wargame, they might as well be plausible.  <br /><br />I imagine if I was 25mm tall, and made of metal, that I'd have a rather different perspective on it.

I'm sure some readers who want the Tyrion figure for <i>who</i> it represents are very happy to also buy a Chick in Chainmail for <i>what</i> she represents.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"February 17 2008, 04:42:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://barbarienne.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"barbarienne","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"barbarienne","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://barbarienne.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"barbarienne","ctime_ts":1203223330,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/38797157/2870539","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?replyto=3500840","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3500840#t3500840","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3500840#t3500840","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3500840#t3500840","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"redcrossknight","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://redcrossknight.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3500840,"talkid":13675,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36136.html?thread=3500840#t3500840","upictitle":"Jimbo!: Blue Beetle","article":"Personally, it's either the character himself, or the look of the character that makes the most impact in my decision-making process for which figurine to buy.
