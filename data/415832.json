As a young boy I rooted for my team no mater how futile I knew it may be. I'm not trying to disrespect Steve Grogan or, Drew Bledsoe but, Tom Brady has been a godsend for us Pats fans. Let us enjoy being winners while we can. Let us enjoy our time in the sun. Tom will probably retire in a couple of years and, Bill will probably too. Till then let us enjoy not sucking the way we did in the 80's and 90's. That was one hell of a Superbowl and Seattle brought it to us. I agree that they should have ran the ball on that last play. I still don't understand why they didn't make that call. As a Patriots fan I was expecting that and, expecting another Superbowl loss. Seattle however made the call they made and we have to give credit to Gerard Butler for that fantastic interception. Wow! In my opinion that was one of the greatest Superbowls I have ever witnessed.
