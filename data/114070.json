Beautiful production values (but for some notable typos that slipped through the cracks, I admit), but more importantly, some really wonderful stories. I particularly took pleasure in the afterwords from the authors following their stories, showing how each and every one of them came to admire Vance's work (Howard Waldrop's was the most moving, in my mind).<br /><br />Dan Simmons wrote the story which I think is probably my favorite, but really, it's an embarrassment of riches. And leave it to you to capture the flavor of Vance's blackest humor; Molloqos the Melancholy, the toad-like Chimwazzle, and Lirianne with her razor sharp Tickle-Me-Sweet fit right into the setting. <br /><br />The first time I came across the Dying Earth, it was through \"Mazirian the Magician\" when I was somewhere in 7th-8th grade. It was collected in Asimov's, Greenberg's, and Waugh's anthology series, <em>Magical Worlds</em>. I remember the cover, which was my first exposure to Kinuko Kraft, too. All the stories were supposed to feature wizards, and I still remember reading some of these stories quite vividly: Le Guin's heartbreaking beautiful \"Semley's Necklace\" (part of her Ekumen setting, but I knew nothing about that then), REH's dark Conan adventure \"The People of the Black Circle\", Larry Niven's \"What Good is a Glass Dagger?\"...<br /><br />But Mazirian and the Dying Earth beat them all for magic and wonder. Of course, I never could find the Dying Earth novels in the local libraries I had access to right then, nor in the bookstores. It took a number of years to rediscover Vance, which I did when you reminded me of him in a very early e-mail. You explained the origins of the Vance name in the series, and that triggered a memory, and next thing I knew I was ordering the book through the Internet.<br /><br />So thanks for that (though the shelves do groan under the collection of Vance books I've amassed since then), and for this book (which'll sit near the rest, to keep them company).","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"7 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"October 9 2009, 20:39:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hippoiathanatoi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hippoiathanatoi","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hippoiathanatoi","ctime_ts":1255120767,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114070.html?replyto=7725206","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114070.html?thread=7725206#t7725206","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114070.html?thread=7725206#t7725206","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114070.html?thread=7725206#t7725206","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tomburkesbastar","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tomburkesbastar.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7725206,"talkid":30176,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/114070.html?thread=7725206#t7725206","upictitle":"tomburkesbastar: pic#0","article":"And it is awesome!
