{"itemid":635,"subject":"Ser Ilyn Payne","event":"I've been looking over tapes of half a dozen actors auditioning for the part of Ser Ilyn Payne in the HBO series.  The strangest auditions I've ever watched, since all the actors do is stand there and react silently to the lines being read at 'em.\r\n\r\nNo decision on Ser Ilyn yet, BTW.  But soon, I think.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though, the talented folks over at Dark Sword Miniatures are about to issue their own version of Ser Ilyn, sculpted by Jeff Grace.
