At the latest when Daenerys is going to be participating in certain \"sales negotiations\" that will need to be subtitled from (a dialect of) High Valyrian.  There is also mention of a haunting song in High Valyrian -- another opportunity to show off the language.<br /><br />There will also be some on-screen Braavosi, which is partially based on Valyrian.  It might also be nice to strew in a few phrases of Lyseni or Myrish here and there, which should be recognizably derived from High Valyrian stock.<br /><br />Thus, ideally, the entire family (High Valyrian, \"Vulgar Valyrian\" spoken in SB, Braavosi, Lyseni, Myrish etc.) should be designed in one go to ensure internal consistency; it would be tricky to achieve that retroactively.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 4 2011, 16:18:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Speaking of Languages...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://zhalio.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"zhalio","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"zhalio","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://zhalio.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"zhalio","ctime_ts":1309796332,"tracked":0}]}
