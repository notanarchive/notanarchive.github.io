{"itemid":70,"subject":"RIP, Bill Walsh","event":"Back during the heydey of Bill Parcells' first great New York Giants teams, roughly 1985 through 1990, our greatest rivals were the San Francisco 49ers of Bill Walsh.  As a Giants fan, my fondest memories of are the times we beat the Niners -- the drubbing we gave them in the playoffs on the way to our first SuperBowl, the 15-13 squeaker we won in San Francisco on the way to the second SuperBowl, when we frustrated the Niners' dreams of Threepeat, and (especially) that incredible regular season game where Mark Bavaro carried Ronnie Lott and ten other 49ers halfway down the field on his back.  I'm sure there were some equally exciting games where the Niners prevailed, though of course I don't remember THOSE as fondly.  Still, those were great games between two great teams.  \r\n\r\nDespite the rivalry, I could never hate the Niners the way I hate the Cowboys (as a Giants fan) or the Patriots and Dolphins (as a Jets fan).  Bill Walsh was just too classy, and so were his teams.  Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Dwight Clark, Ronnie Lott, so many more.  They weren't my guys, but they were great players, and easy to root for.  And I did root for them, whenever my own guys weren't in it.  I was cheering as hard as anyone when Montana threw and Dwight Clark made the Catch, to knock the hated Cowboys out of the playoffs.  And that drive against the Bengals in the SuperBowl was pretty special too.\r\n\r\nBill Walsh was the most innovative football coach of our time.  He redefined the game, especially on offense.  He always seemed to be a great guy too.  His players loved him, and with good reason.  I remember the first Niner SuperBowl against the Bengals, where he got to the hotel ahead of the team, dressed up as a bellhop, and unloaded their luggage for them.\r\n\r\nYou'll never see Evil Little Bill do that.\r\n\r\nRest In Peace, Bill.  You did good work and left your mark, and that's all that any man can hope for.","ditemid":17968,"eventtime":"2007-07-30 23:00:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","commentalter":1190042505,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-07-31 05:16:05","anum":48,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html","event_timestamp":1185836400,"reply_count":71,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/44506409/8072903","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?replyto=2156848","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2156848#t2156848","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2156848#t2156848","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2156848#t2156848","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"lodengarl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://lodengarl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2156848,"talkid":8425,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2156848#t2156848","upictitle":"lodengarl: BwB","article":"Redefined the way for sure - classy, strategic, and potent.

Pray","article":"I am saddened by this. Although his 49ers eventually became smug and beat my equally smug Giants too many times, Bill Walsh was always something of a hero to me.<br /><br />Why? Because he was real smart. Although brilliant coaches existed before Walsh, in my consciousness, he was the first coach who did not embody the grizzled, beat-em-up, military mentality that comes with the position.<br /><br />Instead, Walsh was the cool, competent genius who crafted a new offense from scratch. The NFL of the 70s was a static place. You ran the ball and you threw deep. Teams employed deep threats down the field and a power running game. This was the status quo (except for Air Coryell in San Diego, which had alot of the deep threats and little of the running game.) Walsh create a new offense, a West Coast Offense that saw a way to do add the benefits of a running game (time of possession, manageable downs) to the passing game. This helped make it possible for teams to start to break away from the run-first mentality. If it wasn't for Walsh showing the NFL how a passing game need not be the big-risk portion of a playbook, then the current offenses of Indianapolis, New England, and Philadelphia (not to mention the Run-N-Shoot, Oakland a few years ago, Minneosota and other pass-friendly offenses) may never have existed. Walsh didn't just create a new offense, he initiated a culture change. With Walsh receivers became bigger, more surehanded, better able to run the quick slant and bounce off tacklers. Running backs were prized not just for being strong, but being able to pass protect and catch passes out of the backfield. QBs didn't need to have rocket arms as reading coverages, moving in the pocket and accuracy were more important. Teams didn't have to beat the crap out of each other until the blood ran out, now they could systematically and efficiently move down the field, a machine adjusting all the fly, brains beating brawn.<br /><br />I always prefer the coaches who create new things, not just demand the old things. Dungy and his Tampa-2, Belichick and his \"kitchen sink\", Urban Meyer and his option, D'antoni and his \"7 Seconds or Less and many others remind me that sports isn't just a place for the brawny and \"tough\", its for the bold, daring, ingenious and the (guess what?) still tough.<br /><br />I'm hoping that that someone in the new generation of coaching will have the same amount of courage, smart and bravery that Bill Walsh had.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"July 31 2007, 14:10:47 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://paladincub21.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"paladincub21","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"paladincub21","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://paladincub21.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"paladincub21","ctime_ts":1185891047,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?replyto=2159152","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2159152#t2159152","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2159152#t2159152","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2159152#t2159152","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"brandonlc","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://brandonlc.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2159152,"talkid":8434,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2159152#t2159152","upictitle":"brandonlc: pic#71319768","article":"I have friend who is a die hard 49ers fan who is probably on suicide death watch over this.

He would always prefer to cut a player a year too early instead of a year too late, but at the same time few coaches are revered as highly for the honesty and respect he showed his players.  <br /><br />On top of all that, he was universally regarded as a gentleman off the field.<br /><br />RIP Bill Walsh.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"July 31 2007, 18:07:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bazzlebane.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bazzlebane","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bazzlebane","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bazzlebane.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bazzlebane","ctime_ts":1185905262,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/21319244/1122555","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?replyto=2160432","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2160432#t2160432","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2160432#t2160432","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2160432#t2160432","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"thatdamnninja","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://thatdamnninja.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2160432,"talkid":8439,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17968.html?thread=2160432#t2160432","upictitle":"A Very Friendly Asshole: NEVER FORGET","article":"<br />GO NINERS!!
