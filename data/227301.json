{"itemid":887,"subject":"Signing Tomorrow!","event":"For the New Mexicans out there... I will be signing copies of the new Wild Cards mosaic novel, FORT FREAK, tomorrow at Page One Bookstore.  The signing starts at 2:30 pm and will run till about 5:00 pm, depending...\r\n\r\nAlso on hand to deface your copies of FORT FREAK will be my assistant editor Melinda M. Snodgrass (Franny Black), John Jos. Miller (Father Squid), and Victor Milan (Ratboy and Flipper).  Other Wild Cards contributors may also drop by... and if they do, Page One will have copies of the earlier books in the series for them to scrawl in.\r\n \r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g8drp/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g8drp/s640x480\" width=\"315\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere will also be a brief presentation about Wild Cards, and a Q&A session.\r\n\r\nFor more details about the signing, check out the Page One website at \r\nhttp://www.page1book.com/\r\n\r\nI should stress that this is a Wild Cards signing.  NO COPIES OF DANCE WITH DRAGONS WILL BE ON SALE!  I may be able to autograph some of your Ice & Fire books, if time permits, but probably not more than one, and only with a purchase of FORT FREAK.  And in the talk and the Q&A session, we'll be talking about Wild Cards, not the new Ice & Fire book or the HBO show.  Sorry, but to let GAME OF THRONES take over the session would not be fair to the other writers.\r\n\r\nSo drop on in to Page One, and pay a visit to Fort Freak.","ditemid":227301,"eventtime":"2011-07-08 18:36:00","props":{"taglist":"tor, wild cards, signings","commentalter":1310264778,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"lohengrin","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1310265860},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-09 00:36:44","anum":229,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html","event_timestamp":1310150160,"reply_count":7,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/86500480/8672831","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14206693#t14206693","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14206693#t14206693","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14206693#t14206693","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"danniebrown","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://danniebrown.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14206693,"talkid":55494,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14206693#t14206693","upictitle":"danniebrown: me","article":"Just received my copy of Wild Cards I with the gorgeous, gorgeous cover of Michael Komarck (I should have known!), thanks a lot for advertising it a few days ago, I'm already hooked!<br /><br />Maybe someday I'll even get the chance to have it signed by you. ;)<br /><br />All the best for the signing.<br /><br />Nadine (France)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 9 2011, 11:44:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://danniebrown.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"danniebrown","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"danniebrown","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://danniebrown.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"danniebrown","ctime_ts":1310211861,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110501783/33279968","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14207717#t14207717","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14207717#t14207717","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14207717#t14207717","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rawr_balrog","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rawr-balrog.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14207717,"talkid":55498,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/227301.html?thread=14207717#t14207717","upictitle":"Shannon: konzen and goku","article":"My friend sent me a picture message with a photograph of ADWD on the shelves/for sale up in the Northeastern PA area (I think the one in Hazleton, though he could have been in Wilkes-Barre at the time) last night.
