{"itemid":1997,"subject":"Three Thoughts","event":"Just a grab bag of thoughts and opinions I've been meaning to share... \r\n\r\nI never had the honor of meeting John Glenn, but his death saddened me.  The last of the Mercury Seven.  I am old enough to remember when NASA first introduced them to the world... and incidentally coined the term \"astronaut\" (before that, we called them \"spacemen\").  The dawn of the space age!  An age, sadly, that now seems to be passing, at least insofar as manned exploration is concerned.  If you had asked me in 1961, I would have said by 2017 we would certainly have a base on the moon, and maybe one on Mars.  Hard to believe all seven are gone.  They were all heroes to me.\r\n\r\nNow that WESTWORLD has finished its first season, I see that HBO is going to be rerunning its crime and courtroom drama, THE NIGHT OF.  If you missed it last time, don't make that mistake again.  Yes, it's very dark, but damn, this is brilliant television, with a bravura performance by John Turturro at its heart that ought to win him a whole shelf full of awards, if there is any justice.\r\n\r\nEmily St. John Mandel appeared at the Jean Cocteau Cinema last month (you can find my post about her downstream), and I had the honor of interviewing her.  I had long been an admirer of her SF novel, STATION ELEVEN, which I thought deserving of a Hugo nod... but at the time of her appearance, I had not read any of her three earlier novels.  She was such a charming and fascinating guest, however, that I made up for that lack afterward, and now I am even more impressed with her talent than I was before.  LAST NIGHT IN MONTREAL, THE SINGER'S GUN, and THE LOLA QUARTET are not science fiction or fantasy -- don't know how to characterize them, \"literary noir\" is about the best I can do -- but damned, they are good.   Fascinating characters, original stories, and such gorgeous prose.  Rich, evocative, beautiful writing, but never intrusive.  She makes her people and her places come alive in a way that draws you in and will not let you go.   I can't wait to read what she does next.","ditemid":511306,"eventtime":"2016-12-12 17:36:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"writing, life and death, television","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Dec 13 00:36:02 2016]R [Tue Dec 13 00:36:03 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/808470503841116160 ","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1481841830,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/808470503841116160","picture_keyword":"uk","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.655443866257394]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1481589383}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1997?v=1481917989","revtime":1481917987},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-12-13 00:36:01","anum":74,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511306.html","event_timestamp":1481564160,"reply_count":36,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117796605/50627511","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511306.html?thread=25397066#t25397066","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511306.html?thread=25397066#t25397066","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511306.html?thread=25397066#t25397066","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511306.html?thread=25397066#t25397066","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1271338","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RaUL_AMDERLAINE","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25397066,"talkid":99207,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/511306.html?thread=25397066#t25397066","upictitle":"RaUL AMDERLAINE: pic#117796605","article":"If you were writing Westworld, what would you make of Season 2, in broad strokes?
