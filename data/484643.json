{"itemid":1893,"subject":"NFL Draft, Day Two","event":"The second and third rounds of the NFL draft have come and gone.\r\n\r\nMy guys made some promising picks today.  The Giants picked up Sterling Shepard, a young wideout out of Oklahoma who is said to be quick and elusive, with the best hands in this draft class.  If he is all they say he is, Eli will finally have someone else to throw to beside Odell, someone who will not (we can hope) drop the ball.  And if Victor Cruz comes back as well, the G-Men should have a hell of a passing game.  Shepard should also be a big help in the return game.  Next round, Big Blue added Darian Thompson, a ball-hawking safety.  That can't hurt either.  Their defense needs all the players they can get.\r\n\r\nThe Jets did well in the third by picking a linebacker out of Georgia by the name of Jordan Jenkins.  The talking heads on ESPN and the NFL Network all seem to like him a lot, and a couple said he is better than his more heralded teammate Leonard Floyd, who went early in round one.  Looks like this guy will be a solid pass rusher, and the more big bodies we have to get after Tom Brady, the better off Gang Green will be.\r\n\r\nAll the talk is about the Jets' second round pick, however.  They went for a quarterback, Penn State's Christian Hackenberg.   A lot of controversy on that pick.  \"Hack\" was a freshman sensation under Bill O'Brien who then wilted in his sophomore and junior years under lesser coaches.  I saw him in person last year, when I attended Northwestern's home game against Penn State in Evanston.  He lost that game.  He's lost a lot of other games too.  Will be thrive with the Jets?  Maybe.  He has gifts.  One can hope.  One can dream.  But...\r\n\r\nBut he's sure not going to be ready to start this year.  And Fitz is still not signed.  So who will quarterback the Jets?  And does this mean that Fitz will not be resigned?  I sure hope not.  If he does come back, who is the odd man out?  The Jets can't carry four quarterbacks.  Does this mean they have given up on Bryce Petty already?  Or... \r\n\r\n... maybe they can trade Geno Smith.  For a sixth.  Or a seventh.  Or a player.   Or...","ditemid":484643,"eventtime":"2016-04-30 00:10:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Apr 30 06:09:59 2016]R [Sat Apr 30 06:10:00 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/726292500495798273 ","current_moodid":43,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1462228764,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/726292500495798273","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.627891895597729]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1461996769}","revtime":1462941662},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-30 06:09:58","anum":35,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484643.html","event_timestamp":1461975000,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484643.html?thread=24338467#t24338467","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484643.html?thread=24338467#t24338467","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484643.html?thread=24338467#t24338467","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3632814","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/105245726735019012423","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24338467,"talkid":95072,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/484643.html?thread=24338467#t24338467","upictitle":"James Larsen: pic#0","article":"I like what the Giants have done so far in the draft, especially with Apple and Shepard.

I don’t mean actual medieval warfare, but specifically organized martial contests and feats of arms. Football, with its pageantry, ritual, tactics, and, at the most basic level, large men in heraldically decorated armour competing for the adulation of the crowds, bears some superficial similarities to a tourney.<br /><br />I’m also intrigued by the distinction you appear to make between the more ritualized competition of the joust and the genuine fight-to-the-death-as-spectacle practised in the cities of Slaver’s Bay and in the Bronze Arena of Lyronica (or even in the terrarium of the dastardly Simon Kress). I really liked how you use these situations as a way to probe the social controls placed on the role of violence and aggression. For example, at the Tourney of the Hand, everything is fine up until the Mountain goes berserk. It’s intriguing that two men riding at one another full tilt with lances is socially acceptable – indeed, commendable! – but the raw brutality of Ser Gregor’s outburst is universally condemned by his peers. Suddenly, the violence becomes all too real, like a fight breaking out in a hockey game. Conversely, there was the Knight of the Laughing Tree, who used the formalized, artificial setting of the joust to resolve a real conflict (the bullying of Howland Reed). Thought-provoking stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, best of luck to your teams next season!
