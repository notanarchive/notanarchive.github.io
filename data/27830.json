Loved Tuf Voyaging, couldn't quite get into Fevre Dream though I read most of it, and stalled out early on with Dying of the Light.  (Though I'm not saying these aren't good books; I'm more saying steam-boating vampires might not be \"my thing\")  So I kind of wanted to \"test drive\" the Wild Card Series with a cheap used book or two before I invested a lot in a new series.<br />Sadly, I just cannot seem to find the first book of the original series.  Volume five seems especially prevalent for some reason - maybe there was a larger print run, but for some reason a lot of the used stores I've been to have multiple copies of <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%235\">#5</a> and very few if any of the others.<br />I know this may be a longshot, but what are the chances of putting the text of the first volume online at the official Wildcards website?  Maybe one short story per week for a few weeks as a special preview for the new series?  Copyright issues may or may not make it possible, but this sort of marketing has worked well in other medias.  In addition, it's not like the writers are seeing any money off of used sales.<br />Plus, we all might be able to avoid that stink of old cigarette smoke that so many used fantasy and sci-fi books accumulate for some reason.  lol","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"December 17 2007, 20:27:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Original Wildcards","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thornghost.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thornghost","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thornghost","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thornghost.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thornghost","ctime_ts":1197923227,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27830.html?replyto=2900150","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27830.html?thread=2900150#t2900150","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27830.html?thread=2900150#t2900150","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27830.html?thread=2900150#t2900150","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2900150,"talkid":11328,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/27830.html?thread=2900150#t2900150","above":2899638,"upictitle":"George R.R.
