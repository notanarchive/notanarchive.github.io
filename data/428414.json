Have you heard of the County Theater in Doylestown, PA? It's the iconic indie movie theater I grew up with and love. It's had its ups and downs but has managed to survive since the late 1930s, and still keep its same 1930s look! <br /><br />Back in '94 (a few years after almost shutting down for good) they managed to get Pulp Fiction. It was a real triumph for them.<br /><br /><a href='http://countytheater.org/history' rel='nofollow'>http://countytheater.org/history</a>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","below":21711230,"ctime":"June 7 2015, 16:22:08 UTC","parent":21692542,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bungeebot","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bungeebot","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bungeebot.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bungeebot","ctime_ts":1433694128,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124819199/75167376","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428414.html?thread=21711230#t21711230","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428414.html?thread=21711230#t21711230","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428414.html?thread=21711230#t21711230","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"linnymay","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://linnymay.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21711230,"talkid":84809,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/428414.html?thread=21711230#t21711230","above":21697918,"upictitle":"Linny May: pic#124819199","article":"Yeah, hardly a myth considering the federal antitrust lawsuit.
