I'm quite familiar with the original in English, where the text flows so smoothly that it doesn't become tiresome. Unfortunately, that's not what happened here in Brazil. The translator has adopted a style that is way too distant from the original. The reading is heavy and the words are difficult (I couldn't understand some of them, which didn't happen when I read it in English - and I'm Brazilian!). When I heard about a national version, I expected something quite different from what we got here. But, anyway, new readers don't seem troubled by that. The ones I know are getting really deep into the series, and becoming huge fans like me. It just seems to me they'll have different feelings about the books, like something more distant and old-styled.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"April 15 2011, 01:16:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"A Song of Ice and Fire by Edgar Allan Poe","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://theblanka.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"theblanka","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"theblanka","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://theblanka.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"theblanka","ctime_ts":1302830212,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209834.html?replyto=12957866","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209834.html?thread=12957866#t12957866","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209834.html?thread=12957866#t12957866","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209834.html?thread=12957866#t12957866","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209834.html?thread=12957866#t12957866","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12957866,"talkid":50616,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/209834.html?thread=12957866#t12957866","above":12957610,"upictitle":"George R.R.
