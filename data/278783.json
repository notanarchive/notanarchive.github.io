Don't trust any review from a magazine which you have to purchase...buy the mag if you want more info, but keep an objective perspective.  And, never base your purchases on the metacritic or any numerical rating...it's just a marketing tool...the higher numbers are reserved for AAA titles which they have been told will need a high rating during the same release season as other titles which they have been told can't have a higher number as the designated AAA titles.  This information was leaked to us by an employee who was fired for not following the \"recommended\" rating levels.<br /><br />If you really enjoy G.R.R.M's works and he has authorized the game then do buy it when it first comes out and enjoy being in Westeros.
