{"itemid":1257,"subject":"NFL Draft","event":"Round two of the NFL Draft kicks off in about an hour.  Rumors are flying on the sports sites that the Jets are trying to trade up from the seventh slot to draft a QB.  Boy, I sure hope not.  None of the QBs available this year impress me as being much of an upgrade over Sanchez and Garrard.  Maybe if one fell into their laps in, say, the third round... but in the second?  When the team desperately needs help at so many positions?  And trading UP to get him, which means giving up a lower round pick?  That would be as foolish as trading away Revis.\r\n\r\nThe Jets flourished when Rex could run a ground-and-pound O.  They have lost Shonn Greene, their starting RB.  They should stay where they are and take the RB out of Alabama if he's still there at seven.  \r\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the first round picks.  All the mock drafts had the Jets getting Mingo and Austin at #9 and #13 in the first round.  Wrong and wrong.  The Browns took Mingo, and the the Rams traded up into the #8 slot ahead of the Jets to get Tavon.  Once more, another team drank our milkshake.  \r\n\r\nLet us not compound the problems by chasing any of these QBs.  Not one of them is a sure thing.  Give me Eddie Lacy instead, and bring back the ground-and-pound.  Sanchez plays best with play action, and that requires a strong ground game.","ditemid":322033,"eventtime":"2013-04-26 15:37:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":134,"commentalter":1367085832,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1367086097},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-04-26 21:36:56","anum":241,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html","event_timestamp":1366990620,"reply_count":38,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114075653/43583940","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17644273#t17644273","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17644273#t17644273","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17644273#t17644273","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17644273#t17644273","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_861360","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/108204837493261951664","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17644273,"talkid":68922,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17644273#t17644273","upictitle":"Awet M: pic#114075653","article":"Not a word about the Big Blue Machine?

I really thought Jets were planning to bomb this year so that they could get Johnny Football, if that was the case why take Geno?  If there is a silver lining to this pick, it is Geno's performance against Baylor: 45/51 completions, 656 yards, 8 TDs and 0 interceptions.  The rest of the season didn't go quite as well, regardless those are numbers not to be scoffed at.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 27 2013, 03:29:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Geno Smith","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mateoblanco.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mateoblanco","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mateoblanco","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mateoblanco.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mateoblanco","ctime_ts":1367033340,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120695099/63287643","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652721#t17652721","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652721#t17652721","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652721#t17652721","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1776018","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/0marc0min","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17652721,"talkid":68955,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652721#t17652721","upictitle":"Rob: pic#120695099","article":"At least we get to say Winter is coming.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 27 2013, 04:16:09 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Brian Winters","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/0marc0min","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"0marc0min","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1776018","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=63287643&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"0marc0min","ctime_ts":1367036169,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/115722683/8270537","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652977#t17652977","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652977#t17652977","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652977#t17652977","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"_wish_me_luck_","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://users.livejournal.com/-wish-me-luck-/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17652977,"talkid":68956,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17652977#t17652977","upictitle":"антропоморфная молодая мышь: sith mouse","article":"And there is still a chance they will sign Matt Barkley too...)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"April 27 2013, 04:34:48 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://users.livejournal.com/-wish-me-luck-/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"_wish_me_luck_","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"_wish_me_luck_","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://users.livejournal.com/-wish-me-luck-/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"_wish_me_luck_","ctime_ts":1367037288,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119643222/57084187","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17654257#t17654257","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17654257#t17654257","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17654257#t17654257","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1558242","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/douglascfisher","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17654257,"talkid":68961,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/322033.html?thread=17654257#t17654257","above":17652977,"upictitle":"Douglas Fisher: pic#119643222","article":"Jets new plan?
