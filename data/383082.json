{"itemid":1496,"subject":"NFL Week One","event":"The Jets won and the Giants lost, but I can&#39;t even say the glass is half full.\r\n\r\nThe Jets win was over the Oakland Raiders.&nbsp; A lot of the commentators on the sports channels seem to think the Raiders may be the worst team in the league this year... and yet the Jets bared squeaked out the win.&nbsp; Their defense looked stout, and they dominated, but the offense kept shooting themselves in the foot.&nbsp; WAY too many penalties, and while Geno had his moments, he also had two fumbles and an interception, which suggests he going to be a turnover machine once again.&nbsp; I am still not certain that the Jets have a quarterback.&nbsp; Gang Green won this week, but the schedule gets a lot harder in the weeks to come, and if Geno keeps turning over the ball at that rate, we aren&#39;t going to win many more games.\r\n\r\nAs for the G-Men, those people I quoted above who think the Raiders may be the worst team in the league obviously did not see the Giants lose to the Lions tonight.&nbsp; What a debacle.&nbsp; The new offense... well, no one seemed to be on the same page, and Eli threw two INTs... part of which was the confusion, and part of which was the O line, which gave him no protection.&nbsp; No running game to speak of either, and none of the Giants wideouts seemed to want to catch the ball, not even Victor Cruz.\r\n\r\nThis could be a very long season.&nbsp; I&#39;ll watch, of course.&nbsp; I&#39;m a fan, and that&#39;s what a true fan does, no matter how painful it gets.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t promise to post every week about Sunday&#39;s games.&nbsp; I am too busy and too tired, and somehow what started out as fun became a sort of obligation, so... I will post when I have something to say.\r\n\r\nAt least the Cowboys and the Patriots both lost.&nbsp; THAT was fun.&nbsp;","ditemid":383082,"eventtime":"2014-09-09 00:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"gloomy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":38,"commentalter":1410564180,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs down","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1410740416},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-09-09 06:11:12","anum":106,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html","event_timestamp":1410221460,"reply_count":36,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/99793990/25746361","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515498#t19515498","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515498#t19515498","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515498#t19515498","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dothraki","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dothraki.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19515498,"talkid":76232,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515498#t19515498","upictitle":"David Peterson: D for Dothraki","article":"If instead of rooting for the Jets and Giants you focus instead on rooting <i>against</i> the Patriots and Cowboys, I predict you'll be in for a surprisingly fun season.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"September 9 2014, 06:22:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"As a Raiders Fan...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dothraki.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dothraki","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dothraki","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dothraki.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dothraki","ctime_ts":1410243738,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123903486/72071300","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515754#t19515754","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515754#t19515754","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515754#t19515754","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2738803","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/OberynMattell","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19515754,"talkid":76233,"etime_ts":"1410250905","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19515754#t19515754","upictitle":"Oberyn Mattell: pic#123903486","article":"Watched the Giants as well, very depressing. <br /><br />The offense seemed to pick up steam in the 2nd quarter when they went no huddle and Eli out of the shot gun, then for whatever reason they went away from that in the 2nd half. <br /><br />The tight end Larry Donnell actually surprised me, will be nice if he can develop into a reliable passing option. <br /><br />The defense showed some nice flashes at times, but too many break downs in the passing game (and especially on 3rd and long), and I think they were tired later in the game.

I must also be a true fan, because I will continue watching, regardless of what they are: 0-1, going on 0-2.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"September 9 2014, 16:01:44 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"No Excuses","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/brad.buckles","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Brad Buckles","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2507292","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69751232&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Brad Buckles","ctime_ts":1410278504,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109915172/10560429","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19518314#t19518314","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19518314#t19518314","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19518314#t19518314","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"nycfalcon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19518314,"talkid":76243,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/383082.html?thread=19518314#t19518314","upictitle":"nycfalcon: pic#109915172","article":"I missed the Jets game because I'm now living in Florida.

The offensive line were definitely up against it. From what I've seen of this new offense, I don't like it. The Giants don't have the personnel. I don't know why these young coordinators always over complicate their schemes when they get their first shot. We saw Sean Payton do that when he was with the Giants too. Hopefully they will grow into it and have a strong second half. The first half of the season looks like it will be painful.<br /><br />You've spoiled us. I enjoy your NFL posts almost as much as your stories and I do miss them when you are busy.

My first game I went to was the infamous 1980 Thanksgiving game against the Bears. <br /><br />We left with 10 minutes to go, the Lions up by a comfortable margin. As we walked to the car (of course Dad parked a couple miles away to save on parking) we heard on others radios that the Bears scored again, and again, and tied the game to send it into overtime. Of course the Bears returned the overtime kickoff for a touchdown to win. This is the how we used to roll in Detroit. <br /><br />In spite of that introduction, I've always remained a fan. Throughout the bad years, and the occasional good year, the Lions have been my team. In '98, the wife and I moved to Phoenix. We had no trouble embracing the Cardinals, though we keep the Lions closest to our hearts still. Monday night was like getting a royal flush. Have our boys, both teams, finally turned it around? I've been fooled to many times to get my hopes up, but it was a very good night. <br /><br />The wife and I have some esoteric reasons to root for other teams. We hate Green Bay and Dallas because. One team we'd root for is the Giants, more specifically Eli. No matter how many Super Bowls he wins, it seems he's doomed to live in the shadow of his big brother, and we love an underdog. We are happy our Lions won so resoundingly, and wish nothing but the best for your G-men. <br /><br />But win or lose (and probably the latter of history is anything to go by) go Lions, go Cardinals, and go Eli!
