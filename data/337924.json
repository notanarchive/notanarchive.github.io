If Breaking Bad wins on Sunday, it will have also taken five seasons, and that show achieved greatness very early on (the \"Phoenix\" episode is absolutely extraordinary).  It's very difficult for non-traditional, non-prestige (though prestige is often mistaken for quality, sadly) shows to win the top award.  It takes a confluence of factors: story (what's shown in the six tapes each series submits), timing and buzz, critical response, industry response and perception....the actual quality of the show's nominated season is very far down the list and only a small part of the equation.<br /><br />As I said before, my hope with Game of Thrones is after this season and how the showrunners handle season four (hopefully it doesn't take over two full episodes to get the plot going and the Dany scenes don't always end the hour), I think it will become undeniable and sooo many people will be pushing for a win, like they did for Lord of the Rings at the Oscars.  But who knows?  These awards are damn near unpredictable, and while they are important, in the long run when you see shows like The Wire and Seinfeld go unrecognized or barely recognized, well...LOL!!  My hope is the creative team will finally get their due; people don't realize how difficult the act of adaptation is and the scope of the accomplishment you guys are pulling off.  It's unprecedented, on a scale never before seen on television, with a monster cast and locations all over the world.
