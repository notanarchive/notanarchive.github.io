{"itemid":1739,"subject":"Oh, Well","event":"Life is meaningless and full of pain.\r\n\r\nThe Jets have never beaten the Philadelphia Eagles.  Never.  \r\n\r\nA record they kept intact today.  \r\n\r\nThat 2-0 record was exciting, and I still think Gang Green will have a good season, maybe even make the playoffs.  But this morning was a tough one.  Especially the way it ended, on a stupid penalty just when the Jets were about the get the ball back.  It still would have been very unlikely that they could have tied the score, but I would at least liked to have seen them get to try the Hail Mary.\r\n\r\nsigh\r\n\r\nThe penalty that ended things wasn't even the worst play of the game.  That distinction goes to the \"lateral\" that Brandon Marshall tried after catching a first down pass.  \r\n\r\nToo many turnovers.  I will give to the Jets for the way they fought back in the second half.  For a little while I thought they might pull off a miracle comeback.  The first half, though... the D played tough throughout, but the O was horrible for the whole first half.  Three and out, three and out, three and out, three and out.  The running game was going nowhere, and while Fitz was completing a lot of passes, they were all to receivers behind the line of scrimmage, who would then immediately be tackled for no game.  VERY conservative play-calling.  In the second half, the Jets finally began to throw down the field, which led to some INTs but also a TD and some first downs.  I know the deep ball is not Fitz's strong point, but even so, throwing for a loss gets you nowhere.\r\n\r\nNext up for the Jets: the Dolphins, in London.  That one should tell us whether Gang Green is for real or not.","ditemid":445277,"eventtime":"2015-09-27 17:23:00","props":{"current_mood":"annoyed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":3,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1443664455,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Oh, Well http://goo.gl/NZZWbe","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.74356527824405]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1443396347}","revtime":1443722625},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-09-27 23:22:47","anum":93,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html","event_timestamp":1443374580,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125448500/76862375","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22712925#t22712925","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22712925#t22712925","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22712925#t22712925","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3322445","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1053392221360015/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22712925,"talkid":88722,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22712925#t22712925","upictitle":"Darwin Ol Franch Capitanio: pic#125448500","article":"<a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%23FlyEaglesFly\">#FlyEaglesFly</a>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"September 27 2015, 23:27:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1053392221360015/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Darwin Ol Franch Capitanio","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3322445","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76862375&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Darwin Ol Franch Capitanio","ctime_ts":1443396430,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125431637/76834126","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22713181#t22713181","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22713181#t22713181","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22713181#t22713181","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3314266","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10206481207662502/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22713181,"talkid":88723,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/445277.html?thread=22713181#t22713181","upictitle":"Keifer McKenna: pic#125431637","article":"I'm a Cards fan so I'm rooting for the Jets to do great things this season.

In addition, the way the Eagles clogged his passing lanes and knocked his fastballs down will be the model for every defense he faces going forward. He also made a lot of bad decisions, throwing to the check down guy, not the open guy farther downfield, or throwing into double coverage long, but he didn't do this the first game so maybe he was just off.<br /><br />What makes things worse is how many drops the Jets had. At least six. And no running game, at least not without Ivory. Ugh. I'm not as optimistic as you, George. Even with all the turnovers the first two games, they weren't dominating otherwise. There should be a stat called Turnover Adjusted Score so you can see how teams matched up minus the small miracle of a turnover.<br /><br />As for the Dolphins, the Jets never do well on the West Coast.
