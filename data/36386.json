{"itemid":142,"subject":"SubPress Shipping Limited Editions","event":"Subterranean Press is now shipping its deluxe limited editions of both FEVRE DREAM and HUNTER'S RUN, for those who love fine books.  These are gorgeous editions, and extensively illustrated.  Justin Sweet did the art of FEVRE DREAM, Bob Eggleton on HUNTER'S RUN.  Yum yum.\r\n\r\nWe will be running a more extensive story about this on my website news page, but I wanted to drop a quick mention here in case any of you want to hop over to Subterranean and snag a copy before they're all gone.  Bill Schafer tells me that only 75 copies remain unsold of the FEVRE DREAM print run, so if you want one, don't hesitate too long.\r\n\r\n(I love illustrated books.  All books should be illustrated).\r\n\r\nThe Subpress site is at http://www.subterraneanpress.com/","ditemid":36386,"eventtime":"2008-02-17 19:51:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":134,"opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":15,"verticals_list":"culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-02-18 02:57:08","anum":34,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/36386.html","event_timestamp":1203277860,"reply_count":0}
