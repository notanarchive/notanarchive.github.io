Digging through mail and catching up on football.\r\n\r\nToday I watched the Jets loss to the Ravens (pathetic offense, and though the D looked great in spots, they could not seem to get off the field on third down) and the Jets win over the Patriots (terrific).  Was that really that same team?  Sanchez looked wretched against Baltimore and great against New England.  And Tomlinson appears to have some legs left after all.\r\n\r\nNext up in the Manning Bowl.
