{"itemid":422,"subject":"HBO Casting Continues","event":"Casting on the HBO pilot of A GAME OF THRONES continues, but there's not much I can say about it, except in generalities.  Another of the supporting roles has been filled, I am told, and offers have been made on several more.  Now we're waiting to see if those deals will close, which of course depends on things like schedule, terms, money, and such.  If all the pieces fall into place, we'll have some exciting and talented additions to the cast.\r\n\r\nNo, I have no idea when HBO will make their next cast announcement.\r\n\r\nTwo major roles and some small ones remain unfilled as I write.\r\n\r\nLooks like I will be flying over to Ireland to watch some of the filming.  Still trying to figure out the dates.  Since I will be over there anyway, it seems like a good opportunity to meet some of my Irish fans, so I will likely be doing a couple of signings while I'm there.  One in Belfast, almost certainly, and maybe a second in Dublin.  We'll see what arrangements can be made.  Details will here and on my Appearances page, once I know 'em.","ditemid":108228,"eventtime":"2009-09-17 14:40:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":196,"taglist":"a game of thrones, hbo","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1253604361,"personifi_tags":"18:16,8:5,33:16,1:5,32:16,3:33,25:22,19:5,4:16,26:22,20:33,9:5,nterms:yes","verticals_list":"culture"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-09-17 20:49:53","anum":196,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/108228.html","event_timestamp":1253198400,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/89624859/14327049","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/108228.html?replyto=7373764","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/108228.html?thread=7373764#t7373764","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/108228.html?thread=7373764#t7373764","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/108228.html?thread=7373764#t7373764","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"a_r_williams","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://a-r-williams.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7373764,"talkid":28803,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/108228.html?thread=7373764#t7373764","upictitle":"a_r_williams: initials","article":"Awesome! <br /><br />Sounds like everything is coming together well.
