If you preordered, you should have yours as well.\r\n\r\nAnd if not, well, there's still time to arm yourself for the invasion of the Others and/or the zombie apocolypse, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nOrder from Valyrian Steel at http://www.valyriansteel.com/shop/swords/ice-sword-of-eddard-stark/prod_9.html\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h66xe/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h66xe/s640x480\" width=\"134\" height=\"480\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n(I should note, for those who came in late, that the Valyrian Steel replica is derived from the blade in the books, and is NOT modeled on the version seen in the HBO television show.  HBO preferred to make its own versions).\r\n\r\nReplicas of Longclaw and Needle remain available as well, while the supply lasts.","ditemid":231894,"eventtime":"2011-08-06 19:21:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"song of ice and fire, valyrian steel","current_moodid":99,"commentalter":1312907175,"give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-08-07 01:22:26","anum":214,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html","event_timestamp":1312658460,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?replyto=14435030","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14435030#t14435030","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14435030#t14435030","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14435030#t14435030","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jakk55","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jakk55.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14435030,"talkid":56386,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14435030#t14435030","article":"On a semi-related note, is there any chance we will see the various swords that are made out of valyrian steel in the show actually look like it? i.e. Damascus steel or faux-Damascus steel?","upictitle":"Jak: pic#0","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"5 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"August 7 2011, 05:09:50 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jakk55.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jakk55","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jakk55","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jakk55.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jakk55","ctime_ts":1312693790,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93350540/16637185","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?replyto=14440662","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14440662#t14440662","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14440662#t14440662","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14440662#t14440662","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jarathen","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jarathen.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14440662,"talkid":56408,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/231894.html?thread=14440662#t14440662","above":14435030,"upictitle":"jarathen: pic#93350540","article":"Just curious as to how a sword, even Ice (my favorite of them all), might protect me from the others.<br /><br />Also, the company that makes these swords did make a Damascus Longclaw, but I believe it sold out (they had 10 left as of April 25th).<br /><br />Next up is Robert's Warhammer.
