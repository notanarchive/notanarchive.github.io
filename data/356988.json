{"itemid":1394,"subject":"The Jokers Are Back","event":"<p>September 15, 1946 was the first Wild Cards Day, the day that Jetboy met Dr. Tod in the skies over Manhattan, and the wild card virus was released onto an unsuspecting world.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1986 was the 40th anniversary of that fateful day, and a pretty eventful 24 hours in its own right.&nbsp; The triumphs and tragedies of that day were chronicled in JOKERS WILD, the third volume of the Wild Cards series... and the first of our &quot;full mosaics.&quot;&nbsp; Back in 1986, when we wrote the book, we were experimenting with a form that no one had ever attempted in SF and fantasy before.&nbsp; Seven writers, seven characters, seven stories... all woven together into a fully collaborative novel, wherein the whole (we hoped) was more than the sum of its parts.</p><p>And let me you, editing this one was a bitch and a half.&nbsp; But well worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My writers complained a lot, as did I, but the readers love the result... and so did we, after a bit of time to reflect.&nbsp; So the Wild Cards series has continued to feature fully-interwoven mosaic novels ever since, albeit usually only once every three books or so, since the process of hammering these out is exhausting for all concerned.\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2014 is the day that JOKERS WILD, first of the full mosaics, was reissued by Tor books in trade paperback.&nbsp; It&#39;s been out of print and unavailable for longer than I care to think about, but now once more it is available at your local bookstore, or from your favorite online bookseller.&nbsp; Never looked better either, dressed up as it is in a spectacular new cover from Michael Komarck.</p><p><a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/188200/188200_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"JokersWild_newcompsm\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/188200/188200_300.jpg\" title=\"JokersWild_newcompsm\" width=\"198\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe featured writers (and their characters) this time around are yours truly (Hiram Worchester), Lewis Shiner (Fortunato), John Jos.

Snodgrass (Roulette), and Walton Simons (Demise).\r\n\r\n(I should mention: some Wild Cards books are good entry points to the series, but this is not one of them.&nbsp; JOKERS WILD is the culmination of our first triad, so you probably read WILD CARDS and ACES HIGH before tackling this one).</p>","ditemid":356988,"eventtime":"2014-02-11 23:01:00","props":{"current_mood":"nostalgic","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"tor, wild cards","current_moodid":60,"commentalter":1392524246,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1392749668},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-02-14 06:01:20","anum":124,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html","event_timestamp":1392159660,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124121725/11365918","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18718844#t18718844","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18718844#t18718844","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18718844#t18718844","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"harvey_rrit","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://harvey-rrit.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18718844,"talkid":73120,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18718844#t18718844","upictitle":"harvey_rrit: watership up","article":"Odd little queries:<br /><br />Have jokers ever hit upon the idea of calling uninfected people \"blanks\"?<br /><br />Has a rich person ever gotten pissed off at Croyd Crenson, found out what all-news station he listens to while he sleeps, bought it, changed the format to Classical, and played three weeks of Wagner so Croyd wakes up looking like Elmer Fudd?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"February 14 2014, 06:10:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://harvey-rrit.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"harvey_rrit","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"harvey_rrit","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://harvey-rrit.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"harvey_rrit","ctime_ts":1392358228,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91817750/413999","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18719100#t18719100","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18719100#t18719100","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18719100#t18719100","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"andrewducker","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://andrewducker.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18719100,"talkid":73121,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/356988.html?thread=18719100#t18719100","upictitle":"Andrew Ducker: Illuminati","article":"Wild Cards was my first exposure to you (The edition with the Brian Bolland covers).
