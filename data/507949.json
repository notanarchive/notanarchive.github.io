{"itemid":1984,"subject":"Six in a Row","event":"The Giants got their sixth win in a row yesterday, which is great.  Their longest win streak in years.  Of course, it was against the hapless Cleveland Browns, who are racing toward an 0 -16 season and the first overall pick in next year's draft.  I'm informed that it still counts.\r\n\r\nOdell Beckham had an amazing afternoon, catching two TDs and returning a kick for a third... though the last was called back on a penalty, pfui.  And JPP had a monster game on the defensive side of the ball, the best he's had since blowing off half his hand in a Fourth of July fireworks accident.  Big Blue's D seems to be getting better every game, and JPP is a big part of that.  Victor Cruz had a nice catch as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other, the win was not nearly as convincing as it should have been, considering the quality of the opposition, and there was plenty to be concerned about as well.   The Giants still have no running game to speak of, and the O-line is suspect.  They don't run block well, they don't give Eli enough time, and Eric Flowers commits too many holding penalties.\r\n\r\nSo while I am pleased, I am still far from convinced that the G-Men are juggernauts.  The Giants are now 8-3 and well positioned for a playoff run, but the real test for them lies ahead.  The easy part of their schedule ended in Cleveland.  Their last five games are all tough ones.  The acid test will come in their rematch with the Cowboys, who they beat in the season opener.  Dallas has not lost since.   Rematches with the Redskins and Eagles also await them, along with games against the Steelers and Lions.  Every one of those teams is formidable, and Eli and Company will need to be playing at the top of their form to beat any of them.  I just hope the Giants have saved their best for last.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets... sigh... well, they lost again.   To the Patriots.  What else is new?   \r\n\r\nTo be fair, Gang Green played a pretty good game.  If they had played that well in some of their earlier games, they might not be 3 - 8.  But they didn't, and they are.  Fitz had a good game, except right at the end when it really counted.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, I just don't see the sense of starting Fitz.  He's not going to be with the team next season, and even if he does \"give them the best chance to win,\" winning a few more games this season is not going to make any difference.  The Jets need to look to the future and start thinking about next season, and the season after.  They need to see what they have in Bryce Petty.   Yes, he's young, he's raw, he will make mistakes... but he won't get better sitting on the bench.   With rookie QBs like Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott tearing up the league, there's no good reason for not playing Petty, who has been in the league a season longer than either.  And if he's NOT the answer, well, better to know that sooner rather than later...","ditemid":507949,"eventtime":"2016-11-28 12:51:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Nov 28 19:51:15 2016]R [Mon Nov 28 19:51:16 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/803325403871879168 ","current_moodid":43,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1480443291,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/803325403871879168","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":3,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.714959945602501]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1480362893}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1984?v=1480444500","revtime":1480444496},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-28 19:51:13","anum":45,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507949.html","event_timestamp":1480337460,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121411156/65344279","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507949.html?thread=25321261#t25321261","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507949.html?thread=25321261#t25321261","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507949.html?thread=25321261#t25321261","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2058420","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25321261,"talkid":98911,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/507949.html?thread=25321261#t25321261","upictitle":"GeekFurious: pic#121411156","article":"I am going to try to stay positive after that game because they did win and looked alright... for... half... of it.
