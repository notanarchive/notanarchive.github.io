{"itemid":1975,"subject":"This, That, and t'Other Thing","event":"Another football Sunday has come and gone, with mixed results for yours truly.  \r\n\r\nThe Giants won, hanging on by the skin of their teeth to defeat the Iggles of Brotherly Luv.  Gifted with an early 14-0 lead by two Carson Wentz INTs, they still almost managed to blow it.  Eli threw his own INT just when it looked as if Big Blue was about to put the game away, but fortunately the defense saved him.  Biggest worry coming out of the game was an injury to Victor Cruz, which I hated to see.  He's one of my favorite players.  I hope he's back next week.\r\n\r\nThe Jets, meanwhile, managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.   After trailing for most of the game, they seemed poised to take the lead in the fourth quarter, only to have Fitz throw a devastating pick in the end zone.  Yet somehow they managed to get the ball back, and this time Fitz redeemed himself, tossing the go-ahead touchdown.  But the joy did not last for long.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Dolphins ran the ball all the way back for a TD, and that was that.  Gang Green now has as many losses as they did all last year.  The season is effectively over.  Bryce Petty looked pretty good in the short stretch they had him in after Fitz got clocked.  I hope we get to see more of him in the game to come.  Much as I like Fitz, we have to start thinking about the future.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts...\r\n\r\nThe election still has me in a state of high anxiety.  I am not sleeping well, and I think I check 538 about three dozen times a day, hoping for some good news.  Tuesday cannot come fast enough for me.  I think I speak for a lot of Americans when I say that I desperately want this thing to be over.  It has been SO ugly.  Come Tuesday night, I will either be relieved or suicidal.  I think I speak for a lot of Americans about that as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and speaking of that: the Trump PACs have rolled out two new television ads in New Mexico this weekend.  Both attack ads, natch.  One is a cartoon with animated Bill and Hillary characters rolling up to the White House unpacking boxes of scandals.  The other features an actress badly made up to be Hillary, in wig and pants suit, destroying phones and hard drives with hammers, drills, chain saws, and the like.  Both ads are stupid and offensive, and both confirm and underline the main point I made in my \"Simple Observation\" post.  Hillary's ads feature real footage of the real Donald J. Trump saying the things he really said.  These Trumps ads, on the other hand, have to resort to cartoons and over-the-top impersonators because <i><b>they can't actually find any real footage </b></i>of Hillary saying or doing anything reprehensible, comparable to the stuff Trump has said.\r\n\r\nI cannot possible imagine that any actual voters will be swayed by this stuff.  \"Hell, damn, I'm going to vote for Trump, did you see what Cartoon Hillary was doing?\"  But what the hell.  Even Honest Abe admitted that you could fool some of the people all of the time...\r\n\r\nI'm still excited about Emily St. John Mandel coming to the Jean Cocteau tomorrow.  If you're in the neighborhood, come join us.\r\n\r\nThe crowds at Meow Wolf of late have been astounding.  Since we first opened in late March, more than 300,000 people have visited the House of Eternal Return.  It's become one of Santa Fe's premiere attractions, and I am so pleased to have played my small part in creating it.\r\n\r\nOh, and last night Parris and I went to see DOCTOR STRANGE at the Violet Crown (in part to escape the crowds seeing TRUMPLAND at the JCC).   'twas fun.   As many of you know, I'm a Marvel fanboy from way back, and Doctor Strange was probably my favorite single character... well, him or Spider-Man, both drawn by Steve Ditko, whose art I loved.  (I say single character because I always loved the group books as well, the FF and Avengers and X-Men).  How much did I love Doctor Strange?  Well, let me just say, one of the characters I wrote for the comic book fanzines of the 60s was called Doctor Weird, so... \r\n\r\nThe movie is NOT the best Marvel superhero movie, as I was hoping it would be... it's more middle of the pack, I'd say... but it looked great, did justice to the character, and had some scenes that were downright Ditko-esque.  Of course, they had the obligatory Stan Lee cameo.  Now, if they had managed to include a <i><b>Steve Ditko</b></i> cameo, that would really have been something.   (Yes, I know, I know).  I do hope that Ditko saw at least a little money out of this.  He was a genius in his own way, and Doc would never have been half as interesting without Ditko's unique and idiosyncratic vision.","ditemid":505641,"eventtime":"2016-11-06 18:10:00","props":{"current_mood":"variable","current_location":"Slough of Despond","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, popular culture, superheroes, movies, nfl, politics, comic books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Nov  7 01:10:14 2016]R [Mon Nov  7 01:10:15 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/795433147181563904 ","homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1478584704,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/795433147181563904","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.702625798243248]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1478481035}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1975?v=1478584737","revtime":1478584734},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-07 01:10:14","anum":41,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html","event_timestamp":1478455800,"reply_count":85,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125136130/76214878","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25237033#t25237033","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25237033#t25237033","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25237033#t25237033","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3192148","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10155611067165577/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25237033,"talkid":98582,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25237033#t25237033","upictitle":"Maximilian Rubell: pic#125136130","article":"Moment of truth!!!

Although it's obvious one of the two could do more harm than good. Two fringe candidates (Trump and Sanders) from opposite parties did well this cycle b/c of secular forces which have been at play for decades and which will continue for decades. Globalization and the modern financial system have ensured losses of jobs in developed economies while keeping inflation low (for goods, not services). The problem is that net worth trends in the US (as published every three years by the Fed) show a stagnation in wealth for the middle class in the last decade or longer. The top 25% (called the \"mass affluent\" by some) have benefited from being owners - of stocks, real estate, etc while the middle bought into false dreams and hopes, using credit to fool themselves into thinking they were wealthier than they really were. This will not change regardless of the outcome. At the heart of this election is a financial crisis which has been eroding wealth and dignity of a significant portion of the population. Some call this a \"frog in a pot\" problem. There is tremendous irony in hiring a failed businessman to attempt to remedy a problem caused by many smart and successful businessmen.

Mohan: pic#0","article":" I am posting this on your blog because I cant send a private message to you on live journal. So dont let this message appear on your blog. I will post it. You can just read it and prevent it from appearing through moderation.<br /><br />I just found these two lines<br />“Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.”<br />Why is ned saying father to queens rather than father to \"a queen\". Like that makes more sense does it not? He is making sansa a queen, so how is queens coming in it?<br /><br />Another line which struck me as odd is this one<br />“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.”<br /><br />Like there is only one king,right? And that is getting married to Sansa? So is like Ned expecting Joffrey to get assasinated? I guess this is an editing mistake to. Should it not be a high lord?<br />If these are editing mistakes, please do make the changes.<br /><br />If they are something else (like foreshadowing), then dont spoil me by letting me know. I can keep secrets but it is always wise to \"trust no one\". <br /><br /><br />That said, I would be really happy if it is foreshadowing lol. It fits so well with the title song of ice and fire. Jon as revealed by the show is the son of Rhaegar(Fire) and Lyanna(Ice). So he is ice and fire. . If he marries Dany(fire) then he must marry Sansa or Arya(Ice) for balance sake. Arya seems to be among the few characters who genuinely cares for the smallfolk and there is irony in someone like her ending up as queen when it is something she least expects and thinks is for Sansa.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 7 2016, 05:42:25 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Query regarding 2 editing mistakes in A Game of Thrones book","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sidsnow.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sidsnow","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sidsnow","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sidsnow.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sidsnow","ctime_ts":1478497345,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25245737#t25245737","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25245737#t25245737","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25245737#t25245737","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25245737#t25245737","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"seanbhickey","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://seanbhickey.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25245737,"talkid":98616,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25245737#t25245737","upictitle":"seanbhickey: pic#0","article":"<p dir=\"ltr\">As much as politics is dominating opinions at the moment, there is a more pressing issue here: what are your top 5 favourite Marvel movies?</p>","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 7 2016, 07:21:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://seanbhickey.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"seanbhickey","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"seanbhickey","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://seanbhickey.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"seanbhickey","ctime_ts":1478503293,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25251881#t25251881","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25251881#t25251881","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25251881#t25251881","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25251881#t25251881","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25251881,"talkid":98640,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25251881#t25251881","above":25245737,"upictitle":"George R.R.

This would put a stop to the black market trade of gangs, drugs, money and guns which strengthens the cartels and MS13 and is destructive to everyone else.<br /><br />•Reforming immigration. Trump wants to keep criminals out, while streamlining legal immigration so that immigrants who want to contribute don't get stuck in long waiting periods and red tape.<br /><br />•Taking the fight to ISIL. ISIL is a terrorist army destabilizing a whole region and radicalizing people around the world, while committing every sort of war crime. We should deal with them decisively.<br /><br />•Repealing Common Core. This is a great idea, as Common Core is a terrible experiment in education for numerous reasons.<br /><br />•Reforming Obamacare for lower cost and higher quality, and allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines.<br /><br />•Reforming and streamlining the tax system.

Nothing has come of it because out side of conspiracy web sites no evidence of wrong doing is forthcoming (and she turned over her tax returns...)<br /><br />Pence is a zealot for the relgious right.<br /><br />Everyone wants a more secure border easier said then done (a wall won't work).  Currently we have no net immagration (legal or illegal from Mexico) nor are gangs or drugs problems caused just by Mexico.  As to guns they are smuggled FROM the US TO Mexico to get around their guns laws - not vice versa.<br /><br />The Republican Congress blocks all immigration reform (W. Bush tried).  Everyone wants to keep the criminals out - thats a goal not a policy - and progressives have tried to stream line legal immigration for years - blocked by congress.<br /><br />ISIL is being beaten on the battlefield by Iraq with US aid (about 5K troops).  This is the proper strategy not sending masses of US troops (resented by locals and undermining the necessary self reliance of local forces).  They are being dealt with - it takes time and good strategy - not polictical hot air to beat them.<br /><br />Common Core was started by the States (not Feds) to improve education standards.  In my home state, Georgia, we spend money on education only wehen politicians are forced to by needing to meet standards.  Lowering standards means my kids in public schools get a lower standard of education.<br /><br />Trump wants to repeal ObamaCare not reform it (he has not actual replacement plan).  My nephew has a pre-exiting condition and get insurance only because of ObamaCare.  Everyone wants lower costs and better care - again your stating goals not means.  If Trump has better health care system let him and the Congress pass it first - before burning down ObamaCare.<br /><br />The tax system needs reform.  It benefits crony capaitalists (like Trump).  Trickle down has never worked.  Income inequality is our number one economic problem, Trump's solution will make this worse by reducing taxes on the rich now used for education and infrastructure - which helps those trying to move up. Repealing the Estate tax will help only the rich and increase the deficet.  Tax rates on the rich were much higher in the 50s a period of tremendous captial investment.<br /><br />Domestic security tends to mean annoying those you don't like.  Crimes has fallen steadily in the US for years.  Domestic terror is much less than in Europe and many other countries with authoritarian leaders.  What civil disorder?  Protesters?  No we don't need a US Putin.<br /><br />Mental health services take money.  Esp from the States.  But as they are often not run by progressives little is done.  How would mental health issues be addressed?  Lock them up?  Rehab programs?  Mental health facilties?  Paid for by...?  Taxes - which he plans to lower? <br /><br />Listing goals is not the same as stating methods to achieve them.  Let alone how to pay for all this and lower taxes.<br /><br />TomT","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 7 2016, 20:09:27 UTC","parent":25249065,"massactions":0,"subject":"Serious Reply","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://starkdad.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"starkdad","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"starkdad","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://starkdad.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"starkdad","ctime_ts":1478549367,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25258793#t25258793","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25258793#t25258793","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25258793#t25258793","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"xcalibur201","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://xcalibur201.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25258793,"talkid":98667,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25258793#t25258793","above":25255209,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","parent":25255209,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Serious Reply","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://xcalibur201.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"xcalibur201","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"xcalibur201","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://xcalibur201.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"xcalibur201","ctime_ts":1478568909,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25261353#t25261353","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25261353#t25261353","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25261353#t25261353","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25261353,"talkid":98677,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25261353#t25261353","above":25258793,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","parent":25258793,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Serious Reply","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1478583900,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25249321#t25249321","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25249321#t25249321","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25249321#t25249321","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"guessingo","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://guessingo.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25249321,"talkid":98630,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/505641.html?thread=25249321#t25249321","upictitle":"guessingo: pic#0","article":"Pro Football Focus had Pugh rated as the top Guard in the NFL.

A good draft class with a starter or two and some cog pieces and this team is not far away from competing in what will eventually become a winnable division... Once Tom Brady retires that is.

Two minutes. So much is on the line here and it seems like half the states have lost sight of what would really happen if Trump wins. I don't like Hillary, but I'd rather take email scandal over the piles of things that Trump has done and is going to court for right after the election. I don't want my daughter to grow up as a second class citizen just because she is female (that's where this seems to go, I mean Trump Jr basically said he would like to repeal the 19th amendment that allows women to vote!) It seems they are pushing so hard and so blindly that I'm sure years from now some reporter will ask Mr Trump about his running for president and he will look directly to the reporter and say<br />\"I never did that.\"<br /><br />On another note...<br />For those who early voted shouldn't there be a way to block these ads?<br /><br />Oh, I can't wait to see Dr Strange. Hoping to catch it over the next weekend, glad to hear it was great.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 months ago","ctime":"November 7 2016, 16:12:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Attack Ads","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://underhermask.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"underhermask","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"underhermask","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://underhermask.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"underhermask","ctime_ts":1478535151,"tracked":0}]}
