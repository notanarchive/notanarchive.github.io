{"itemid":1543,"subject":"Rumors and Fabrications","event":"It seems I need to clarify once more.\r\n\r\nI am NOT on Twitter.&nbsp; I am NOT on Facebook.&nbsp; The only place I post myself, in my own words, is here on Live Journal.\r\n\r\nI do have an official Twitter account, and an official Facebook account.&nbsp; I established these in self-defense, because there were fake accounts out there, where people pretending to be me were making various spurious pronouncements... pronouncements that would then get picked up all over the internet and repeated as if they were gospel.\r\n\r\nThe official Twitter and Facebook accounts are maintained for me by my minions and my publishers.&nbsp; I don&#39;t post there myself.&nbsp; I don&#39;t even read them or check comments.&nbsp; I have other stuff to do.&nbsp; LOTS of other stuff.\r\n\r\nAnyway, a few weeks ago, Raya came to me and said the folks at Random House wanted to do a special promotion on Twitter, a &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; with a Westerosi twist.&nbsp; Did they have the green light?&nbsp; It sounded fun, and funny, so I said sure, and thought no more of it.&nbsp; It was just a little Christmas celebration.\r\n\r\nBut then, somehow, from somewhere, the rumor arose that the &quot;12 Days&quot; were actually a countdown... not to Xmas, but to the publication of THE WINDS OF WINTER, or the announcement of its completion and/ or pub date.\r\n\r\nSorry.&nbsp; Not true.&nbsp; Look, I&#39;ve said before, and I will say again, I don&#39;t play games with news about the books.&nbsp; I know how many people are waiting, how long they have been waiting, how anxious they are.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am still working on WINDS.&nbsp; When it&#39;s done, I will announce it here.&nbsp; There won&#39;t be any clues to decipher, any codes or hidden meanings, the announcement will be straightforward and to the point.&nbsp; I won&#39;t time it to coincide with Xmas or Valentine&#39;s Day or Lincoln&#39;s Birthday, the book will not rise from the dead with Jesus on Easter Sunday.&nbsp; When it is done, I will say that&#39;s it is done, on whatever day I happen to finish.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how I can make it any clearer.\r\n\r\nAnd while I am debunking rumors, let me also say that this story about me being inspired to finsh WINDS by STAR WARS is also utter bullshit, and I have NO idea where that one came from.&nbsp; (I liked the first two STAR WARS movies, the third not so much, the prequels not at all, and the trailer for the new one had no impact on me one way or the other, and let&#39;s face it, even the best of &#39;em is no FORBIDDEN PLANET.&nbsp; Robby is my robot ideal, not C3PO or R2D2).&nbsp; Made up out of whole cloth, so far as I know.\r\n\r\nIt really stuns me how widely the STAR WARS thing has been disseminated.&nbsp; Truly, internet journalism is an oxymoron.\r\n\r\nAs Mark Twain once said, &quot;A lie can travel halfway around the world while truth is putting on its shoes.&quot;","ditemid":395189,"eventtime":"2014-12-09 16:52:00","props":{"current_mood":"frustrated","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"internet, the winds of winter","current_moodid":47,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1418877477,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Rumors and Fabrications http://j.mp/12JBo3S","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"angry","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.641823563482458]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1418996381}","revtime":1418877529},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-12-13 23:51:23","anum":181,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html","event_timestamp":1418143920,"reply_count":85,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124353084/73550358","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19842741#t19842741","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19842741#t19842741","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19842741#t19842741","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2920879","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RTerlep","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19842741,"talkid":77510,"etime_ts":"1418515218","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19842741#t19842741","upictitle":"Rachel Terlep: pic#124353084","article":"\"the book will not rise from the dead with Jesus on Easter Sunday.\"<br /><br />I can't help but think there's another resurrection you could have used here, but there's no use in getting -hung- up on it.

People act as if you're willfully misleading us about the progress you're making, and that it's just going to magically come out unexpectedly. These people are deluded, unfortunately. As an artist, it takes time to create your art that which you consider up to your own standards. If readers cannot be patient, and simply wait for what we know will be your next piece of awe-inspiring art, then they do not truly appreciate art, and what it takes to create something of the magnitude of your novels. Was The World of Ice and Fire not enough for now(I think it's simply amazing, by the way. Great job by everyone on that)? I'm sure that creation, and subsequent release, was exhausting enough without having fans pester your about The Winds of Winter. If these fans want the novel to come out, perhaps they should just leave you the hell alone, and let you work your magic, so to speak. A frustrated artist is rarely a productive artist...especially when your medium is fictional literature. <br /><br />I know people are chomping at the bit to know what happens next in the storyline(s); this is perfectly understandable. But jumping to conclusions, and making wholly unfounded assumptions that emotionally affect the author is flat-out ridiculous. The fans who truly appreciate the process, as well as the final work, will wait as long as necessary. As much as I would love to have The Winds of Winter in my lap at this moment, I sure as hell am not going to pester anyone about it, or complain. Especially not to the point where it practically ruins a fun Holiday-themed promotion we all could have enjoyed without any frustrations. People must think being a world-class, world-famous author consists on sitting on your ass and pumping out pages in order to get a book out as fast as possible. Even if you wanted to do that(which no sane writer would want to do), do people not understand you have obligations? Successful people who enjoy what they do are usually pretty damn busy. At least some of us understand this. <br /><br />I hope everyone has a safe Holiday Season and a wonderful New Year! Now I'm going to go continue to re-read all the amazing work that has been released. That's good enough for me until The Winds of Winter is ready to be shared with the world; whenever that may be. <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 14 2014, 00:34:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I, for one, understand your frustration.","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://inveniamviam.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"inveniamviam","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"inveniamviam","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://inveniamviam.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"inveniamviam","ctime_ts":1418517267,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124353218/73550688","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19847093#t19847093","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19847093#t19847093","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19847093#t19847093","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2920913","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/flynn.pollard","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19847093,"talkid":77527,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19847093#t19847093","upictitle":"Flynn Pollard: pic#124353218","article":"Seriously these books are the best I've ever read.

We know that you're a great writer, and a great storyteller, and you're going to tell a great story. <br /><br />-Firestone ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"December 14 2014, 01:28:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"No worries","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/andrew.firestone1","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Andrew Firestone","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2920892","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73550426&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"December 14 2014, 01:29:36 UTC","dname":"Andrew Firestone","ctime_ts":1418520498,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116338580/21331","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19848885#t19848885","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19848885#t19848885","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19848885#t19848885","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"livejournal","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://livejournal.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19848885,"talkid":77534,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/395189.html?thread=19848885#t19848885","upictitle":"LiveJournal: rating_bot","article":"Hello!
