{"itemid":576,"subject":"Cage Match Postscript","event":"The Suvudu Cage Match final is over.  Alas, Ser Jaime lost in the last hour when a sudden rush of votes for his opponent washed out what had been a razor-thin lead.\r\n\r\nCongratulations to Rand al'Thor and his legions of fans and admirers, to Brandon Sanderson, to Tor Books, and of course to the late Robert Jordan, aka Lord Jordayne of the Tor.\r\n\r\nFor Brandon Sanderson's amusing postscript to the finals, check out:\r\n\r\nhttp://mistborn.livejournal.com/147622.html\r\n\r\nThanks to the good folk at Suvudu for running this.  It was certainly a wild ride.  IMNSHO, some of the comments got a little overheated and rancorous toward the end, but for the most part it was a lot of fun.  I hope they take my suggestion and do the Mainstream Cage Match next.  I want to see how Little Dorrit does against Don Quixote.","ditemid":147461,"eventtime":"2010-04-12 13:20:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":148,"taglist":"general nonsense","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":40,"commentalter":1271721513,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"28:3,17:10,45:3,8:17,10:3,33:3,23:7,32:3,16:10,1:17,3:28,4:28,20:7,9:21,13:3,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-04-12 19:20:56","anum":5,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html","event_timestamp":1271078400,"reply_count":38,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/106375917/64438","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?replyto=9673989","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9673989#t9673989","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9673989#t9673989","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9673989#t9673989","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"gillan","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://gillan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9673989,"talkid":37789,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9673989#t9673989","upictitle":"The Knight in Shining Skull T-shirt: pic#106375917","article":"Yeah, comments were crazy at points.<br /><br />I am glad Jaime made it so far!

I needed some heavy firepower to stand even a chance against Rand, given his wide range of abilities.<br /><br />The ones I used were the Great and Powerful Turtle, Popinjay, Lohengrin, and Hoodoo Mama (who did not get to do anything, alas, but her power to raise and command the dead would have been very useful under different circumstances).  The first two are from the early Wild Cards books, the last two from the more recent \"next generation\" triad that began with INSIDE STRAIGHT.  I did limit myself to using only characters that I'd actually created, rather than WC characters created by others.  Elsewise I might have rung in Lew Shiner's character Fortunato, whose myriad powers included an ability to STOP TIME for everyone but himself... which would have made for a very short match.<br /><br />Melisandre was the sixth of Jaime's seven.  Her you should know from Ice & Fire.  The seventh character was really a reach: Sharra, the girl who goes between the worlds, from the first fantasy story I ever sold, \"The Lonely Songs of Laren Dorr,\" published way back in the 70s.  It was kind of cool to dust her off again after so many years.  Once upon a time I intended to write a whole series of stories about Sharra, but I never got around to it... and then, in the 1990s, I returned to the concept for my TV pilot, DOORWAYS, but with a much different take.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 13 2010, 02:05:40 UTC","parent":9691909,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: More Readers","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1271124340,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9697797#t9697797","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9697797#t9697797","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9697797#t9697797","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"scottgoblue314","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://scottgoblue314.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9697797,"talkid":37882,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9697797#t9697797","above":9692421,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","parent":9692421,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: More Readers","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://scottgoblue314.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"scottgoblue314","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"scottgoblue314","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://scottgoblue314.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"scottgoblue314","ctime_ts":1271133666,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9705989#t9705989","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9705989#t9705989","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9705989#t9705989","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aulus_poliutos","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aulus-poliutos.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9705989,"talkid":37914,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9705989#t9705989","above":9697797,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","parent":9697797,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: More Readers","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://aulus-poliutos.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"aulus_poliutos","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"aulus_poliutos","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://aulus-poliutos.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"aulus_poliutos","ctime_ts":1271172576,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/55465209/6471148","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?replyto=9699845","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9699845#t9699845","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9699845#t9699845","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9699845#t9699845","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"penelopesa","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://penelopesa.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9699845,"talkid":37890,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9699845#t9699845","upictitle":"Anomie and Ennui: Escape","article":"Thanks for all the amazing cage-match write-ups!<br /><br />Even though Jaime lost, I'd rather have a close amazing race and lose than have the guy I'm rooting for win in a blow out.

Before I go on to explain, note that all the news I have read about these cage matches comes from this not-blog; I haven't actually gone to the suvudu site (it's blocked from, er, where I'm most often online).  For what it's worth.  So all I know about this match that's relevant is what's been said here: that Jaime lost, despite the help of a bunch of Wild Cards superheroes.  <br /><br />My take on the final outcome:  Sure, there's the fact that al'Thor is a master swordsman AND has god-like powers, whereas Jaime's just an ordinary (if highly skilled... if a little crippled) master swordsman, but that's not the real reason I sort of expected this outcome.  The real reason is, well, Jaime's one of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire characters, and let's face it: dying at the worst possible moment in the most shocking ways that make you want to tear your hair out just when you were finally convinced they're actually decent folk and that they've somehow made their way to safety is just what these people DO.  Losing this one was therefore entirely in character, and certainly in keeping with the series in general.  I wouldn't have it any other way; no more than I'd ask George to rewrite a happy ending for the Red Wedding.  If Jaime had won this one and walked away from the whole thing unscathed, it'd probably keep me up nights, waiting for the other shoe to drop.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 13 2010, 18:07:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1271182027,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/47476795/5401545","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?replyto=9711109","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9711109#t9711109","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9711109#t9711109","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9711109#t9711109","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"xallanthia","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://xallanthia.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9711109,"talkid":37934,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/147461.html?thread=9711109#t9711109","upictitle":"xallanthia: ship","article":"Due to my deep and abiding love for many of the series represented, I chose my votes based on who did the best writeups... which means I didn't vote for Jamie against Temeraire, I admit, because Naomi Novik's American Idol contest had me screaming with laughter.
