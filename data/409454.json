{"itemid":1599,"subject":"Opening Tonight","event":"Opening tonight at the Jean Cocteau Cinema, we have KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN, an offbeat crime drama based on a true story and featuring the redoubtable Anthony Hopkins.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"547\"/>\r\n\r\nWe are also holding over the classic Cocteau BEAUTY AND THE BEAST... the film that helped to inspire the TV show that I wrote for in the 80s, and the name of my theatre as well.  Last chance to catch that one.  If you've never it on the big screen, you're missing something.  The film has been beautifully restored.","ditemid":409454,"eventtime":"2015-03-06 11:07:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, movies, movie theatre","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1425700048,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Opening Tonight http://j.mp/1Mcs08V","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.765585196928618]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1425665242}","revtime":1426123343},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-06 18:06:41","anum":110,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html","event_timestamp":1425640020,"reply_count":4,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123030036/69666572","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332142#t20332142","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332142#t20332142","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332142#t20332142","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2501806","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/JessDyba","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20332142,"talkid":79422,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332142#t20332142","upictitle":"Jess Dyba: pic#123030036","article":"Sorry to hijack this topic, but I was interested to find out your feeling on the JETS trading for Brandon Marshall.<br /><br />Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker, now if only they had someone to throw them the ball.....draft a QB time?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"March 6 2015, 18:48:24 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"JETS","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/JessDyba","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jess Dyba","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2501806","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=69666572&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jess Dyba","ctime_ts":1425667704,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332398#t20332398","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332398#t20332398","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332398#t20332398","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20332398,"talkid":79423,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/409454.html?thread=20332398#t20332398","above":20332142,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Unfortunately Santa Fe is a little out of my way, or I'd be happy to see the restoration. <br /><br />Somewhat disturbingly, I've just read that the story is about to be Disneyfied again, this time in live action form, with Emma Watson as the heroine, and a bloke from Downton Abbey as the hirsute suitor. In spite of Miss Watson's undoubted charms, I will give it a miss, particularly as nudity seems unlikely. I seem to recall she once said she'd only strip for Bertolucci, so I can only hope her people are locked in talks with his people.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"March 6 2015, 20:05:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Beauty and the Beast","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://andrew-mcguire.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"andrew_mcguire","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"andrew_mcguire","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://andrew-mcguire.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"andrew_mcguire","ctime_ts":1425672321,"tracked":0}]}
