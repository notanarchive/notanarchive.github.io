{"itemid":2085,"subject":"More Author Videos","event":"We've added two more videos from recent author events at the Jean Cocteau to the JCC website:\r\n\r\nCONNIE WILLIS, interviewed by Melinda M. Snodgrass\r\n\r\nJOHN NICHOLS, interviewed by Lorene Mills\r\n\r\nIf you weren't able to be with us in person, you can check them out at\r\n\r\nhttp://jeancocteaucinema.com/exclusive-video/\r\n\r\nConnie and I have known each other for decades, of course, and she's always a delight.  John Nichols, however, I've only met once or twice previously, and the last time was probably twenty years ago at an event up in Colorado organized by Ed Bryant.  Nichols is a fascinating man, however, and he had a lot to say.  Even if you don't know his work, you should find him interesting.\r\n\r\nThe video of my own talk with John Scalzi is not ready yet, but should be up soon.\r\n\r\nAutographed books by Connie Willis, Melinda Snodgrass, John Nichols, John Scalzi, and myself are all available from the JCC website, of course.   Along with lots more from other authors.\r\n\r\nA recent comment from a \"fan\" said, in rather strong words, that he was not interested in the Jean Cocteau or anything that went on there.  Fair enough.  No one said you had to be.  Maybe you should skip the posts with the JCC icon on top.\r\n\r\nThing is, though, that <i>Santa Fe</i> cares about the Jean Cocteau... I've had many people tell me that they love our little theatre... and more to the point, I care as well.   The Jean Cocteau doesn't bring me big wheelbarrows of money.  Far from it.  If we ever manage to get it into the black, I may die of shock.  It is, however, a source of joy... for our patrons, for our city, and certainly for myself.  And in the end, we all need some joy in our lives.","ditemid":533878,"eventtime":"2017-04-19 13:51:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, jean cocteau cinema, author events, signed books","current_moodid":15,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1493231608,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.645457897052351]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1492631517}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2085?v=1493140281","revtime":1493140281},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-04-19 19:51:29","anum":118,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533878.html","event_timestamp":1492609860,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121835354/66349588","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533878.html?thread=26023542#t26023542","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533878.html?thread=26023542#t26023542","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533878.html?thread=26023542#t26023542","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2171750","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/GypsyDRB","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":26023542,"talkid":101654,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/533878.html?thread=26023542#t26023542","upictitle":"GypsyDRB: pic#121835354","article":"Right on George!

I only wish I didn't live so far away in Albuquerque. I would never have thought I would have the chance to meet and get to know so many authors that I enjoy reading. And the Jean Cocteau has a totally different feel from many \"meet the author\" and signing venues. The difference is you, George. Your experience and long history in SFF brings a lot to any interview, and hearing about some authors' early interactions with you are so entertaining! I'm thinking right now about John Scalzi's story about being at a signing next to you when he was a brand new published author. I'll never look at omnibus editions the same way! The conversations on the stage can take totally unexpected turns, and I feel like the authors I have seen are more at ease in Santa Fe than elsewhere. This is one of the perks I never expected when I moved to New Mexico. <br />But I also enjoy the interesting films that you bring to the theater. Again, a big frustration is that I can't enjoy them more often. I'm glad that Your Name is being held over so I will get a chance to see it on a medium size :-) screen! I came to the premiere of Mad Max: Fury Road. I only wish I could see all the Max Headroom series as well as the \"lost\" episodes that you wrote, George! I was so disappointed when Max was not renewed!<br />To me, the Jean Cocteau just adds depth to who George is, aside from the guy who writes some incredibly complex, emotional, and immersive stories. I'm always glad to hear about what is happening there!

We moved to Santa Fe almost exactly around the time you reopened the Jean Cocteau. We 1000% appreciate you running this place at a loss since it's a huge asset to the Santa Fe community. My wife and I loved going to your recent back-to-back weekends of Hugo award winning authors of Connie Willis and John Scalzi. Anytime we have guests in town we try and take them to the Jean Cocteau (and now Meow Wolf which you helped make huge by being a great landlord). <br /><br />It's a shame we're such a small city. I feel like most of your events, especially the author events, would easily be sold out in bigger cities. Maybe you guys can somehow make more Albuquerqueans more aware of the Jean Cocteau's unique awesomeness or at least make them aware that it even exists. Most Santa Feans I know at least know about the Jean Cocteau by now at this point but most ABQeans I talk to haven't even heard of it. <br /><br />With Meow Wolf's huge attendance numbers, perhaps you should do a lot more cross-promotions with them. Like a discount promo gift card where you get an entry to one movie or event at the Jean Cocteau and one admittance to Meow Wolf both at slightly discounted rates? Considering you're just the land lord for Meow Wolf you might not have the power to actually do such cross promotions but if you can they'd certainly help raise the profile of the Jean Cocteau to more out-of-towners. <br /><br />Right now it almost feels like a local secret, though I really shouldn't be complaining too much about low attendance numbers since that means easier tickets for us Santa Feans.  <br /><br /><br /> ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 weeks ago","ctime":"April 24 2017, 20:01:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Haters are going to hate.","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/UTLonghorn1","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Sean Hall","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1785679","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=63422077&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Sean Hall","ctime_ts":1493064103,"tracked":0}]}
