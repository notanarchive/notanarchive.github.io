{"itemid":1683,"subject":"We're Number One... Again","event":"Much to my surprise, my editor Anne Groell sent me an email while I was over in Europe (Germany, Sweden, Aland) to let me know that the mass market paperback of A GAME OF THRONES had hit number one on the NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list for the week of July 5.\r\n\r\nThe July 5 list shows:\r\n\r\n<b>New York Times Bestseller List\r\nJuly 5th, 2015\r\n \r\nTrade Paperback Fiction\r\n11. A GAME OF THRONES\r\n \r\nMass Market Fiction\r\n1. A GAME OF THRONES\r\n10. A DANCE WITH DRAGONS\r\n11. A CLASH OF KINGS\r\n17. A STORM OF SWORDS\r\n \r\nAdvice, How-To and Miscellaneous\r\n13. THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE\r\n \r\nE-book Fiction\r\n19. A GAME OF THRONES: FIVE-BOOK SET \r\n \r\nCombined Fiction\r\n14. A GAME OF THRONES\r\n </b>\r\n \r\nAll great, of course, but I have to confess, that return to #1 especially tickles.\r\n\r\nPretty damn good for a book first published in 1996.\r\n\r\n(It is the return to the show to the airwaves that's responsible, of course, so thanks to HBO and David and Dan and Bryan and our amazing cast and directors... and also to Anne, and all the great folks at Bantam Spectra, who have kept all of the books in print and available for lo these long years.
