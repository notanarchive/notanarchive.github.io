{"itemid":1637,"subject":"Hatespeech","event":"Are there any limits to free speech?\r\n\r\nThat's a question I have been pondering a lot of late, as the storms of Puppygate swirl all around me.  My own politics are liberal... which means I lean left, but not way over to the fringe left.  Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom to dissent, all of that has always been central to my political attitudes.  The freedom of the artist to create should be absolute.  I have always been against censorship, silencing, McCarthyism.  (The McCarthy period, a particular fascination of mine, was one of the blackest eras in American history.  The Time of the Toad, Dalton Trumbo called it; Trumbo was one of its victims).  \r\n\r\n((It should be noted, since idiots always misunderstand this point, that freedom of speech does not mean you can say whatever you want wherever you want.  If you want to proclaim that you are the new messiah or call for ethnic cleansing of Martians or even promote your new book, I think you should be able to stand on a soapbox in the park, or start your own website, and do just that.  I don't think free speech requires me to let you into my living room to give your speech, or into my virtual living room here on the internet)).\r\n\r\nOf late, I have begun to fear that the Time of the Toad has returned.  Only this time, thanks to the internet, the Toad is much larger.  This Toad is Tsathoggua, for all you Lovecraft fans out there.  And this toad is so huge and monstrous and venomous, and seems to have so many friends and fans and worshippers, that it has begun to shake even my long-held fervent belief in the sanctity of free speech... and the basic decency of human beings.\r\n\r\nI am talking, of course, about the Toad of Hatespeech.\r\n\r\nI am not a gamer, and I have not closely followed GamerGate.  Nor do I care to get embroiled in it now.  I don't care who slept with whom, or whether some reviews were biased... but I do care that some of the participants, especially women, received death threats and rape threats from anonymous toads on the internet.  I have never met Zoe Quinn or Anita Sarkeesian or Brianna Wu, and I don't know that I would agree with them on the issues at the heart of GamerGate, but it does not matter.  Threats have no place in civilized discourse, and neither do slurs like \"cunt\" and \"slut\" and \"whore.\"  Oh, yes, I am aware that some say these women fabricated the threats against them.  Bullshit.  I believe they did indeed receive such threats... for the simple reason that friends of mine, women I DO know, and love, and respect, have received similar threatening and demeaning emails whenever they have dared to express an opinion online.  \r\n\r\nAnd now there's Puppygate, and I have been posting about that, and in the course of which I have had some exchanges with Larry Correia, the founder of Sad Puppies, and Brad Torgensen, who ran the SP3 slate.  And both of them tell similar tales: of anonymous phone calls, libel and slander, vicious emails, death threats... <b><i></i></b>death threats!<i><b></b></i>  All of these, presumably, coming from \"my side\" of fandom, those who oppose the Puppies.  Do I believe them?  I don't <b><i></i></b>want<i><b></b></i> to believe them.  I would rather cling to the belief that my side is better than that.  That's hard to do these days,  As strongly as I disagree with Torgensen and Correia about the Hugo Awards, and probably a hundred other issues, I have no reason to think them liars.  I think they are telling the truth, just as Quinn and Sarkeesian and Wu were.  On the internet, it seems, abuse trumps debate every time.\r\n\r\nDeath threats.  Really?  <b><i></i></b>Really???<i></i>  \r\n\r\nIt really makes me wonder.  Were there always so many toads out there, so many slimy squirming venomous cowards lurking in their parents' basements?  Or did the internet somehow just bring them into being overnight, these children of Tsathoggua?\r\n\r\nI really don't know, but it makes me despair.  Is this what we are as a country, as a people?  When we disagree, is it really necessary to spit and snap at each other, to throw around insults and obscenities, to make death threads, rape threats?  Can't we just debate the issues?\r\n\r\nI have lots of problems with this year's Hugo ballot, as I have made crystal clear in the posts below.  But there is one nomination that I wholeheartedly applaud... the only suggestion from my own \"recommended\" list (one novel, two movies, some TV shows, six artists, and Laura):\r\n\r\nLAURA J. MIXON made the shortlist for Best Fan Writer.  Here's why:\r\n\r\nhttp://laurajmixon.com/2014/11/a-report-on-damage-done-by-one-individual-under-several-names/\r\n      \r\nhttp://laurajmixon.com/2015/02/requires-hate-follow-up-three-months-later-are-we-past-the-winter-of-our-discontent/\r\n\r\nhttp://laurajmixon.com/\r\n\r\nI am not going to talk about Requires Hate here.  I do not have to.  Laura Mixon has said everything that needs saying.  I cannot overemphasize how much I admire her courage, her diligence, her compassion, her integrity.  She did something that needed doing, something no one else was willing to tackle for fear that they too might be targeted.  I will also say, as a one-time journalist with a j-school master's, that this is investigative journalism the way it ought to be practiced: thoroughly researched, well sourced, based on verified facts, everything checked and double-checked and backed up by first-hand testimony.  \r\n\r\nAnd here's the thing: Laura Mixon is a \"Social Justice Warrior\" if ever there was one.  Unlike me, she might even accept that label.  She cares about social justice.  She hates sexism, racism, misogyny.  She wants our field to be more inclusive.  She has fought her own battles, as an engineer writing hard SF, and being told that women could not write hard SF.  Laura is well to the left of me.  She's also a kinder, gentler, and more forgiving person than I am.  And yet she did this, devoted months to it, uncounted amounts of efforts... because someone had to, because lives and careers were being ruined, because people were being hurt.\r\n\r\nI hope she gets a Hugo.  For herself, and for all of Hate's victims.\r\n\r\nThere's something else that needs to be said here.  Requires Hate did not flourish all alone.  Had she been a lone voice crying in the wilderness, ignored and shunned, she could not possibly have done the damage that she did.  She had enablers.  Allies.  Others who shared her goals and values to a greater or lesser extent, and for that reason were willing to cheer her on, or at least turn a blind eye when she called for writers to be burned alive, or raped by dogs, or have acid thrown in their faces.  I am not going to name names here, though I could.  If any of you are reading this, you know who you are.  Some of you even called for Requires Hate to be nominated for a Hugo as Best Fan Writer... the very award Laura is now in contention for (irony is a bitch).  Instead of speaking up for the victims, you wanted to give an award to the person attacking them.  You should be ashamed, every one of you.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to Puppygate... and, at long last, to the Rabid Puppies.\r\n\r\nOnly Nixon could go to China.  If a liberal Democrat had done it, the Republicans would have attacked him mercilessly.  Yet it had to be done, and the world is better for it.\r\n\r\nOnly a so-called \"Social Justice Warrior\" could expose Requires Hate.  If a conservative white male had done it, liberals and feminists might have rallied to her defense (sad to say).\r\n\r\nI do believe that there are decent, honest, well-intentioned conservatives in our field, many of whom are deeply involved in the Sad Puppies movement.  Brad Torgensen and Larry Correia among them; my disagreements with them so far have been on the issues, but I don't believe that they are racists, sexists, misogynists, bigots, or haters.  But I do have a question for you:\r\n\r\nWhen are you going to do something about Vox Day?\r\n\r\nMake no mistake.  Vox Day and Requires Hate are twins.  Mirror images of one another.  The Toad of the West, the Toad of East, each of them spewing forth the venom of hatred and violence, poisoning any attempt at honest dialogue.  Requires Hate had her acolytes and enablers, and so does Vox Day, and it is from those toads that they derive their power.  \r\n\r\nLiberals and moderates and \"SJWs\" can denounce Day all they want, and it only serves to generate more hate, more division, more death threats.  His followers will just shrug that off.  But if some respected figure from the right were to speak up, well, maybe someone would listen.  But do we have a conservative in the house with the courage and integrity of Laura Mixon, someone honest enough and brave enough to denounce the excesses of their \"own side?\"\r\n\r\nI hope so.\r\n\r\nThat's what we need.  Fandom, our country, our world.  There will always be haters, that's part of human nature.  There will always be toads.  But we do not need to tolerate them.  Yes, I do believe in free speech, we should all be free to say whatever we want... but not without consequences.  And if your free speech is hatespeech, if you want to exercise your freedom by denouncing black people as savages, suggesting that gays should be raped straight, or calling down rape and acid attacks on writers whose books displeased you, you should not be surprised when you are shunned, abandoned, and denounced by all decent human beings.\r\n\r\nI want to be a part of a culture that has NO tolerance for death threats, rape threats, or hatespeech.  We are better than that.\r\n\r\nAren't we?","ditemid":419232,"eventtime":"2015-04-11 14:52:00","props":{"current_mood":"angry","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, politics","current_moodid":2,"commentalter":1429078146,"crosspost_tw":" Hatespeech http://j.mp/1aTZldz","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"angry","opt_screening":"F","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.637977737023578]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1428785529}","revtime":1429077884},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-11 20:51:34","anum":160,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html","event_timestamp":1428763920,"reply_count":304,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/102128346/925793","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20914336#t20914336","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20914336#t20914336","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20914336#t20914336","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hathy_col","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hathy-col.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20914336,"talkid":81696,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20914336#t20914336","upictitle":"Hathor: chaotica","article":"Excellently put, sir - as a woman in SF fandom, we need this kind of reasoned statement.

S. Williams: pic#124813155","article":"You're more optimistic than I am, Mr. Martin. John C. Wright is a man who is Vox Day's brother in terms of right-wing hate speech: he has called LGBT people abominations, and termites that need to be exterminated-- the latter merely in response to two girls holding hands on Legends of Korra. John C. Wright was actually a nominee on Brad Torgersen's slate.<br /><br />It seems as though Mr. Torgersen and Mr. Correia are quite happy to lay down with bigots if it gives them the power they're looking for. Mr. Wright's place in THREE slots for Best Novella, and Mr. Day's place on both editors' lists, suggests the Rabid Puppies had a lot to do with the success of the Sad Puppies-- and I hope I'm proven wrong, but I suspect the Sad Puppies ringleaders won't condemn Vox Day because they need the strength of their far right wing, like a mainstream Republican needs the strength of the Tea Party.<br /><br />Moreover, conservatives seem content to allow hate speech to thrive-- as long as it's not directed at them. In fact, even mild critiques directed at them are seen as intolerable; compare their hate for John Scalzi (who suggested that white guys have a bit of extra privilege in life) and Tempest Bradford (who suggested not reading straight white guys for a while) to their tolerance and defense of Vox Day, who has said far, far more odious things-- just not against them.<br /><br />For the Sad Puppies/Gamergate-type folk, it seems as though<br /><br />hate speech and insults = defensible criticism<br />rationally written critique = outrageous persecution<br /><br />It's Opposite Day in Right Wing land, and it has been for a while. I hope I'm wrong, but I suspect your plea will fall on deaf ears.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 11 2015, 21:48:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"You&#39;re More Optimistic Than I Am","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thewrittenpath.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thewrittenpath","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thewrittenpath","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thewrittenpath.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thewrittenpath","ctime_ts":1428788914,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20938656#t20938656","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20938656#t20938656","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20938656#t20938656","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20938656#t20938656","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"joshmst","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://joshmst.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20938656,"talkid":81791,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20938656#t20938656","above":20917664,"upictitle":"joshmst: pic#0","article":"This really is an excellent example of what SP and other conservatives are fighting against.

Yes, some individuals who oppose Gamergate have said and done horrible things, and some third-party trolls have antagonized both sides. But hundreds of people mocked Brianna Wu as her dog was dying, and accused her of killing it on purpose, and accused her of making it up for sympathy. They went so far as to create a Twitter account for her dying dog and tweet at her from it. One of their figureheads, Milo Yiannopolous, who is still followed and quoted by thousands of Gaters, said he would gladly swallow poison if he were her dog. (He wrote about the Hugos for Breitbart, you may recall.)<br /><br />These comments came in for twelve hours straight, and were favorited and retweeted hundreds of times by Gamergaters. This is one example of many; it happens to be the example that made me realize Gamergate was irredeemable, but you can take your pick. A few anti-Gamergaters have done terrible things, yes, but they have not benefited from the mob reinforcement that characterizes Gamergate.<br /><br />NOTE: I am not going to respond to pro-Gamergate replies to this comment, or post any more about Gamergate here.

Remember when SJWs tried to censor Game of Thrones over the \"rape\" scene last season? That's exactly what's going on with games. They're trying to destroy creative freedom and fundamentally change video games to suit their far-left agenda.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 11 2015, 22:19:06 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Gamergate","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jay-johnson12.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jay_johnson12","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jay_johnson12","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jay-johnson12.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jay_johnson12","ctime_ts":1428790746,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20922272#t20922272","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20922272#t20922272","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20922272#t20922272","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20922272#t20922272","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20922272,"talkid":81727,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/419232.html?thread=20922272#t20922272","above":20920992,"upictitle":"George R.R.

always been one of gamergates core principles:<br /><a href='http://gamesnosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/gamergate1.jpg' rel='nofollow'>http://gamesnosh.com/wp-content/upl<wbr

some people have been contributed to the movement.<br />and my political leaning is libertarian-Left, on some days i would even call me a socialist<br /><br />on the topic of puppygate:<br />quite frankly i am not informed enough on the topic, but as far as i can see what happend is something I(as a gamer) would call \"creative use of Game-Mechanics\"<br />which is exactly what is says: use of given mechanics that are absolutely within the rulebook, but can be exploited.<br />if i am not mistaken(again this is from an outsider looking in, it is quite possible i am overlooking crucial information) this is sadly the risk of a selection by popular vote, people can and WILL inevitably organize. it just so happens that people organized that have opinions that are vary right leaning(opinions that, so far as I can see, I would disagree with)<br /><br />two options seem \treasonable: switch over to a jury-based system OR organize your counter-voting group<br /><br />again, i am primarily a gamer and only a occasional Book-reader, and it appears to me that i am on a completely different political spectrum than the sad puppys. <br />Harassment sucks for people I like as well for people I dislike. and it should stop.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 11 2015, 22:22:08

Dornish Flag","article":"Why does online discussion descent into death threats and hyperbole so easily? It's the old standby excuse of \"anonymity\", although that's only part of it. I think a lot of the reason why there is so much venom is that the people spewing it probably can't say or do the things they want, when they want in \"real life\", so tend to unload when presented with the anonymity of the internet.<br /><br />If you've had rough week at work, but can't say what you're feeling on the grounds of being fired, or you're going through a tough time in a relationship and can't fully vent without causing a break-up, then sitting in front of a computer screen where you feel there are no consequences to what you say and do can be a way of unloading. The majority of people - I hope - self-edit and don't do that. But for some it's almost some kind of twisted therapy. It's also the old situation where the Internet, the great tool for communication which should have opened everyone's eyes up to the world and different viewpoints and opinions, has instead resulted in online ghettos forming where some people go to have their values and ideals reinforced, rather than challenged (and people on all sides of these arguments do that).<br /><br />I think we are better than that and I think we will see more self-editing going on as it becomes clearer that there are consequences for actions even taken online. But I worry that things will have to get a lot worse before they get better.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 11 2015, 22:22:29

It galls me that every single time someone brings up civility they act like it is only the people they disagree with that have a problem. I can easily provide examples from both sides of the aisle of people that resort to foul language and death threats from both sides of any issue people care about, yet only one side routinely calls for the other side to denounce the hate. <br /><br />Civility calls for me to say I hat to point this out, but I really don't. What I hate is the need for me to explain the obvious to people that think they can win an argument with me by pointing to the bad actions of other people in an attempt to make me feel guilty. I am not responsible for anyone else in any way, shape, or form. How would that work anyway?<br /><br />Is there some sort of approval system that everyone who agrees with me, your position? anyone else, has to go through before they can post anywhere on the internet? Are you personally responsible for the death threats and bad language use by everyone who even tangentially agrees with your position? Can I demand that you denounce the hate speech of those people before you make a comment on somthing I said? If not, what the bleep gives you the right to demand that someone stand up and denounce anyone else?<br /><br />If you personally want to take on hate speech, go for it, I don't have the disposition or the patience. Nor do I have the obligation to do so under any rational theory of anything. In fact, I don't even have the obligation not to use offensive language and personal insults when I respond to someone, even if they don't use them first. In fact, I am likely to toss out a causal insult and use offensive language when I wirte simply because I see it as a way to make my point.<br /><br />That does not mean I cannot think, it just means I understand the full poser of language and am willing to use it to make a point, and I don't give a fardle fart if the stench of my words offends you. In fact, I see it as a bonus because anyone that lets words offend them isn't going to be able to hang in there and actually debate this with me anyway.<br /><br />So, come on GRRM, you have all the advantages here, including the ability to simply delete my post and pretend it never existed. Why not prove how right you are by explaining why I need to stand up and denounce hate speech simply because you think your political position is better than mine.

They are fans, gamers, authors, etc whose beliefs simply reflect the changing social expectations that they have for themselves and others to act appropriately and honorably to each other.<br /><br />I wouldn't call myself a SJW but I have found myself more and more willing to speak up about things I feel strongly about. I have been a fan since I was a kid and got involved with fandom about 7ish years ago. Over the last couple of years (mainly do to the internet), I have found myself gaining the courage to speak more freely about what is and isn't acceptable behavior. <br /><br />As a former rape victim, I have grown up learning to be quiet about such things, but staying quiet just means that bad things will keep happening to innocent people. We must speak up, and that's what's happening. The SJWs aren't coming from outside. They're just feeling comfortable enough in our community of SF/F lovers to say the things that are important to them and to follow up those words with actions.<br /><br />That said… anyone from any part of the <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%23slategate\">#slategate</a> or <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%23puppypile\">#puppypile</a> discussion who is making death or rape threats is wrong, wrong wrong.
