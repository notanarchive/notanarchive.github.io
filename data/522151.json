{"itemid":2039,"subject":"Ed Bryant Talks Wild Cards","event":"Last August the hardcover of HIGH STAKES, the most recent Wild Cards mosaic novel, was released by Tor.  We launched the book at MidAmericon II in Kansas City with a huge mass signing sponsored by Rainy Day Books.  Most (though not all) of the contributors to HIGH STAKES were on hand, but so were a dozen other Wild Cards writers, even those not in that particular volume.  WC fans had a field day, collecting signatures from all the writers present.\r\n\r\nTor also had a video crew on hand, to tape the signing and to interview the writers about their involvement in Wild Cards, and any other projects they might be working on. They got hours of tape, and have been busily splicing and dicing and interweaving snippets of those interviews into a series of short promotional videos.  Three of those videos have been released to date, and can be found on our Wild Cards website http://www.wildcardsworld.com/wild-cards-media/   Many more will be coming.\r\n\r\nOne of the writers interviewed was Edward Bryant.\r\n\r\nAfter we heard about Ed's death, I contacted Tor to ask them if Ed had been one of the writers they had talked with in Kansas City.  I am pleased to say he was, and we can now present his interview to you complete and uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nAll those who knew and loved him will, I hope, appreciate the opportunity to see and hear from Ed one last time... but I should warn you, there is a bittersweet quality to this tape, in light of what was coming.  Sad to say, Ed never did finish that last Wild Cards story he was working on, nor any of the other tales that he hoped to write.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, all of us have to see <i><b>The Jolson Story</b></i>.  Be that as it may, for one last time, I am honored to present my friend Edward Bryant:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"876\"/>\r\n\r\n((My thanks to Patty Garcia, Sheila, and all the good folks at Tor for making this possible)).","ditemid":522151,"eventtime":"2017-02-20 15:33:00","props":{"current_mood":"melancholy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, life and death, worldcon, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Feb 21 22:33:20 2017]R [Tue Feb 21 22:33:21 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/834169164449316865 ","current_moodid":39,"commentalter":1487999220,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/834169164449316865","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"likes_first_notify":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.635365973785478]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1487716442}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2039?v=1488316971","revtime":1488316971},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-02-21 22:33:19","anum":167,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522151.html","event_timestamp":1487604780,"reply_count":7,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522151.html?thread=25760167#t25760167","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522151.html?thread=25760167#t25760167","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522151.html?thread=25760167#t25760167","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"milkforfree","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://milkforfree.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25760167,"talkid":100625,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/522151.html?thread=25760167#t25760167","upictitle":"milkforfree: pic#0","article":"Very affecting.
