{"itemid":1381,"subject":"The Amazing Maisie","event":"If you weren&#39;t at the Jean Cocteau Cinema on Monday night, you missed out on all the fun.\r\n\r\nWe had a great day.&nbsp; People started lining up as the sun was coming up, and the queue grew longer all day.&nbsp; We sent out coffee and donuts to make sure no one froze or starved to death while waiting in line.&nbsp; Doors opened at 6:00, with the show starting at 7:00pm, but Maisie Williams and the wolves turned up at 5:00 or so to meet the fans.&nbsp; Maisie is amazing... not only a talented young actress, but a delight in person.&nbsp; I think she spoke to everyone in line, signed their books and Funko Pop dolls, posed for pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone got into the theatre, alas, but everyone in line got to meet Maisie...\r\n\r\n&nbsp;... and the wolves. Flurry and Zorro, the wolf ambassadors from Wild Spirit, were great hits as well.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/185515/185515_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"20140119-DSC_6390\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/185515/185515_300.jpg\" title=\"20140119-DSC_6390\" width=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"20140119-DSC_6428\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/185686/185686_300.jpg\" title=\"20140119-DSC_6428\" width=\"203\" />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/186054/186054_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"20140119-DSC_6626\" height=\"173\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/186054/186054_300.jpg\" title=\"20140119-DSC_6626\" width=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMaisie is on her way back to LA now... but I think she liked Santa Fe, and one day we hope to have her back again.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the GOT marathon continues next Monday night at the Jean Cocteau.&nbsp; Next time we will be screening episodes nine and ten from season one -- &quot;Baelor&quot; and &quot;Fire and Blood.&quot;&nbsp; And we&#39;ll be joined by executive producers and showrunners DAVID BENIOFF and D.B. WEISS, who will be Skyping in after the episodes to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nLine up early.&nbsp; It&#39;s sure to be another epic crowd.","ditemid":353777,"eventtime":"2014-01-22 13:17:00","props":{"current_mood":"drained","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":40,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1390938542,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"revtime":1391411523},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-01-22 20:17:31","anum":241,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353777.html","event_timestamp":1390396620,"reply_count":43,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124463911/701220","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353777.html?thread=18630129#t18630129","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353777.html?thread=18630129#t18630129","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353777.html?thread=18630129#t18630129","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"13masquerade","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18630129,"talkid":72773,"etime_ts":"1390422529","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/353777.html?thread=18630129#t18630129","upictitle":"13MAC: 2014decemberphoto","article":"~Sending my spirit to be number one in line. ~","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"January 22 2014, 20:28:18 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I wish I&#39;ve met her!!

Keep up the good work! <br /><br />I am a resident of Belfast, Northern Ireland, and have greatly enjoyed following the progress of filming of Game of Thrones, with plenty of local interest.<br /><br />As a fly fisherman for trout and salmon, I enjoy many of our most remote, beautiful and timeless parts of my country, for example, out in my traditional lough boat on Lower lough Erne, stopping on one of its numerous islands for lunch in splendid isolation, or, solitary walking for miles of the banks of a local river out into the wild places of our countryside... I often find myself day dreaming, imagining scenes and encounters in an alternate time and place, with some characters akin to those in your books... Quite a distraction until I am jerked back to reality by the take of a fish.. <br /><br />For me, the books have re-opened my mind and reinvigorated my imagination to a younger time, before I became conditioned to thinking of little other than conventional reality.. I thank you for effectively returning my mind to me, where flights of fancy are once more prevalent, and I am reinvigorated to see beyond the mundane and the everyday commonplace perceptions of life... Scrape beneath the surface and there is always a richer, intricate tapestry to life, death and the world, such as that alternate version depicted in your fantastic books... World within worlds and wheels within wheels. Part of me, and millions of others, have had the privilege to share the world of A Song of Fire and Ice, and our lives are by far the richer for it.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Colin<br /><br />Colin Watterson","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"January 25 2014, 04:41:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Audiobooks","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://fisherman10-4.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"fisherman10_4","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"fisherman10_4","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://fisherman10-4.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"fisherman10_4","ctime_ts":1390624903,"tracked":0}]}
