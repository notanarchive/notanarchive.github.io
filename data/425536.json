They are only two blocks down from the Jean Cocteau, but we're friendly neighbors, and between us we hope to make the historic Railyard distinct THE place to see a movie in Santa Fe.   There are plenty of great movies out there (old and new) for all of us.\r\n\r\nThe Violet Crown will be opening to the public today with AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON.\r\n\r\nDown the street, at the Jean Cocteau, we will be showing ROAR.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"570\"/>\r\n\r\nSee you at the movies!!","ditemid":425536,"eventtime":"2015-05-01 12:14:00","props":{"current_mood":"chipper","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, santa fe, movie theatre","current_moodid":99,"commentalter":1430602538,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Movie Magic http://goo.gl/4YVJ9G","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.729037615361702]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430504075}","revtime":1430860391},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-05-01 18:13:52","anum":64,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425536.html","event_timestamp":1430482440,"reply_count":14,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124482509/73944396","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425536.html?thread=21570624#t21570624","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425536.html?thread=21570624#t21570624","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425536.html?thread=21570624#t21570624","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2965723","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/RyanPicklesimer","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21570624,"talkid":84260,"etime_ts":"1430504555","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/425536.html?thread=21570624#t21570624","upictitle":"Ryan Picklesimer: pic#124482509","article":"Wow, that trailer looks crazy!

They don't actually have Violet Crown but have iPic which is very upscale and Studio Movie Grill and AMC Dine In Theaters which are less swanky but still awesome. I don't really go to the movies that much but when I do it's usually for an event movie like Avengers 2 and I'll definitely be hitting it up in style at one of the aforementioned places. Should be great to have one of these right by your theater!
