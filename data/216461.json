{"itemid":845,"subject":"Come Visit FORT FREAK ","event":"Good news for all my Wild Cards readers.  FORT FREAK, volume twenty-one in the series, will be out in hardcover on June 21, Tor tells me.\r\n\r\nThe cover is once again by the amazing Michael Komarck, who just keeps getting better and better.  You really should nominate him for a Hugo some year, he's way overdue.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g8drp/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000g8drp/s640x480\" width=\"315\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter the wide-ranging global storylines of the Committee triad, FORT FREAK returns to New York City, the epicenter of the Wild Cards universe, to tell the stories of the cops and crooks of the historic 5th precinct of the NYPD — the Jokertown precinct. \r\n\r\nThe lineup this time around includes stories by Wild Cards veterans Melinda Snodgrass, Stephen Leigh, John Jos. Miller, Kevin Andrew Murphy, and Victor Milan, and introduces newcomers (new to Wild Cards, at least) Cherie Priest, David Anthony Durham, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Ty Franck, and Paul Cornell.  You can check out a sample of Cherie's interstitial, the literary mortar that holds all the bricks together, on my website.\r\n\r\nSo mark June 21 on your calendars, and place your preorder now with Amazon or your favorite local bookstore.  Come meet Ramshead, the Rook, Tabby, SlimJim, Abigail the understudy, Sgt. Squinch, Ratboy and Flipper, Tinkerbill, the Infamous Black Tongue, Natya, Maggie Graves, Puff, Beastie, Dr. Dildo, and the other colorful denizens of Fort Freak and environs. Old-timers like Father Squid, the Sleeper, and the Oddity are also expected to turn up to enliven the proceedings. \r\n\r\nAnd while you're reading, we'll be working on LOWBALL.","ditemid":216461,"eventtime":"2011-05-25 00:26:00","props":{"taglist":"tor, wild cards","commentalter":1306954418,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":3,"revtime":1307576773},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-05-17 06:26:40","anum":141,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html","event_timestamp":1306283160,"reply_count":23,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/33324088/296044","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535629#t13535629","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535629#t13535629","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535629#t13535629","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mizkit","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mizkit.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13535629,"talkid":52873,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535629#t13535629","upictitle":"kit: catie_cute","article":"Oh, that's *awesome*!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 17 2011, 07:55:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mizkit.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mizkit","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mizkit","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mizkit.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mizkit","ctime_ts":"1305618929","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/57295260/8049529","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535885#t13535885","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535885#t13535885","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535885#t13535885","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"the_corbie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://the-corbie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13535885,"talkid":52874,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13535885#t13535885","upictitle":"Iain: Croyd","article":"Exciting news!

I mean, when it's branded an ASoIaF product, we can except nothing short of a superior quality, right?:)<br /><br />And yeah, maybe it's not that bad to have people keeping you from playing after all, I know most of my friends (and I guess the vast majority of the blog readers as well) would kill me for recommending you videogames to play, as they seem to have a better idea of what you should do with your time(:P). Well, I at least hope you will play YOUR games, that could be treated as a part of your job anyway, so I hope people won't complain too much this time.<br /><br />At first I was quite skeptical of the idea of RPGs that are based on novels but then, when the Witcher came out in 2007 (and its sequel which was released just a few days ago and now it has a whooping 94/100 average on metacritic) I totally changed my mind and I'm eagerly waiting for more. <br /><br />The Witcher (based on the works of A. Sapkowski, I guess there are 2 of his books already available in English as of now; might be worth picking up) setting kind of reminds me that of ASoIaF, the game being more of a tale of a political struggle than that of saving the world, not shying away from the issues such as racial prejudice, sex, corruption, drug abuse, moral ambiguity and so on, all that while remaining a true to its core dark fantasy game which isn't sounding pretentious. True, its world is tangibly more magic/monsters heavy making it easier for a video game conversion, but it shows that making a great RPG out of \"A Song...\" is entirely doable if it only follows the right tracks that was set. Got excited for that!<br /><br />As for the strategies, yeah, Homeworld was a revolution of its era, and pretty much the last real revolution we've witnessed. That is not to say  there aren't also some great strategy games that came out afterwards, such as the Total Wars series, (there's even a fan-made \"Westeros\" mod for it:O) Europa Universalis or Sins of a Solar Empire as they are the true gems. Yet my biggest problem with strategies is that they eat out way too much of your time and you never really know when to stop it, so it indeed may be wise to stay away from them. RPGs are way safer as they are more like a book - you might totally sink into another world for a week, but after that you could honestly say you've finally beaten it...and start it all over again,(:)) but the point is, they have a storyline which has its ending, so you might as well try them from time to time (with caution, and as soon as you're done with Kong, that is:)).<br /><br />Greetings and sorry for my clumsy English.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 19 2011, 11:49:21 UTC","parent":13549709,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Videogames","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wersy2.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wersy2","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wersy2","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wersy2.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wersy2","ctime_ts":"1305805761","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/109024096/35969628","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13574285#t13574285","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13574285#t13574285","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13574285#t13574285","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_460020","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/datsingajonn","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13574285,"talkid":53024,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216461.html?thread=13574285#t13574285","upictitle":"Jonnathan Molina: pic#109024096","article":"I stumbled upon 'Wild Cards' when I was a kid in the shoppette of an army base in Hawaii.
