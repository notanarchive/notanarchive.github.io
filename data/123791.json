{"itemid":483,"subject":"Odds and Ends","event":"SUICIDE KINGS is out in hardcover (see below) and BUSTED FLUSH has been released in mass market.  Meanwhile, I've delivered the additional content -- three new stories -- for the first volume of this storied series, WILD CARDS itself, which Tor will be reissuing later in the year.  Since the first volume was historical in nature, telling the story of the wild card from 1946 to 1985, adding some original material to cover some of the \"lost years\" seemed like a natural.  \r\n\r\nThe three new tales:\r\n            -- \"Captain Cathode and the Secret Ace,\" by Michael Cassutt,\r\n            -- \"Powers,\" by David D. Levine,\r\n            -- \"Ghost Girl Takes Manhattan,\" by Carrie Vaughn.\r\n\r\nNo publication date yet.  You'll know when I do.\r\n\r\nAs for FORT FREAK, the twenty-first volume in the series that WILD CARDS began, first drafts are all in, I've given the usual editorial note, and the writers are all off revising.  This one looks to be a lot of fun.  The Class of 2009 is doing some great work, and the old-timers ain't half bad either.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, Gardner Dozois and I are very close to delivering our original cross-genre anthology STAR-CROSSED LOVERS, to Pocket Books.  We're waiting for some minor revisions from one writer.  Once those are in hand, the book will be delivered.  Only it's not STAR-CROSSED LOVERS any longer.  Pocket's sales force did not like that title, so the anthology has now been rechristened SONGS OF LOVE AND DEATH.  Got a great line up of writers for that one, including Diana Gabaldon, Jim Butcher, M.L.N. Hanover, Peter S. Beagle, Marjorie Liu, Jacqueline Carey, Carrie Vaughn, Robin Hobb, Neil Gaiman, and many more.  \r\n\r\nEverybody's talking about AVATAR, which I haven't seen yet... but I have been going to movies.  While the crowds queue up for Cameron, I've been catching up on some of the other films now in release.  I enjoyed THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, and liked INVICTUS as well, but the one that really impressed me was ME AND ORSON WELLES.  The guy who plays Welles should get an Oscar nomination for that performance.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I am way behind on my Xmas shopping.\r\n\r\nWhere does the time go?","ditemid":123791,"eventtime":"2009-12-22 17:55:00","props":{"taglist":"wild cards, anthologies","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1296105722,"picture_keyword":"ape","personifi_word_count":376,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"28:9,8:3,33:3,11:3,23:3,1:3,32:4,3:39,19:3,4:34,20:8,9:27,21:4,nterms:yes","interface":"flat"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-23 00:55:48","anum":143,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html","event_timestamp":1261504500,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/65907498/615482","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?replyto=8153487","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153487#t8153487","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153487#t8153487","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153487#t8153487","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tsgeisel","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8153487,"talkid":31849,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153487#t8153487","upictitle":"David: I hate this game","article":"You'll have more time once football season is over.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 23 2009, 00:59:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tsgeisel","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tsgeisel","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"tsgeisel","ctime_ts":1261529959,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/59950016/3466288","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?replyto=8153999","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153999#t8153999","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153999#t8153999","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153999#t8153999","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"joechummer","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://joechummer.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8153999,"talkid":31851,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/123791.html?thread=8153999#t8153999","upictitle":"joechummer: She-Hulk smiling","article":"For the record, I think the only real negative thing I've heard people say about AVATAR is that the plot is nothing we haven't seen before, that it's basically a sci-fi take on Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai.
