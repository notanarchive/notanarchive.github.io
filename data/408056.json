{"itemid":1593,"subject":"Two Great Nights","event":"We have had some great shows at the Jean Cocteau since we reopened a year and a half ago, but tonight and last night were among the very best.  Janis Ian was in town, and she gave two amazing shows to sellout crowds.  \r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who came.  And those who didn't... you really missed something special.\r\n\r\nDon't worry, though.  We plan to bring her back.","ditemid":408056,"eventtime":"2015-02-24 01:05:00","props":{"current_mood":"grateful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, music","current_moodid":132,"commentalter":1424828448,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Two Great Nights http://j.mp/1w5WUrY","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.66964581409368]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1424765156}","revtime":1425331100},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-02-24 08:05:18","anum":248,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/408056.html","event_timestamp":1424739900,"reply_count":3,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124639977/74439276","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/408056.html?thread=20305400#t20305400","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/408056.html?thread=20305400#t20305400","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/408056.html?thread=20305400#t20305400","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3027171","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/JohnVizcarra","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20305400,"talkid":79317,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/408056.html?thread=20305400#t20305400","upictitle":"John Vizcarra: pic#124639977","article":"Is the Janis Ian who came to the Cocteau the same Janis Ian who performed in the 70s and on the 1st episode of Saturday Night Live?
