{"itemid":2024,"subject":"Wild Cards Take Texas","event":"We're calling the latest Wild Cards volumes the America Triad.  First one up was MISSISSIPPI ROLL, which we completed and turned in back in October.  Then came LOW CHICAGO, delivered in December.  And now comes the third and final book in our cross country tour: TEXAS HOLD 'EM.  \r\n\r\nAnother one done.  The manuscript went off to our editors at Tor yesterday.  Hot damn! \r\n      \r\nThe table of contents for this one:\r\nCaroline Spector  \"Bubbles and the Band Trip\"\r\nMax Gladstone  \"The Secret Life of Rubberband\"\r\nWilliam F. Wu  \"Jade Blossom's Brew\"\r\nDiana Rowland \"Beats, Bugs, and Boys\"\r\nWalton Simons \"Is Nobody Going to San Antone?\"\r\nVictor Milan \"Dust and the Darkness\"\r\nDavid Anthony Durham \"Drop City\"\r\n\r\nTEXAS HOLD 'EM is the final book in the America Triad, and the twenty-sixth volume of the overall series... but no, it's not necessary to have read the first twenty-five to enjoy this one.  In fact, it's not even necessary to have read MISSISSIPPI ROLL and LOW CHICAGO (though we hope you will).  The America books are not a triad in the traditional sense, like the ones we have done before; they are more in the nature of three stand-alones, linked thematically rather than by plot.  Aside from a couple of double-dippers, each book of the three has a different roster of writers.\r\n\r\nThe cast in TEXAS HOLD 'EM includes long time fan favorites like the Amazing Bubbles, Mr. Nobody, and Rustbelt, and brings back a couple of minor players from past books in much bigger roles (Jade Blossom from INSIDE STRAIGHT, the Darkness from SUICIDE KINGS), but you'll meet a bunch of fun new characters as well.  Diana Rowland and Max Gladstone are here making their Wild Cards debuts (Abandon hope, all ye who enter here).  I think you'll love their work as much as I do.\r\n\r\nTEXAS HOLD 'EM is a departure for us in other ways as well.  Like the Marvel and DC universes, the Wild Cards universe is huge, and allows for all sorts of different stories.  Last summer's HIGH STAKES was our horror outing, and one of the darkest we have ever done.  TEXAS HOLD 'EM is the other side of the coin; a romp, light-hearted and frenetic, with touchs of screwball comedy.\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't mean it was easy.  \"Dying is easy.  <i><b>Comedy</b></i> is hard,\" someone once said (just who is a matter of dispute).  \r\n\r\nLook for TEXAS HOLD 'EM sometime next year.  At last word, Tor is slating MISSISSIPPI ROLL for publication in hardcover in the fall of this year, with Chicago and Texas to follow, but we don't have hard dates for those two yet, but you'll know when we do.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we have further Wild Cards books in mind... and that TV series in the works...\r\n\r\nRemember, we can't die yet.  We haven't seen the Jolson Story.","ditemid":518386,"eventtime":"2017-01-27 15:52:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, anthologies, editing","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Jan 28 22:52:32 2017]R [Sat Jan 28 22:52:33 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/825476684723978242 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1492274337,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/825476684723978242","picture_keyword":"wcposter","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.667668282899677]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1485643960}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2024?v=1485644500","revtime":1485644498},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-28 22:52:31","anum":242,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/518386.html","event_timestamp":1485532320,"reply_count":8,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/518386.html?replyto=25672946","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/518386.html?thread=25672946#t25672946","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/518386.html?thread=25672946#t25672946","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/518386.html?thread=25672946#t25672946","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"drtachyon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://drtachyon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25672946,"talkid":100284,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/518386.html?thread=25672946#t25672946","upictitle":"Dr. Tachyon: pic#0","article":"Mr. Martin!
