{"itemid":492,"subject":"Gang Green","event":"So the Jets went to Cincinnati to play the Bengals in the first round of the playoffs.  This time no one was lying down, Cincinnati had all its starters and played hard.\r\n\r\nWhat can I say?  Only this\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"16\"/>\r\n\r\nThe kid quarterback came through, the running game kicked ass, and the Gang Green defense hung tough.  They gave up way too many yards to Cedric Benson, but made Carson Palmer look like the rookie, not Sanchez.  And Revis shut down Ochocinco once again, despite the refs helping out Ocho with several truly bogus calls against Darrell.\r\n\r\nNext week will be much tougher.  I'll just savor this one for a while.\r\n\r\nThe evening game... well, that was distressing.  Philadelphia let down the Green Team badly.  How can the Eagles play so well against my Giants whenever they meet, and stink up the place against the hated Cowboys three times in the same season???\r\n\r\nDallas looked unstoppable.  But they are still evil.  The sight of Jerry Jones laughing and grinning and slapping high-fives with W almost made me gag.  The worst owner in sports and the worst president in my lifetime yukking it up.\r\n\r\nSigh.

Not that he should be excused; but for a Republican, Nixon was actually fairly moderate.  He even supported the Negative Income Tax, against the party line.  Carter would have made a first-class Secretary of State, but really wasn't cut out to handle the stress of being President.  Neither were good, but don't approach the level of depraved ignorance of the Bush Administration.  No other President since John Adams has passed laws undermining our Constitutional and civil rights.  The Bush team ran the country like a mafia, with a level of corruption previously unseen.  The m.o. of the Bush/Cheney/Rove playbook was cronyism, kickbacks, back-room deals, fabricating evidence when necessary and destroying the paper trail if caught.  Burning a federal agents cover in retalliation for blowing the whistle. Forcing Colin Powell to lie to Congress and then making him the scapegoat for the Iraq WMD quagmire.  Lying to the American people on nearly a daily basis. Manipulating everyone with weapons of mass distraction; through fearmongering and artificial \"threat levels,\" in order to keep up public opinion on their wars of agression in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Sacrificing our troops without clear objectives or a reasonable exit strategy.  The original goal of capturing (or killing) Osama Bin Laden has become an afterthought.  Bin Laden has become the Goldstein character from Orwell's \"1984.\" He's only used for the American version of the \"Two Minutes Hate.\" Meanwhile, at home, Bush was busy handing out millions to the rich in tax breaks while the economy started to decline.  In response to the decline, the rich got more millions and socked it away, while the economic decline spiraled into the worst recession since the Great Depression.  Racial profiling, wiretaps, torture, etc., etc., etc.<br />George W. Bush ranks right up there with Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler on the list of worst world leaders in history.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years
