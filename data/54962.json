{"itemid":214,"subject":"Any Given Sunday","event":"Another week in the NFL.  The Giants won an ugly one over the Niners, and the Jets lost an uglier one to the Raiders.  I have to admit, both games frustrated the hell out of me.\r\n\r\nThe Giants defense showed up again, after having taken off the Cleveland game.  Six sacks, lots of pressure on the quarterback, three turnovers, even a safety.  That was the good news.  The offense left much to be desired, however.  The G-Men are now 5-1, but the creampuff portion of their schedule is over.  Next week they face another 5-1 team in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and we'll get the first true indication of how good they are.  \r\n\r\nAs for the Jets... sigh... \r\n\r\nThe whole team played like crap in Oakland, but I have to blame the coaching for this loss.  After Brett Favre passes them down the field with a minute left to set up the field goal that sent the game into overtime, the Jets win the coin toss... and Mangini and Little Schott turn more conservative than Rush Limbaugh.  Run on first down, run on second down, throw on third and long.  Not once, but on all of our overtime possessions.  The Raider defense was gassed and demoralized by the end of regulation; if the Jets had come out in overtime and continued with the same wide-open passing attack that had tied the game, I'm convinced they would have claimed the victory.\r\n\r\nSad to say, the Jets are not playing like a playoff contender at this point.","ditemid":54962,"eventtime":"2008-10-20 11:53:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":260,"current_moodid":1,"commentalter":1225070515,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-10-20 18:05:35","anum":178,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/54962.html","event_timestamp":1224503580,"reply_count":52,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/65862744/1947702","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/54962.html?replyto=4337074","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/54962.html?thread=4337074#t4337074","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/54962.html?thread=4337074#t4337074","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/54962.html?thread=4337074#t4337074","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"puppetmaker40","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://puppetmaker40.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4337074,"talkid":16941,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/54962.html?thread=4337074#t4337074","upictitle":"puppetmaker40: Peter David and Me","article":"I am still on the fence as to what the Jets can or can't do.<br />Consistence seems to be a problem with both the offense and the defense.<br /><br />The Giants are only hurting themselves.

I live in Australia so rarely get to watch the games I'd like so can't comment on the game but I will say the Giants Monday night game last week showed fragile shell flaws in the current champs. It is true that the Steelers will really test them but what has happened to the powerhouse era. I mean I know the league of parity but this year its ridiculous no team seems to be standing out in either league, there is no game which its safe to call. Tennessee vs Indy will really establish if they are a legit steamroller this year.<br /><br />It is sad the Jets and there coaching staff don't seem to be able to let go Farve, he is a unique player who plays with the free ease of a phenom who truly loves the game. His gift is to play loose mostly it works sometimes it burns but it is always amazing to watch. The Jets coaches don't seem to embrace this they are playing not to loose and that is the antithesis of the Farve style and it shows.<br /><br />Well the 49ers are dead this year I wonder when it will change. The Giants will win the East (the Cowboys are about to combust) but I think the path to the Superbowl goes through Carolina.
