My mother-in-law also has this, and my departed father-in-law died of it.<br />The first symptom for my parents was when they forgot to pay their property taxes, and my sister and I had to step in and pay their town.  <br />McCain not only made a slip of the tongue about how many houses he owns, but he also did not pay his property taxes on one of them.  A quick slip of the tongue might indicate momentary fatigue, but non-payment of property taxes indicates a much deeper forgetfulness.  At 72 years old, he is way too young... maybe.  At least he should be tested, because forgetfulness isn't the only symptom of concern.  My father panics if startled, and he is easily startled.  My mother falls asleep during discussions.  My father cannot start new activities on his own, because his executive function has diminished.  Tempers flare: my father-in-law had that problem with dementia, including suddenly hitting his wife for the first time.  Both of my parents cannot make decisions for themselves, and are also too likely to sign documents they shouldn't sign (so my sister and I have a PoA).  McCain's medical records are not public; it is only known that he takes sleeping pills.  He has made numerous mistakes of facts and figures.  This really needs to be checked out... because executive function is the most needed asset of any President, no matter what political Party they belong to.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"August 30 2008, 05:28:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"A President&#39;s mind must have an executive function...
