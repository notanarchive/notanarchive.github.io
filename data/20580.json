And while it may not affect Belichick that much (if, as a rumor was going around during the team's off-season spending spree, he's actually planning on retiring if he wins it all this year), but it'll sure irk Kraft, and maybe ownership will put weight on Belichick to stop doing this stuff.  In addition, a fine of half a million dollars is hefty, especially for a coach who doesn't seem to supplement his base salary with endorsements or book sales.<br /><br />What were the alternatives?  A suspension for a game or two?  What would that really matter?  The team can still win without Belichick, and even if they lost those games, there's so much talent that they'd still make the playoffs.<br /><br />I'm a die-hard Giants fan (I don't have as much interest in the Jets as you do), so I'm not coming from the same place you are when I look at this.  But the fact is that the Jets are not in the same league as the Pats this year (though Mangini is doing an impressive job building the team in the right way), and they probably weren't going to win the game no matter how much the Pats did or didn't cheat.  I actually agree with many of the points made <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/070912\" rel=\"nofollow\">by Bill Simmons on espn.com</a>.  It's bad, the Pats were punished in a way that is going to create a strong disincentive for other clubs to do the same thing, and by next week, the Pats (and everyone else) will be looking for some new way around the rules.<br /><br />It's just the way of sports.

If the NFL is really serious about deterring this sort of thing, Bellicheck or however you spell it should be suspended for the whole season, or even a couple of years -- they throw out Ricky Williams for whole seasons for smoking pot, which is the equivalent of a traffic ticket violation in some states, legal other places, and isn't even a performance enhancer, fer cryin's sake.  And if the Pats can be shown to have known about it (and of course they knew about it, but a little proof would be nice) or it can be established that they should have known about it, the team needs a MUCH bigger fine -- the franchise is worth hundreds of millions, I don't think they are gonna notice or care about 250k -- you might as well fine them monopoly money.<br /><br />And this is from someone who isn't a particular fan of *any* team, or pro football as a whole, so I'm fairly disinterested.  Certain sorts of cheating bug me much more than others for what they say about the psychology behind it, and this was one of the more bugging types.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"September 14 2007, 18:04:04 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Agreeing w/you and taking it a step further . . .","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mojave-wolf.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mojave_wolf","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mojave_wolf","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mojave-wolf.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mojave_wolf","ctime_ts":1189793044,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20580.html?replyto=2461028","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20580.html?thread=2461028#t2461028","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20580.html?thread=2461028#t2461028","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20580.html?thread=2461028#t2461028","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2461028,"talkid":9613,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/20580.html?thread=2461028#t2461028","upictitle":"George R.R.
