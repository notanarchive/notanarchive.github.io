{"itemid":351,"subject":"Some More Cool Miniatures","event":"Just because.\r\n\r\nHere's another one from Jen Haley.  This is the Night's Watch raven keeper figure from Dark Sword, but since I've already got several examples of him in NW black, I had her do this one as a Stark retainer.  Not quite how I picture Maester Luwin, but maybe his predecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004rh7g/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004rh7g/s320x240\" width=\"205\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004skqb/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004skqb\" width=\"166\" height=\"216\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd here is Jen's take on Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers, one of Tom Meier's most spectacular sculpts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004t09d/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004t09d/s320x240\" width=\"192\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004wape/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004wape/s320x240\" width=\"177\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nJen is not the only painter I use (I no longer seem to have the time or energy to paint myself, but even when I did, I was nowhere in the class of the \"hired brushes\" I employ).\r\n\r\nHere's a piece by Matt Verzani, Dark Sword's official house painter.  It's the archer figure from the Night's Watch, another great Tom Meier piece, but in this case we've painted him as Theon Greyjoy.  (We have an actual Theon figure coming, sculpted by Jeff Grace, and greens can be seen on the Dark Sword website, but that one hasn't been released yet).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004x3ze/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004x3ze/s320x240\" width=\"190\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004y4zs/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004y4zs/s320x240\" width=\"181\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nNext we have another Verzani, this one his paint of Rattleshirt, the Lord o' Bones.  This time the sculpt is by Jeff Grace.\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004z585/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0004z585/s320x240\" width=\"187\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnother fine painter that I commission from time to time is Dave Gulczynski of WarPaint Miniatures.  Here's his version of the lady of the court.\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00050a2y/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00050a2y/s320x240\" width=\"149\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd finally this one, Dave's version of one of Jeff Grace's wildling figures, the spearwife with the sword.  \r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00051kp4/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00051kp4/s320x240\" width=\"296\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00052y1r/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00052y1r/s320x240\" width=\"293\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThere's lots more, but that should hold you for now.
