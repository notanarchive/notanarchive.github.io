{"itemid":795,"subject":"If I Had a Hammer...","event":"... I'd hammer some more on Kong, actually.\r\n\r\nHey, but I CAN have a hammer.  And so can you, thanks to the good folks at Valyrian Steel, who have just unveiled their design for King Robert's warhammer.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f6esb/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000f6esb/s640x480\" width=\"293\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlas, you can't order the hammer just yet.  We're still in the design stage, but I have approved these drawings, so the next step is the prototype, which is now being made.  Once I approve that, production can begin.  And along about there somewhere, Valyrian Steel will begin taking orders.\r\n\r\nFor more details, check out their website at http://www.valyriansteel.com/\r\n\r\nYes, it is a big hammer.  A very big hammer.  Going to be heavy as well.  I insisted on that.  After all, it says right in the book that Robert's warhammer was so huge and heavy that only someone with his own freakish strength could wield it.  So I kept telling them, \"bigger, bigger.\"\r\n\r\nValyrian Steel has done some lovely versions of Longclaw, Needle, and Ice (all of which remain available from their store), but I think the hammer is my favorite to date.","ditemid":203595,"eventtime":"2011-03-17 17:30:00","props":{"taglist":"valyrian steel","current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1300977123,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1301172547},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-03-20 23:33:34","anum":75,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html","event_timestamp":1300383000,"reply_count":45,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124674832/7829865","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645451#t12645451","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645451#t12645451","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645451#t12645451","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"anywhere_but_nj","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://anywhere-but-nj.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12645451,"talkid":49396,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645451#t12645451","upictitle":"Anywhere_But_NJ: teacher","article":"I prefer swords but the detail...oh that is amazing.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 20 2011, 23:36:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://anywhere-but-nj.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"anywhere_but_nj","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"anywhere_but_nj","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://anywhere-but-nj.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"anywhere_but_nj","ctime_ts":1300664201,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645707#t12645707","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645707#t12645707","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645707#t12645707","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645707#t12645707","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12645707,"talkid":49397,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12645707#t12645707","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"That's an amazing design.

There are few different kinds of t-shirts (all the houses arms, plus tv series logos with crows), but they offer so far male models, and they are all of pretty poor quality. The shop assistants claims that it's all gonna change in 2 weeks, when they will deliver the whole new bunch of gadgets and clothes.<br /><br />One of the employees said that he is lobbying at the merchandise department to make a hooded sweatshirt, where the hood would be a hound's head and there would be \"Beware of the Hound\" sing on the back of the sweatshirt.

Why? A dragon is clearly fantastical. It's not like there are real dragons to compare it to and say \"well clearly this dragon is not a realistic dragon.\" There are no real sorceresses to compare to and say, \"well obviously this is not a realistic sorceress.\"<br /><br />War hammers, and other weapons, are the opposite. They are real things that are governed by real rules. Robert's war hammer wasn't magic. I mean, the whole reason Robert used a war hammer is for a realistic reason - real plate and mail is pretty effective against swords. It's hard to stick a guy in the joint bits. A hammer will transmit the impact force through the armor, or a spike on the hammer - like Robert's - can penetrate more effectively than a sword.<br /><br />Those are REALISTIC considerations. So when we see the hammer it's disappointing that... it's not realistic at all. It's not that it's \"oh that's kind of big for a war hammer\" or \"oh I guess a really big guy like Robert could wield it\", no. It's so big that it's impossible that any non-magical human could wield it.<br /><br />As for all the people saying, \"Well Robert was really big!\", that's actually more the reason this hammer is annoying. Bigger men are comparatively WORSE OFF in armored combat, not better. That's actually why I love that one chapter towards the end of the 2nd book - with our favorite little person outside King's Landing? Smaller men are actually better off when everyone is wearing armor. The weight of the armor needed to cover a larger man increases exponentially, because his surface area increases. But his strength increase proportionally - it increases at much a slower rate. Endurance decreases as well, since the larger body is all the less efficient.<br /><br />This isn't to say big men aren't stronger and potentially faster. They may well be - if you want to see some really scary fast huge guys, watch sumo. But plate and mail fitted to their size is going to counter much of that natural advantage. An oversized war hammer isn't going to be necessarily easier for them to use.<br /><br />(This is the same reason you don't see exoskeletal creatures like beetles and crabs grow past a certain size, except under water with buoyancy to assist.) <br /><br />So in other words, Robert being huge is all the more reason he SHOULDN'T be able to wield an \"oversize\" hammer. Not that maybe he couldn't wield a relatively larger one - but it is NOT an argument in favor of it.<br /><br />One of the things that is so nice about ASOIAF is the normally high level of historical detail and realism - the lack of typical fantasy silliness, or, as someone called it, the \"MMO/anime\" vibe. This war hammer is disappointing because it feels exactly that \"MMO/anime\" vibe.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"March 23 2011, 15:55:47 UTC","parent":12660299,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: I love it","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mod4finil","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mod4finil","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mod4finil","ctime_ts":1300895747,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12668747#t12668747","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12668747#t12668747","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12668747#t12668747","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jakevti","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jakevti.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12668747,"talkid":49487,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12668747#t12668747","above":12663371,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","parent":12663371,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: I love it","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jakevti.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jakevti","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jakevti","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jakevti.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jakevti","ctime_ts":1300911751,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12671563#t12671563","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12671563#t12671563","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12671563#t12671563","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mod4finil","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12671563,"talkid":49498,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12671563#t12671563","above":12668747,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","parent":12668747,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: I love it","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mod4finil","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mod4finil","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mod4finil.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mod4finil","ctime_ts":1300931533,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12673099#t12673099","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12673099#t12673099","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12673099#t12673099","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jakevti","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jakevti.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12673099,"talkid":49504,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/203595.html?thread=12673099#t12673099","above":12671563,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","parent":12671563,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: I love it","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jakevti.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jakevti","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jakevti","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jakevti.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jakevti","ctime_ts":1300955300,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0}]}
