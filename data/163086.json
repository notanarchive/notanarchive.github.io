{"itemid":637,"subject":"Two Lords and a Sword","event":"Hiya kids, hiya, hiya, hiya.\r\n\r\nThis time we have two lords and a knight.  \r\n\r\nThe first never says a word in the books.  The second gave up one lordship and received another.  The third birthed a monkey, a pimple, and a loon.   \r\n\r\nThe first flew by night to find the truth.  The second is a merry man from the god of war.  The third was a supervillain, and once ambled amongst oak trees and hollies, where he might have come across a golden rose.\r\n\r\nWho are they?\r\n\r\nEVENING UPDATE:  Not bad, not bad.  But I'm glad that I've been able to stump you for longer than it takes for my webpage to refresh.  For a change.  At of this moment (about 7:45 PM Santa Fe time), you've got the sword but not the lords.  A few of you may be sniffing on the trail of another.  The last... well, mea culpa, the clue there is really obscure.\r\n\r\nLook for big casting news on the morrow.  Lots of parts, not necessarily including these.","ditemid":163086,"eventtime":"2010-07-15 13:38:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":36,"commentalter":1279313853,"personifi_word_count":176,"picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"18:9,6:4,31:13,11:13,46:4,23:4,32:4,3:22,19:4,4:9,20:27,9:22,21:4,22:9,nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":2,"revtime":1279244835},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-07-15 19:38:55","anum":14,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html","event_timestamp":1279201080,"reply_count":62,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html?replyto=10527246","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html?thread=10527246#t10527246","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html?thread=10527246#t10527246","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html?thread=10527246#t10527246","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html?thread=10527246#t10527246","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10527246,"talkid":41122,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/163086.html?thread=10527246#t10527246","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Ser Ilyn Payne, Lord Mormont, and Ser Alliser Thorne are the characters, at least.
