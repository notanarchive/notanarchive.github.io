{"itemid":2029,"subject":"GENIUS","event":"A few posts down you'll find my Hugo Award ruminations for the Dramatic Presentation categories, where I opine at some length about the best films and television shows I saw last year.\r\n\r\nMuch as I love SF and fantasy, however, not everything I read or view falls into those categories.  I wanted to say a few words about another movie I saw recently, and loved.\r\n\r\nIt's a film called GENIUS, a period piece set in the 1930s about the relationship between Maxwell Perkins, the legendary Scribners editor, and his most troubled (and troubling) writer, Thomas Wolfe.  (No, not Tom Wolfe, the 60s journalist of THE RIGHT STUFF fame,<i><b> Thomas </b></i>Wolfe, the doomed 30s novelist of YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN).  Stars Colin Firth and Jude Law, both of whom gave brilliant performances.  Scripted by John Logan, directed by Michael Grandage.\r\n\r\nGENIUS came and went last year almost unnoticed.  It was certainly unnoticed by me, else I would have tried to book it for the Jean Cocteau.  But it's running on HBO right now, so all those who missed it (virtually everyone) now has another chance to see it.\r\n\r\nI hope you do.  Especially if you're a writer, or an editor, or have any interest in 20th Century American literature, Thomas Wolfe, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, or Maxwell Perkins.\r\n\r\nThe movie got very little notice from the world at large, but I loved loved loved it.  Maybe because it's a writer's movie.  The period is wonderfully evoked, the acting is fine, and there's one ten minute scene in the middle of the movie... from when Wolfe delivers OF TIME AND THE RIVER till when Perkins gets on that train... that I thought was just hilarious, heart-breaking, poetic, painful, and just all-around... blue.  A blue that was deeper than blue, a blue such as never before... \r\n\r\nWell, let's just say it was a great scene in a fine movie.\r\n\r\nLots of fine movies came out last year, in our genre and out of it.  Many of them have been nominated for various Oscars.  GENIUS was not, but if I were in the Academy I would certainly have nominated it.  Much I loved ARRIVAL and MOANA and some of the other big movies of 2016, I think GENIUS was my favorite film from last year.","ditemid":519459,"eventtime":"2017-01-29 22:20:00","props":{"current_mood":"impressed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"writing, movies, films, editing","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Jan 31 22:38:24 2017]R [Tue Jan 31 22:38:25 2017]Cannot extract userid, tweetid from Twitter response ","current_moodid":116,"commentalter":1492274317,"crosspost_tw":"Cannot extract userid, tweetid from Twitter response","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"likes_first_notify":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.643542801789078]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1485902311}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2029?v=1486252218","revtime":1486252218},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-31 22:38:20","anum":35,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html","event_timestamp":1485728400,"reply_count":14,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25692707#t25692707","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25692707#t25692707","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25692707#t25692707","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3998619","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/112860152697755358939","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25692707,"talkid":100362,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25692707#t25692707","upictitle":"Logan Yake: pic#0","article":"Have you watched any Black Mirror?

Since very few people actually read anymore, prospective audience members are unfamiliar with the biographical subjects except as cultural tropes. There’s always this sense that you’re watching a cowboy movie or a medieval romance or some other depiction of the standard bearers of some lost civilization. <br /><br />Genius is filmed entirely in sepia – just in case you’re too stupid to pick up that its subtext is Depression-era New York City. Maxwell Perkins never takes off his hat. <br /><br />And was the relationship between Thomas Wolfe and Maxwell Perkins somehow more important than, say, the relationship between Scott Fitzgerald and Maxwell Perkins, or the relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Maxwell Perkins?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"February 1 2017, 16:21:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mallorys-camera.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mallorys_camera","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mallorys_camera","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mallorys-camera.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"mallorys_camera","ctime_ts":1485966087,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25708579#t25708579","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25708579#t25708579","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25708579#t25708579","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25708579,"talkid":100424,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519459.html?thread=25708579#t25708579","above":25706275,"upictitle":"George R.R.
