Terrell, performing selections from the Pandemonium Jukebox.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"363\" />\r\n\r\nThe show starts at 9 pm.&nbsp; Admission only $5.&nbsp; We do not, alas, have our liquor license yet (though we&#39;re working on it)... but we will have plenty of pizza, popcorn, pastries, soft drinks to accompany the music.\r\n\r\nAnd for those whose mommies let them stay out late, after Turner and Terrell we have our midnight show (which actually starts at 11pm), V/H/S 2.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"364\" />\r\n\r\n((The midnight movie is a separate admission)).\r\n\r\nSee you at the show.","ditemid":334752,"eventtime":"2013-09-07 14:19:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe... for now","taglist":"jean cocteau, music, santa fe","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1378756397,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"froggy","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1378756418},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-09-07 20:19:25","anum":160,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/334752.html","event_timestamp":1378563540,"reply_count":7,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/33324088/296044","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/334752.html?thread=18171040#t18171040","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/334752.html?thread=18171040#t18171040","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/334752.html?thread=18171040#t18171040","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mizkit","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mizkit.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18171040,"talkid":70980,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/334752.html?thread=18171040#t18171040","upictitle":"kit: catie_cute","article":"Hah!
