{"itemid":1207,"subject":"Sad News","event":"We have had some sad news from the UK, regarding one of our stalwarts from HBO's GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nI will let the press release speak for itself:\r\n\r\n \"WILKO JOHNSON â€“ IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n\r\nI am very sad to announce that Wilko has recently been diagnosed with terminal\r\ncancer of the pancreas. He has chosen not to receive any chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nHe is currently in good spirits, is not yet suffering any physical effects and\r\ncan expect to enjoy at least another few months of reasonable health and\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nHe has just set off on a trip to Japan; on his return we plan to complete a new\r\nCD, make a short tour of France, then give a series of farewell gigs in the UK.\r\nThere is also a live DVD in the pipeline, filmed on the last UK tour.\r\n\r\nWilko wishes to offer his sincere thanks for all the support he has had over his\r\nlong career, from those who have worked with him to, above all, those devoted\r\nfans and admirers who have attended\r\nhis live gigs, bought his recordings and generally made his life such an\r\nextraordinarily full and eventful experience.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nRobert Hoy\r\n(Manager)\"\r\n\r\n(GRRM back).  I never had the chance to meet Wilko Johnson during any of my visits to the set, but I certainly liked what he has been doing in the role of our silent headsman, Ser Ilyn Payne.  He will be missed.\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen people have sent me that press release above, by the way.  (The story appeared in the GUARDIAN and other UK newspapers).  Many of them want to know if the part of Ser Ilyn will be recast.  I'm sorry, but I have no answer.  At this juncture, it would premature even to discuss the issue, I think.  Anyway, no one has discussed it with me, nor would I expect them to.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the good work, Wilko... and for all the joy your music gave your fans.  You'll leave the world a richer place than you found it, and more than that cannot be asked of any man.","ditemid":309128,"eventtime":"2013-01-10 18:50:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":25,"commentalter":1360690958,"picture_keyword":"scotland","opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1359222771},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-01-19 01:50:39","anum":136,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html","event_timestamp":1357843800,"reply_count":22,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119883236/59290424","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?replyto=17151624","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151624#t17151624","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151624#t17151624","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151624#t17151624","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1603149","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/anacarolinars","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17151624,"talkid":66998,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151624#t17151624","upictitle":"Ana Carolina S.: pic#119883236","article":"I think the last thing that we will have to worry right now is about the role anda what will be done. <br /><br />Sad, sad news...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"January 19 2013, 02:27:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/anacarolinars","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"anacarolinars","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1603149","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=59290424&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"anacarolinars","ctime_ts":1358562441,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/114707038/15130962","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?replyto=17151880","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151880#t17151880","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151880#t17151880","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151880#t17151880","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"elkissa","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://elkissa.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17151880,"talkid":66999,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/309128.html?thread=17151880#t17151880","upictitle":"elkissa: pic#114707038","article":"It is indeed sad, but there is time reserved for all of us to go through difficulties, changes, good times, sad times...it is part of one's journey.
