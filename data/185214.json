{"itemid":723,"subject":"Look!  Up in the Sky!  ","event":"It's a bird.  It's a plane.  It's... yes, actually, it IS a plane.  Jetboy's plane.  And a whole bunch of blimps.\r\n\r\nWILD CARDS is back.  I'm talking volume one, originally published in 1987, the book that introduced a universe of high-flying aces and twisted jokers, and kicked off a series that is still going strong today, twenty-three years later.  Tor has just released a reissue of the book in trade paperback format.  It went on sale today, and you'll find it in your favorite local bookstore... most likely, right next to SONGS OF LOVE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dar46/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dar46/s320x240\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nNow, maybe you're one of the hundreds of thousands of readers who already has a copy of WILD CARDS sitting on your shelf, so you figure you don't need to snap this one up.  Well, you'd be wrong.  We didn't just re-release the original book, we improved it with extra added content -- three brand new stories, by Michael Cassutt, David D. Levine, and Carrie Vaughn, covering some of the \"lost years\" in the Wild Cards timeline.  Secret histories and tales untold till now.  \r\n\r\nThe new stories are \"Captain Cathode and the Secret Ace\" by Michael Cassutt, \"Powers\" by David D. Levine, and \"Ghost Girl Takes Manhattan\" by Carrie Vaughn, stellar additions to the original lineup of work from Howard Waldrop, Roger Zelazny, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Walter Jon Williams, Lewis Shiner, Victor Milan, Edward Bryant, Leanne C. Harper, Stephen Leigh, John Jos. Miller, and yours truly.  Jetboy, Dr. Tachyon, Fortunato, Yeoman, the Sleeper, Golden Boy, Mark Meadows, Sewerjack and Bagabond, Puppetman, and the Great and Powerful Turtle... they're all back, and this time they've brought friends.","ditemid":185214,"eventtime":"2010-11-23 21:30:00","props":{"current_location":"home","personifi_word_count":286,"taglist":"wild cards, anthologies","opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1291866895,"personifi_tags":"15:2,28:4,18:14,8:2,11:6,32:6,3:57,19:2,4:38,20:16,9:16,21:4,22:10,nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-11-24 04:30:24","anum":126,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185214.html","event_timestamp":1290547800,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185214.html?replyto=11367806","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185214.html?thread=11367806#t11367806","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185214.html?thread=11367806#t11367806","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185214.html?thread=11367806#t11367806","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"elicius","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://elicius.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11367806,"talkid":44405,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/185214.html?thread=11367806#t11367806","upictitle":"Elicius: pic#98810883","article":"I got this in the post around midday yesterday and immediately started reading.
