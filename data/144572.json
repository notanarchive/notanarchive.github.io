{"itemid":564,"subject":"Jaime's Challenge","event":"The good news:  Jaime Lannister pulled it out and defeated Kvothe.  Came from 700 votes behind in the final hours to win handily... all thanks to you guys, of course.  Thanks to all of you who voted for him... and all of you who voted for his opponent (misguided though you are).  And to Patrick Rothfuss, a fine writer and a good sport, who made this round a lot of fun.  RIP, Kvothe.\r\n\r\nThe bad news: Jaime is in the final, and his opponent is Rand al'Thor.  \r\n\r\nLet me see.  Rand is a master swordsman.  He's got one of those \"heron mark\" swords, which is probably the equal of Valyrian steel. He's the reincarnation of the greatest hero and wizard in the history of Robert Jordan's universe.  He's got balefire.  And then there's that whole ta'veren thing he's got going.\r\n\r\nJaime has gilded armor, a shield, a Valyrian steel sword, and a dwarf.\r\n\r\nBugger.\r\n\r\n\"Here's my counsel for this round,\" Tyrion said.  \"Run away.  Don't look back.\"\r\n\r\nJaime is not impressed.  \"A Lannister does not run.\"\r\n\r\n\"This one does,\" said Tyrion, \"but I figured you'd say that.  So here's what you need to do to have ANY hope of surviving this one...\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000972p3/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000972p3\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nJaime's last match was fought on Kvothe's home turf.  An away game.  Therefore Jaime demands that this final be played out on his own ground, in the tourney grounds outside King's Landing, according to the customs and traditions of Westeros.\r\n\r\nAnd should the wizards of Suvudu grant THAT request, he further demands that this be made a TRIAL OF SEVEN, to honor the Seven Gods.  His right to demand such a format is sanctified by ancient Westerosi custom... and my first Dunk & Egg story, \"The Hedge Knight.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the rules of a Trial of Seven, each combatant is allowed to have six companions to fight beside him.  Seven against seven.  Jaime's six will all be characters from the worlds and stories of George R.R. Martin (that would be me); Rand is free to fill out his six with characters from the works of Robert Jordan AND Brandon Sanderson.  (Yes, he can even include Conan, since Jordan wrote about him).\r\n\r\nSeven against seven.  For all the marbles.\r\n\r\nJaime's challenge.\r\n\r\nHow do the gods of Suvudu rule?","ditemid":144572,"eventtime":"2010-04-02 13:53:00","props":{"taglist":"general nonsense","current_moodid":45,"commentalter":1270333094,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":346,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"15:2,2:5,17:11,18:5,35:5,8:2,33:5,11:11,32:5,16:11,3:31,25:8,4:25,26:2,20:11,9:17,nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1270333065},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-04-02 19:53:28","anum":188,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/144572.html","event_timestamp":1270216380,"reply_count":96,"comments":[{"collapsed":1,"shown":0,"uname":"dodonovan","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dodonovan.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9555644,"talkid":37326,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/144572.html?thread=9555644#t9555644","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"7 years ago","poster":"grrm","massactions":0,"deleted":1,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dodonovan.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dodonovan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dodonovan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dodonovan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dodonovan","ctime_ts":1270238325,"leafclass":"deleted","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/536416/150218","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/144572.html?thread=9579196#t9579196","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/144572.html?thread=9579196#t9579196","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/144572.html?thread=9579196#t9579196","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"darmys","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://darmys.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9579196,"talkid":37418,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/144572.html?thread=9579196#t9579196","above":9555644,"upictitle":"Darmys: pic#536416","article":"I suspect that Kvothe could have beaten Rand.
