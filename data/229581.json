We'll also be glad to deface FORT FREAK and any other Wild Cards books you care to present to us.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dar46/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000dar46/s640x480\" width=\"317\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY JULY 24\r\n\r\n10:30 am - 11:30 am  WILD CARDS panel.

At Avatar, I'll be signing FEVRE DREAM, at IDW it will be DOORWAYS, for Tor WILD CARDS.  The place to get your DANCE WITH DRAGONS signed is at the big general signings on Friday and Saturday.  We've scheduled me for four hours of signing between those two days... so please, respect my other publishers and DO NOT ask me to sign your Ice & Fire books at the booth signings.  Those are meant to promote my other projects.\r\n\r\n[[AFTER THE CUT IS NSFW. ]]\r\n\r\n<lj-cut>\r\n\r\nOf course, there are certain things I am always willing to sign.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h40c0/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000h40c0\" width=\"503\" height=\"402\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<lj-cut>","ditemid":229581,"eventtime":"2011-07-19 16:19:00","props":{"current_location":"home... for now","taglist":"tor, idw, game of thrones, calendar, wild cards, appearances, conventions, a dance with dragons, signings, avatar, hbo","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1319227092,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":4,"revtime":1311661389},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-07-19 22:23:59","anum":205,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html","event_timestamp":1311092340,"reply_count":41,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14354381#t14354381","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14354381#t14354381","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14354381#t14354381","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tanatie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tanatie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14354381,"talkid":56071,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14354381#t14354381","upictitle":"tanatie: pic#0","article":"Someone better be recording that Game of Thrones panel.

Samwell is my favourite character. <br /><br />Usually, I am an intellectually engaged but emotionnally detached and critical reader - a valuable strategy that will help me finish my Ph.D.<br /><br />But it kind of dullens fiction for me.<br /><br />Your books have swept that away. They have completely captured my mind and my heart. A clean sweep. ASoIaF is my first fantasy read since the Earthsea Trilogy when I was 11. <br /><br />The Westeros experience is not like being a child again, and not escapist - it is like growing up to hard home truths. In Selhorys, Tyrion thinks: \"This is another world .. but not so different from the world I know\". Spot on.<br /><br />The Samwell thing: I gather women and men read books differently. At best, men can grow sensitive to symbols and metaphors. Women go right ahead and form personal relationships with characters.<br /><br />For the first time since accompanying Ged (when I was 11yrs old) or Raskolnikov (16), I have now (36) found a soulmate in this character. <br /><br />Jon takes no shit: he looks Sam straight in the eye and forbids him to be a coward; not on the inside, not on the outside. He sweeps aside the little neuroses and penetrates to the man inside. Sam has the brains and the character to be a maester of generational greatness. On page 319 of ADWD right now, can't wait to hear what happens next.<br /><br />Will Sam find peace in himself? Will he apply himself, develop his mind, and as a man, uncover the secret knowledge that saves Westeros from the white walkers? Your call I suppose :-)<br /><br />Have to wind up here - this is my first ever fan mail, won't get needy about wanting a reply, hope you can take this honest praise at face value. You have an amazing creative talent, an amazing knowledge of people, and one sick fucking sense of humour.<br /><br />Nice one.<br /><br />Best from Cologne (from a native of Dublin)<br /><br />Fergal<br /><br />I <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 20 2011, 10:35:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Never call yourself craven    SPOILER ALERT","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://samwelltarly.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"samwelltarly","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"samwelltarly","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://samwelltarly.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"samwelltarly","ctime_ts":1311158102,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367181#t14367181","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367181#t14367181","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367181#t14367181","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"chirop1","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://chirop1.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14367181,"talkid":56121,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367181#t14367181","upictitle":"chirop1: pic#72568140","article":"Is that a Mont Blanc you are signing that woman's chest with????","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"July 20 2011, 15:56:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://chirop1.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"chirop1","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"chirop1","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://chirop1.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"chirop1","ctime_ts":1311177405,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/108711406/35463646","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367693#t14367693","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367693#t14367693","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367693#t14367693","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_446260","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=638082340","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14367693,"talkid":56123,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/229581.html?thread=14367693#t14367693","upictitle":"Kevin Andrew Murphy: pic#108711406","article":"See you there!

I liked Sibel Kekili and Esme Bianco, not only because they are gorgeous, but their talent is quite apparent.
