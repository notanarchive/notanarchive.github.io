So long as Woody Johnson owns the team, the toxic environment will persist.  His history will lead to the top GM candidates passing on the gig, which in turn will make it hard for coaches and quarterbacks to thrive.

Billy B was a bit slow on the uptake defensively, as far as personel goes.  One might have even called the man stubborn, but he did finally come around and start drafting players that were quickier and more classically athletic rather than the vince wilforks of the world. He adapted to the rules changes over time and put more emphasis on the skills that take advantage of those rules changes.  Granted, he has been pretty horrendeous at drafting anyone that plays on the outside of the field. <br /><br />Rex is still trying to win games the way his dad wanted to win (damn near 30 years ago)....Ground and pound on offense and play tough nosed defense.  You can not win (at least not in the regular season) with a run-first offense anymore.  Say what you will about Idzik, but I think you might be a bit naive in thinking Rex didn't have a significant say in the QB's that were drafted (the Sanchize for sure). <br /><br />The Jets have shown nothing on Offense for his entire tenure, and been in the bottom third statistically (even in the \"good\" years).  Rex gets guys to play hard for him, but he doesn't exemplify the steadiness that is needed to show a QB how to lead a team.<br /><br />He very may well end up on a team with an established QB that just needs someone to come in and be a glorified defensive coordinator (Atlanta???) and win some games, but it wont last.  It will never last with him.  Players' coaches never work out in the long run.

Might be BS, but it seems odd for someone to voluntarily leave an NFL coaching job without another lined up.  He spent some time earlier in his career in the Jets organization, and apparently has some ties.  <br /><br />I have mixed feelings about him.  He definitely turned the Orange around, but he left for the NFL after saying for years that the SU job was his 'dream'.  I guess if I'm pissed by that - it means he's good at what he does.  He did some good things with the Bills - given he didn't have a QB.  Sounds familar.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe he'll trade for Ryan Nassib?
