{"itemid":1887,"subject":"Draft Week","event":"Okay, this is amusing.  What would it look like if NFL teams drafted characters from GAME OF THRONES?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nfl.com/photoessays/0ap3000000654646/season-6-game-of-thrones-mock-draft\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the <i><b>real</b></i> NFL is less than a week off, and as usual mock drafts are everywhere.\r\n\r\nI don't do mocks, but I do have my wishlist.  The Giants are drafting tenth, and boy, do they have a lot of needs.   I am still reeling at how bad their defense was last year.  Historically, in good years or bad years, the G-Men have always had a fearsome D, and they need to get back to that.  They spent a fortune in free agency to bolster the defense, and with luck some of those players should have a difference... but given the way injuries always seem to decimate Big Blue, drafting for more D would make a lot of sense.  The biggest need is for a top pass rusher.  We still don't know if JPP will ever be the same player he was before he blew off half his hand, and even if he is, he needs help on the other side.  Joey Bosa or Shaq Lawson would make me very happy in round one, if either one should last till number ten.   That being said, there's also a chance Ezekial Elliott will be there as well, and if he is, I hope the Giants grab him.   I love old smashmouth football, and the key to that is a bruising running game.  Elliott looks as though he could be special.\r\n\r\nAs for the Jets, who knows?   They draft considerably later.  Some mocks have them taking a QB, but I don't know... the two top QB prospects will be coming off the board 1/2 this year, looks like, and I don't think anyone else is worth a first round pick.   I am still hoping Gang Green can resign Fitz, to be sure, but if not, well, the Jets took Bryce Petty last year, I'd sooner they give him a chance rather than start over with someone new.  Not that I have a vote.  But if I did, I'd say the Jets should draft for defense as well.  You can never have too many pass rushers, especially when you're in the same division as Tom Brady.","ditemid":483303,"eventtime":"2016-04-23 18:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"amused","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Apr 24 00:59:27 2016]R [Sun Apr 24 00:59:29 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/724040028247089153 ","current_moodid":44,"commentalter":1461961055,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/724040028247089153","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.672038074600749]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1461459607}","revtime":1461961750},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-24 00:59:27","anum":231,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html","event_timestamp":1461437940,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126098021/77825696","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24255463#t24255463","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24255463#t24255463","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24255463#t24255463","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3622758","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10207733077702321/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24255463,"talkid":94747,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24255463#t24255463","upictitle":"Matthew Ungar: pic#126098021","article":"Sports Illustrated put out a similar list.

I'm not sure how it works, but I think you draft or order characters and get points based on certain things like violence and sex. <br /><br />I agree with your defensive picks George but I disagree on running back. Not a big fan of taking a RB in the early rounds, most of the time it seems like you can get one in the later rounds or as a rookie free agent. Though honestly with Reese, I don't think we'll end up getting anything of substantive value at any position in the later rounds (I'm talking round 2 or greater). I just hope he doesn't follow a trend in the NFL of the past couple of years of GMs who are on the hot seat that mortgage the future and trade future early round picks for a player in the current draft.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 24 2016, 04:20:13 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/OberynMattell","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"OberynMattell","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2738803","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72071300&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"April 24 2016, 06:05:49 UTC","dname":"OberynMattell","ctime_ts":1461471613,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123123203/69878724","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24257767#t24257767","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24257767#t24257767","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24257767#t24257767","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"wergiforce","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://wergiforce.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24257767,"talkid":94756,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24257767#t24257767","upictitle":"wergiforce: Default","article":"Got excited for a second thinking 'Draft' referred to a book draft. <br />Sorry, neither American nor into ball sports, I'll shut up and get back in my hole...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 24 2016, 12:15:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wergiforce.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wergiforce","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wergiforce","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wergiforce.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wergiforce","ctime_ts":1461500143,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93386974/1367601","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258023#t24258023","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258023#t24258023","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258023#t24258023","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hominysnark","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hominysnark.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24258023,"talkid":94757,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258023#t24258023","upictitle":"HominySnark: pic#93386974","article":"\"Jamie's the perfect choice to lend JPP a hand.\" <br /><br />*dies laughing*","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 24 2016, 13:16:35 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hominysnark.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hominysnark","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hominysnark","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hominysnark.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hominysnark","ctime_ts":1461503795,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/20286577/2674896","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258279#t24258279","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258279#t24258279","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258279#t24258279","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vandor","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vandor.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24258279,"talkid":94758,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/483303.html?thread=24258279#t24258279","upictitle":"Nick: pic#20286577","article":"And based off the NFL.com list I'm going to guess that the Patriots will trade up early into the second round and draft Littlefinger.
