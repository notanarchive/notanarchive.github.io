Congratulation! I'm sure your mother would be bursting out of pride :)<br /><br />I wanted to let you know that I was really moved about the passage where you talked about redemption. We judge so quickly nowadays and hold on to grudges with an energy we can't seem to summon up for much else.  I don't have any problems with your characters. That's practically why I read those books. I'm happy getting into the head of those complex characters and love the greyest to pieces but it's different and so much harder to try and forgive in real life. Especially with people who are naturally close to you. The things you said made me really question myself and my behavior towards people I have huge issues with. I'm pretty sure I can't let go of all the anger over night but I really should be able to try here and there when at the same time I have a huge place in my heart for a (fictional) man who pushed a little boy out of the window. <br /><br />I'm really glad that you are on this earth and were given a public voice!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"April 24 2014, 19:06:37 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hummelchen3.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hummelchen3","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hummelchen3","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hummelchen3.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hummelchen3","ctime_ts":1398366397,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122098640/13353665","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368184.html?thread=19043128#t19043128","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368184.html?thread=19043128#t19043128","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368184.html?thread=19043128#t19043128","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sistercrow","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sistercrow.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19043128,"talkid":74387,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/368184.html?thread=19043128#t19043128","upictitle":"sistercrow: Black cat eyes","article":"Congrats, George!
