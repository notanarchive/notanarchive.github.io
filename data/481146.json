I've been to Rio, my head trainer is from there and I've went with him a couple times. I won't nitpick, and I know this sounds insane, but Tiago is living pretty good for being in a favela. He has shoes (my trainer got the first pair he didn't have to share with his siblings at 14), seems he ate cassava cakes, and even has a Swiss Army Knife. I know he recovered these from a landfill, but that kind of \"luxury\" might get you mugged (or much worse) in a slum in Rio. <br /><br />Still, not many stories set in a favela so it was a nice change. He really nailed it with the drug trafficking and some of the other major issues of the people that have to live around that stuff. Overall, he made the setting realistic even if a few details are off. I forwarded it to my coach, Jorge. A superhero from the favela. He's a comic fan so he should love it. <br /><br />Thanks for sharing, George. I'm about to go check out that Daniel Abraham story. I loved Flat Diane so anything by him is always a treat.
