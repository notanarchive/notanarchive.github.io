{"itemid":491,"subject":"Wild Card Weekend","event":"Wild Card Weekend is almost upon us.  No, I'm not talking about SUICIDE KINGS this time -- although this weekend would be a great opportunity to go out and buy it -- but about the NFL.\r\n\r\nThe Giants are out, but the Jets are still in it (it's good to have two teams), travelling to Cincinnati for a rematch with the Bengals.  Needless to say, I'll be pulling hard for this game to turn out the same way as the last one.  Cincy will be playing all their starters this time, so I expect the game will be closer, but I do think the Jets have an excellent chance of winning again and advancing to the next round.  Let's Go Jets!\r\n\r\nThat's the game that matters most to me, of course... but it's no fun watching a football game unless you care about the outcome, so I'll be rooting for certain teams and against others in the other three wild card games as well.\r\n\r\nI hate Evil Little Bill, so of course I will be cheering for the Ravens to upset the Patriots and eliminate them from this year's tournament.  I have mixed feelings about the Ravens themselves.  I don't much like Ray Lewis, but I've always been fond of Bawlmer, and of course I am an Edgar Allen Poe fan.  But I'd cheer for almost anyone against the Vile BB.\r\n\r\nI also hate the Philadelphia Eagles, but not as much as I hate the Dallas Cowboys, so I guess I have to cheer on Donovan McNabb and company.  If the Cowboys get eliminated, extending their long drought of playoff victories, Jerry Jones will probably fire Wade Phillips and the Cowboys will start all over with a new coach, which always causes a certain amount of chaos.\r\n\r\nSo here's hoping the Eagles win.  (Then next week I can cheer for someone else to beat them).\r\n\r\nIn the Arizona - Green Bay game, my feelings are mixed.  I think Green Bay treated Brett Favre shabbily; but then, I'm more a \"loyalty\" guy than one of those \"it's a business\" guys.  On the other hand, I love the Green Bay fans, the history and tradition, and the fact that the team is publically owned, rather than being the personal plaything of some asswipe billionaire like Jerry Jones.  (More teams should be publically owned).  On the Cardinals side, I like Kurt Warner, who was a class act when he was with the Giants, as a mentor to Eli.  But I don't like the Bidwells, or the fact that the Cardinals still refuse to give up the championship they stole from the Pottsville Maroons.  Tough call... but Pottsville takes it.  May the curse endure.

The media constantly portrays Favre as the wronged party, but that is definitely not the case, and I am sick of hearing it.  For years he waffled about whether he would retire, very publicly, every spring.  Then he did retire, and the Packers understandably moved on to Aaron Rodgers.  When Favre kind of thought he would come out of retirement in May, the Packers reluctantly said OK.  But, then he decided to stay retired after all.  By the time he had unretired at last, Rodgers was in charge of the team, and they had drafted 2 quarterbacks.  <br /><br />I don't have anything against Favre for wanting to play again, and I can understand why he would have second thoughts about retiring.  That being said, what other job can you retire and come back 4 months later and demand they reassign the person who has replaced you?  You say the Packers should have had some loyalty to Favre, but what about its responsibility to Aaron Rodgers, who had been handed the starting quarterback job when Favre retired?  Benching him because Favre, on third thought (yes, not second thought, but third thought), wanted to play after all would have been reprehensible.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"January 8 2010, 02:28:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://prusti.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"prusti","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"prusti","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://prusti.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"prusti","ctime_ts":1262917721,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/47062382/10372712","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125734.html?replyto=8257574","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125734.html?thread=8257574#t8257574","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125734.html?thread=8257574#t8257574","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125734.html?thread=8257574#t8257574","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"pyrrhus_crowned","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://pyrrhus-crowned.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8257574,"talkid":32256,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/125734.html?thread=8257574#t8257574","above":8250150,"upictitle":"pyrrhus_crowned: pic#47062382","article":"As a fellow Wisconsinite, I absolutely agree with your assessment.

I think the thing that really chapped Bret was when they told him he'd have to come back as the back-up QB to Rodgers. Bret's problem is that he doesn't want to go out with an ounce of gas left in the tank and there's no chance he's going to play second fiddle to anyone.  Rodgers has turned out to be a great QB after some awful growing pains last year.  I think both sides were half right.

You must because they are the ONLY publicly owned team and every other team out there is owned by an asswipe Billionaire.  Yes, as I am sure you are already well aware, even the Jets are owned by an Asswipe Billionaire, heir to the Johnson and Johnson fortune.  The difference between Jerry and Mr. Johnson?  Jerry made his money.  He was neither a Billionaire nor a millionaire when he popped out of the womb. After Jerry bought the Cowboys, he parlayed that into becoming a Billionaire.  He is by far the best Businessman/Owner in the NFL and is one of the reasons the Cowboys Frachise is the most popular Footbal Franchise on the planet.  This is a pretty good accomplishment considering the local Metro size of Dallas vs. New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. Add the fact that Dallas has not won a play-off game in 14 years and it is pretty amazing. Every year Dallas beats teams like Giants in Merchandise sales.  Some years doubling the next closest rival.  Hmmm...

To be playing in January is pretty shocking for me.  To have beaten the Eagles both times this year is great, though now there's the hurdle of being able to beat a team 3 times in one year statistic.  Not good.<br /><br />But yeah, a Cowboys loss tomorrow may be potentially fatal to Wade's career (whether pro football or just with Cowboys is another question).  I still don't like Romo though, and I think he should be on the chopping block as well as Wade since he's probably even more responsible for Dallas' woes.  The Cowboys have suffered most of this season thanks to his poor, under-achieving, performances for a $65 million contract.  Maybe getting canned will finally wipe that smile off his face after playing worse than a rookie most of the season.  So yeah, lose and Wade needs to be replaced, but so does Romo!

He had his fewest number of fumbles with 6 for the season (4 were lost).  He had 26 touchdowns tied for second, and a 97.6 passer rating.  The only statistic this year that was bad for him was sacks with 34.  So he had a total of 13 turnovers. <br /><br />Breaking down game wise, he had one really terrible game with 3 interceptions against the Giants the first time they played.  Another terrible game of under 200 yards against Washington that they won.  He had six interceptions spread out throughout the season (only one a game) other than that game.<br /><br />He had eight 300 yard games.  Six other games of 250 yards or more.<br /><br />Looking at stats, he's had two crappy games this year, one of which the Cowboys won.  <br /><br />In the five games they lost, the Cowboys worse margin of defeat was 10 points.  <br /><br />Some of that can be attributed to outstanding defense (Wade is running that by the way), but you have to give credit to Romo for not making many mistakes this year.<br /><br />Now all of that is moot if Romo crashes and burns on Saturday. Then, everyone will compare him to Danny White (who lost 3 NFC championships but had a .500 playoff record).  <br /><br />I might remind you that Peyton Manning played I believe eight seasons before he won a Super Bowl and yet everyone is putting him in the Hall of Fame and his career isn't over yet.  <br /><br />Needless to say, I will not be rooting for Philly on Saturday, I've been a fan of Dallas since the 70's.<br /><br />If I could get rid of anyone, it would be Jerry as the general manager (Firing Tom Laundry in a humiliating manner, not sucking up to Jimmy to keep him around and possibly get 4 Super Bowls, hiring Barry, drafting Quincy Carter (see we could have the dope smoking marginal quarter back instead of Romo), and the list goes on and on.  <br /><br />As for Wade, I really think his job does hinge on this game.  If he can fight through adversity after two disappointing seasons and take the Pokes to the Super Bowl, then he deserves to keep the job.  If he wins two games, I'd say he keeps the job, but if he loses tomorrow or after only winning one.  Yeah, send him packing and beg Cowher to be the coach.  <br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","below":8270118,"ctime":"January 8 2010, 20:22:07
