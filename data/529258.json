{"itemid":2067,"subject":"The Martians Have Landed","event":"Well, not really.  But our friend Andy Weir did drop by this afternoon for lunch.  And Andy, as you all know, is the author of THE MARTIAN.  Andy is in the Land of Enchantment overseeing the filming of the pilot episode of MISSION CONTROL, his new series for CBS.  Melinda Snodgrass and I had the opportunity to visit the set last week, and I have to say, it's looking great.  \r\n\r\nOf course, we couldn't let Andy escape our clutches without making him autograph some books.  He was kind enough to sit down and scribble his name on forty hardcover copies of THE MARTIAN... which we can now offer for sale through the JCC website, while the supply lasts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/442652/442652_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/445416/445416_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nIf you want one, move soon... last time Andy came by, we sold out all the autographed copies in a few weeks.  It's first come, first served, as ever.\r\n\r\nThe Jean Cocteau has all sorts of other signed books for sale as well, for all the autograph hounds out there.   Here are a few of them.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/443090/443090_300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/443324/443324_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/443638/443638_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/443831/443831_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/444141/444141_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/444220/444220_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/444503/444503_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/444688/444688_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/445055/445055_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n(And yes, we have a bunch of signed books by the Martin guy as well).\r\n\r\nHappy reading.","ditemid":529258,"eventtime":"2017-03-26 18:18:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema bookstore, television, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Mar 27 00:18:50 2017]R [Mon Mar 27 00:18:51 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/846154513199321088 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1490910035,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/846154513199321088","picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.710796459091073]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1490573960}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2067?v=1490910069","revtime":1490910068},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-03-27 00:18:47","anum":106,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html","event_timestamp":1490552280,"reply_count":15,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125731010/74682138","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906282#t25906282","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906282#t25906282","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906282#t25906282","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"falcon2908","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://falcon2908.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25906282,"talkid":101196,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906282#t25906282","upictitle":"falcon2908: pic#125731010","article":"Speaking of SciFi, what is your opinion on The Expanse TV series?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 month ago","ctime":"March 27 2017, 05:24:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"SciFi","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://falcon2908.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"falcon2908","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"falcon2908","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://falcon2908.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"falcon2908","ctime_ts":1490592282,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906794#t25906794","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906794#t25906794","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906794#t25906794","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25906794,"talkid":101198,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25906794#t25906794","above":25906282,"upictitle":"George R.R.

That would allow Mike to take the pilot to another network and, we hope, set it up.  (It's a fun script, and we're proud of it).  I will remain exclusive to HBO for television, however, so if the show does go somewhere else, Michael Cassutt will go with it, but I won't.<br /><br />Which is okay.  I have lots of other stuff in development at HBO.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 month ago","ctime":"March 28 2017, 18:39:41 UTC","parent":25909354,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1490726381,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126978924/80277979","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25910378#t25910378","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25910378#t25910378","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25910378#t25910378","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"onofriog","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://onofriog.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25910378,"talkid":101212,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/529258.html?thread=25910378#t25910378","above":25910122,"upictitle":"onofriog: pic#126978924","article":"Thank you, George for replying to my message. I asked because of two reasons: 1) Everyone's always bugging you of when the next book in the ASOIAF series is coming out (which btw I can't wait and I'm patiently waiting) so at least let me be the one person that doesn't. 2) because I am pursuing acting and would love to try to audition for the show whenever the time came. This probably sounds crazy but I thought I'd give it a shot by asking about the show to see what's been happening with the project since it was first announced. Lastly,are there any plans of coming back to Staten Island for another Direwolf game? I apologize if I am asking too much or bothering you I know you're a busy person and i don't want be in your way.

Whatever the case may be, it's exciting to know that more of your work will be coming to HBO.  Has anyone ever pitched an animated series for some part of the ASOIAF universe?  I know how well it's worked for Star Wars with the Clone Wars and Rebels, and an adult animated Song program - say of something that would be otherwise cost prohibitive due to CGI costs (Dance), IMO would be something that would really work as an alternate method of bringing some stories to the small screen.<br /><br />Also, have you watched Iron Fist yet as well?  I too am a big fan of all the Netflix/Marvel productions, fantastic work, it still spins my head when I think back to 2010/11 when Netflix used to send me DVDs in the mail - how quickly they became a production company in their own right, next rung down the ladder from the mighty HBO IMO.
