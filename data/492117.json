{"itemid":1922,"subject":"MAC Nattering","event":"Worldcon is coming up soon... MidAmericon II in Kansas City, Missouri, the long awaited successor to the original 1976 MidAmericon, which some of us old pharts still consider to be the Greatest Worldcon Evah.   (It was certainly the most innovative, a true game-changer, for both good and ill).\r\n\r\nI will be there, along with hundreds of other writers, artists, and editors, and thousands of fans.  If you have never been to a con before, this is the one to go to... assuming you're a reader.  Worldcon has always had a strong literary slant, and while costuming, television, films, comics, and games are all included as well, it is the written word that occupies center ring here.\r\n\r\nIf that interests you, you can join here: http://midamericon2.org/\r\n\r\nJoin now, and you'll be able to vote for the Hugo Awards (and to nominate next year).\r\n\r\nFor readers who would like to meet and talk with their favorite writers (including me), a worldcon is a MUCH better place to do so than a booksigning.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, however, there are also booksignings <i><b>AT</b></i> worldcon, so you'll have plenty of opportunity to get your books scrawled in, be they rare limited editions or battered paperbacks.  I have committed to four (count 'em, 4) booksignings at MAC myself:\r\n\r\n       -- I'll be doing two ninety-minute signings in the convention autograph area, signing whatever you want me to sign, be it books, comics, swords, games, Funko Pop dolls, t-shirts, or body parts, (but only one item per person, please, and no personalizations or inscriptions, sorry),\r\n        \r\n-- I will also be doing a one-hour signing in the dealer's room at Gary Gianni's booth, but at that one Gary and I will be signing ONLY copies of A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS, and the new Gianni sketchbook that GG will be debuting at MAC,\r\n\r\n        -- and in conjunction with Tor Books and a local bookstore, I'll be part of a huge WILD CARDS signing, joined by more than a dozen other Wild Cards authors new and old.  My \"no personal inscription\" rule will still hold for that one, alas, though many of the other writers <i><b>will</b></i> inscribe.  However, I am suspending my \"only one book per person\" rule for this event.   I'll sign as many books as you want here... so long as they are all Wild Cards books.\r\n\r\nDates, times, and locations will all be forthcoming, so watch this space.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, of course, I'll be doing other stuff in Kansas City as well.   A couple of panels, a reading, maybe some other stuff.   \r\n\r\nSee you at Big MAC!  And save me some burnt ends!!!","ditemid":492117,"eventtime":"2016-07-13 11:48:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"wild cards, worldcon, signings, signed books","crosspost_tw_log":"[Wed Jun 29 17:48:22 2016]R [Wed Jun 29 17:48:23 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/748211524464893953 ","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1468046226,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/748211524464893953","picture_keyword":"tux","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.579481944753752]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1467222508}","revtime":1468870760},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-06-29 17:48:20","anum":85,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492117.html","event_timestamp":1468410480,"reply_count":90,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492117.html?thread=24706901#t24706901","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492117.html?thread=24706901#t24706901","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492117.html?thread=24706901#t24706901","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3725589","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/114751162534053546953","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24706901,"talkid":96511,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/492117.html?thread=24706901#t24706901","upictitle":"Pedro Nascimento: pic#0","article":"Sadly I will be on the other side of the pond, I'm sure it will be a great time GRRM!
