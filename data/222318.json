{"itemid":868,"subject":"Back to Warsaw","event":"The morning after.  Still recovering from last night's signing at Posnan, which was massive.  The line went up the stairs and out the door, and at times I thought it would never end.  The last folks in the queue must have waited three and a half hours.  Sorry if I seemed half dead by the time you reached me.  It was mostly because I WAS half dead.\r\n\r\nIf you missed the signing, well, I signed a few boxes of hardcovers for the Zysk bookstore just off the Old Market Square, so you still may be able to snag one if you get there soon.\r\n\r\nThings are better on the tech front.  Email working again, thank god.  Cell phone too... at least till I burned up all the minutes, which seemed to take all of half of a call.  But I feel back in the world again.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours we will be hitting the road for a return to Warsaw.  No more public events there, just a dinner with my agents.  Then it's off to Slovenia.","ditemid":222318,"eventtime":"2011-06-20 23:40:00","props":{"taglist":"travels, signings","current_moodid":14,"commentalter":1308809948,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1309190797},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-06-21 05:40:26","anum":110,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html","event_timestamp":1308613200,"reply_count":25,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/40031683/946263","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13861742#t13861742","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13861742#t13861742","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13861742#t13861742","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"duckygirlrocks","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://duckygirlrocks.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13861742,"talkid":54147,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13861742#t13861742","upictitle":"duckygirl: jabdragon","article":"Wow, sounds rough!

Yesterday, I believe, I saw one. Hundreds of people, thousands of books and so little time…<br /><br />I think that simple \"thanks\" won't do... why? All that warm heart, dedication, even heroism (if you consider thousands signatures and autographs given in that almost airless room… especially after long journey to us). So here's my story:<br /><br />Organization wasn’t flawless. But thanks to that I was truly grateful for opportunity of taking pictures with you. Until last minutes I wasn’t sure if that even will be possible. I waited for three hours (and i was one and half before scheduled 17:00) but it was truly great experience. Especially when we see how hard you worked. I can only write here that not a single person complained and G.R.R. Martin was more than generous with his time and heart.<br /><br />I can’t get those people who wrote that they were “to far” to reach G.R.R. Martin (I'll mention your name for some keywords;)). To far from Poznan/Nidzica/Warsaw is Kazachstan, China and Australia. I took a day off in work and traveled by train as many others just to stand in that queue. Why? To maybe caught a glimpse of him. Maybe (if I'll be lucky) get one sign or two. Of course that I had with me everything I could (board game, cards, books (including four anthologies). Of course I’ve got backup camera with backup batteries and backup memory cards even though I thought that I won’t see him. I can’t understand why I won’t do this for one of my favourite authors. I’ve got to traveled only 60 miles by LAND (railway to be precise) and 60 is not a 6000 (how Pitagoras of me ;)) by plane with troubles and adventures. My thought is: if someone can save me couple days and thousands of polish zlotys and is willing to take effort and fly to me… well, that person is certainly worth admiration plus every polish zloty I spend on travel and books.<br /><br />When I saw rose placed on a table next to G.R.R. Martin hand (miraculously (still after those autopgraphs) writing one!) I only regret one thing… That I didn’t make something to show my gratitude (and I really could do some pirography or caligraphed acrostych).<br /><br />We thank you for your kindness. We thank you for your time and appreciate each and every second of it! Long live G.R.R. Martin! Long live the king!<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 21 2011, 09:12:40 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Grateful for your greatness","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://j-dyrda.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"j_dyrda","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"j_dyrda","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://j-dyrda.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"j_dyrda","ctime_ts":1308647560,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/64969269/11184186","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13863790#t13863790","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13863790#t13863790","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13863790#t13863790","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ngc7023","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ngc7023.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13863790,"talkid":54155,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13863790#t13863790","upictitle":"Be M.P.: eye","article":"Will you be coming to Serbia, perhaps?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"June 21 2011, 09:53:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://ngc7023.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ngc7023","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ngc7023","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://ngc7023.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"ngc7023","ctime_ts":1308649999,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110528512/38037076","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13864046#t13864046","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13864046#t13864046","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13864046#t13864046","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_560006","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002072235715","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13864046,"talkid":54156,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/222318.html?thread=13864046#t13864046","upictitle":"Martin Vavpotič: pic#110528512","article":"Looking forward to meeting you in Slovenia, George.
