{"itemid":203,"subject":"Win One, Lose One","event":"A strong, convincing win by the Giants today.  Of course, it was against the Rams, and the Rams look truly pathetic so far this year.  But then again, I thought the Skins looked wretched last week against the G-Men and this week they managed to upset the Saints, one of the trendy picks for this year's NFC title... so maybe it's the Giants making these other teams look bad, at least in part.  Anyway, Eli Manning looked very sharp, the defense stuffed the run again and harassed the qb as if Strahan and Osi were still on the field (Justin Tuck looked awesome), and the three-headed running tandem of Jacobs, Ward, and Bradshaw is a real beast.  So it's 2-0, and next week the Bengals come to town.  So far, so good.\r\n\r\nThe Jets game, on the other hand... sigh....\r\n\r\nEven without Brady, the Patriots still seem to have our number.  As Tom Jackson said in the postgame commentary on ESPN, \"if not now, when?\"  I have to wonder.  \r\n\r\nI blame the playcalling, at least in part.  They're not letting Favre be Favre.  Too much playing close to the vest, playing not to lose.  Against the Patriots, you can't set up the pass by establishing a running game.  The Jets should know that by now.  Against the Patriots, you need to set up the running game with the pass, by stretching the field.  And they should have gone after Cassel much more aggressively.\r\n\r\nIt was especially disheartening watching Lamont Jordan gash the Jets with one strong run after another, exactly the way he used to gash other teams when he was Curtis Martin's backup on the Jets.  I always liked Lamont, and was sorry when the Jets lost him.  I hate to see him in a Patriots uniform.\r\n\r\nSo... win one, lose one.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the Jets and Giants, there were some incredible games in the NFL this weekend.  I've got to say, I'm glad I'm not a San Diego Chargers fan.  Losing is one thing.  Losing the way the Chargers lost these past two weeks would kill me.  I thought the end of the Panthers game was amazing, but the finish of the Broncos game... aaargh...\r\n\r\nAnd next week the Jets have to go to San Diego, where the Chargers will either be (1) reeling or (2) really fired up.

Yes, now the Patriots do have an incredibly talented team, but don't use that as a way to discredit Brady for being one of the best quarterbacks in the game today.  I doubt we're going to have any issues of the Pats running up the score this year.  Why?  Because they don't have Brady, plain and simple.  If anything, the Giants are going to be that team this year, especially if they keep playing the way they're playing right now and Eli keeps improving his game.

The Patriots secondary is questionable to say the least. They get good pressure on the QB so you can't really do those 80 yard plays but you can easily take them out between 20-30 yard throws. At which point they will either expose themselves to long plays or the run. <br /><br />I watched it and seriously doubted that \"Man-genius\" epitaph that the Jets Head Coach had. To be honest If you could manage good blocking I don't think the Secondary can stand up to the long plays either.

Then the DC team disproved that opinion. I was extremely pleased with Eli. Not only has he shown his 'intangible' factor, but also sound QB play. I don't expect him to become Dan Marino or Joe Montana. However, my eyes have been opened and I can now see why Ernie picked him in the manner he did. Also, kudos to the staff and the team for helping him weather us fickle and overbearing NY fans and media.<br /><br />I generally don't look at the Jets. Yesterday I did. Hmmmm. I guess you can say they aren't letting Brett be Brett but as I see it he's to old to be that Brett. Don't misunderstand. He's still an exceptional QB, but with this O line we can probably expect a lot of interceptions in the second half of games. Brett looked tired to me even if Phil Simms didn't think so. They would have had a better shot at the victory if they had even a mediocre performance by their special teams.<br /><br />As for the Chargers... couldn't have happened to a more deserving owner and front staff. How could anyone be so daft as to firer a staff who won 13 games and hire a joke. That said, I feel for their fans.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"September 15 2008, 22:06:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1221516415,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/66929769/13898352","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/52123.html?replyto=4209051","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/52123.html?thread=4209051#t4209051","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/52123.html?thread=4209051#t4209051","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/52123.html?thread=4209051#t4209051","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ser_steveo","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ser-steveo.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4209051,"talkid":16441,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/52123.html?thread=4209051#t4209051","upictitle":"ser_steveo: chargers","article":"This defense is absolutely MISERABLE right now under the direction of defensive coordinator Ted\"no qb pressure\"Cotrell.

I believe in these guys and I think that they will come out of the gates next Monday and go on a tear throughout the rest of the season just beating everyone else to pieces.

I know Merriman is gone but Cromartie and company have a lot of fixing to get done and quick.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"September 16 2008, 20:47:01 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"NFL","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://shadowmine.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"shadowmine","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"shadowmine","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://shadowmine.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"shadowmine","ctime_ts":1221598021,"tracked":0}]}
