{"itemid":1447,"subject":"The 6th Gun Returns to Santa Fe","event":"<span style=\"font-size:1.4em;\">THE SIXTH GUN</span> is a exceedingly popular Fantasy Western series that&#39;s been burning up the comic shops the past few years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zombies and gunslingers, hard to beat that.&nbsp; Given the popularity of the comic, no one was surprised when&nbsp; NBC picked up the television rights to the series and filmed a one-hour pilot, shooting most of it on one of the many &quot;old west town&quot; sets that surround Santa Fe.&nbsp; But everyone was surprised when NBC passed on the pilot rather than go to series.\r\n\r\nTurns out that was good news for GAME OF THRONES, since we promptly made off with two of SIXTH GUN&#39;s stars, Pedro Pascal (who became Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper of Dorne) and Michiel Huisman (our new Daario Naharis).&nbsp; It was less good for all the other folks on SIXTH GUN, whose work would never be seen.\r\n\r\nBut now it will... on Friday, May 23 the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe will be showing the pilot of THE SIXTH GUN... the first and, quite likely, last time the pilot will be shown, and beyond a doubt the ONLY time you will ever get to see it on a big (okay, medium sized) screen.&nbsp; It&#39;s an event that comic fans. fantasy fans. western fans, and zombie fans will not want to miss.\r\n\r\nFor those who don&#39;t know the comic, here&#39;s a taste:\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"441\" />\r\n\r\n(FYI, it should be noted that the pilot is live action, not animated, the above shots all come from the comic).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;We are planning a whole day of activities around THE SIXTH GUN.&nbsp; We will have two showings of the pilot, one at 4:00 pm and one at 8:30 pm.&nbsp; In between we will have gunfights, zombie shambles, zombie dance hall girls.&nbsp; Some local members of the cast and crew should turn up (the first time they&#39;ve had a chance to see the fruit of their labors).&nbsp; Our bar will be serving a special cocktail, the Sinclair Shooter.\r\n\r\nAnd we will have three very special guests:&nbsp; writer <span style=\"font-size:1.4em;\">CULLEN BUNN</span> and artist <span style=\"font-size:1.4em;\">BRIAN HURTT</span>, the guys behind the SIXTH GUN comic, will be flying into Santa Fe to join us, together with <span style=\"font-size:1.4em;\">RYAN CONDAL</span>, scriptwriter and executive producer for the television pilot.&nbsp; Cullen and Brian will be autographing copies of the comic and graphic novels, and joining Ryan for a panel discussion and Q&amp;A about the comic, the TV show, and the future of the series.\r\n\r\nThe best part?&nbsp; All of this is <span style=\"font-size:1.4em;\">FREE.&nbsp; </span>No charge for admission to either of the screenings, the panel, any of it.\r\n\r\nAnd if you get to the Cocteau by noon, we may even make a zombie of you.&nbsp; The more zombie gunslingers and zombie dance hall girls we have on hand, the more fun it will be.&nbsp; It takes a lot of zombies to make a proper horde...\r\n\r\nSee you at the shootout.&nbsp; May 23.&nbsp; Remember that date.","ditemid":370555,"eventtime":"2014-05-10 14:29:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, graphic novels, television, comic books","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1400944697,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":3,"interface":"web","revtime":1400944832},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-05-07 20:29:18","anum":123,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html","event_timestamp":1399732140,"reply_count":13,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122815289/69026770","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19086715#t19086715","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19086715#t19086715","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19086715#t19086715","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2437620","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/SmartDavid","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19086715,"talkid":74557,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19086715#t19086715","upictitle":"David Smart: pic#122815289","article":"Since NBC turned down a series run, can another network take on this series (maybe HBO or Showtime for example)?

In my work as a wikia admin for Game of Thrones, I have met a fair number of faithful readers, editors, and even admins who would include themselves in the number of the Bronies. Now to define the term, a \"Brony\" is a male, generally 18-38 years in age, who is a fan of Lauren Faust's My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic animated series.<br /><br />An excellent primer for this phenomenon is the documentary, Bronies, which I was instrumental in creating and bringing to the mainstream. It is also narrated and hosted by John DeLancie, who needs no introduction.<br /><br />I have heard tell that Ran dabbles in Bronyism, and I've been trying to get Wert to come out of the Brony closet for some time now.<br /><br />Finally, for absolute clarification, Brony/Only is a core group of fans who are the most faithful: \"the true fans,\" if I may. We are the ones who attend every Bronycon and smaller event, go to all the signings, and are 100# committed to evangelizing Ms. Faust's earlier, more obscure works.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","below":19146107,"ctime":"May 21 2014, 13:49:03 UTC","parent":19139451,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thedragondemand.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thedragondemand","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thedragondemand","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thedragondemand.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thedragondemand","ctime_ts":1400680143,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19146107#t19146107","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19146107#t19146107","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19146107#t19146107","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2594083","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/112125894329852518436","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19146107,"talkid":74789,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19146107#t19146107","above":19145595,"upictitle":"Dante Draven: pic#0","article":"bronies,its the adult(mainly male)fan base of the cartoon \"my little pony friendship is magic\"","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 21 2014, 17:44:41 UTC","parent":19139451,"massactions":0,"subject":"Nero","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/112125894329852518436","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Dante Draven","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2594083","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70944364&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Dante Draven","ctime_ts":1400694281,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19138427#t19138427","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19138427#t19138427","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19138427#t19138427","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_503871","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1510824785","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19138427,"talkid":74759,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/370555.html?thread=19138427#t19138427","upictitle":"Josemi de Alonso: pic#0","article":"You are doing something really cool!

Every month I went out and picked up the new issue, almost like clockwork. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Then they started releasing the comics sporadically instead of the monthly issues I was expecting, which wouldn't have been an issue except they weren't as good as they use to be.<br /><br /> I still faithfully bought every issue when they came out though and heard they were trying to turn it into a series! I was so excited. I thought it would be the motivation they needed to get back to the story. It sucks it didn't get picked up. It probably would have given them less time to work on their series, as I'm sure the show would entailed tons of conventions and traveling for them.
