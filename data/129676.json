Myself, I define Star Wars, Star Trek, and the like as \"franchised worlds\" or \"sharecropping.\"  These are cases where a studio owns all the underlying rights, and the writers are mere hirelings working on work-made-for-hire contracts and forbidden to change any of the fundamentals of the characters or universe... which of course limits the stories you can tell.<br /><br />A true shared world, like Wild Cards, is the joint creation of a group of writers, all of whom own some part of it.  In these cases the writer/creators all share in the earnings of the books and spinoffs, and also retain some control over their characters and creations.<br /><br />Shared worlds were most popular in the 80s.  Besides Wild Cards, other series include THIEVES WORLD, LIAVEK, HEROES IN HELL, THE FLEET, ITHKAR, MEROVINGIAN NIGHTS, WAR WORLD.  Charlie Grant had a horror shared world as well...
