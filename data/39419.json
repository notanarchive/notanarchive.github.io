I hope you listened.\r\n\r\nBill Schafer of SubPress has just informed me that FEVRE DREAM is now sold out.\r\n\r\nThey still have copies of their deluxe illustrated edition of HUNTER'S RUN, signed by all three authors, but those too are going fast.  If you want one, this would be a good time to visit the Subterranean website, before Ramon and Maneck follow Abner and Joshua down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00004ghw/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00004ghw/s320x240\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>","ditemid":39419,"eventtime":"2008-03-05 14:29:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":93,"opt_nocomments":1,"verticals_list":"life"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-03-05 21:35:00","anum":251,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/39419.html","event_timestamp":1204727340,"reply_count":0}
