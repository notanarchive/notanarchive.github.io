{"itemid":45,"subject":"Back to Pizza","event":"Our annual winter trip to Boskone and New York City is coming steadily closer, and with it the soon-to-be-infamous pizza crawl in New Haven.  Time to get organized.\r\n\r\nMy last post about this (two down, under the HBO news) drew a lot of comments.  Others responded by private email.  Sounds as though lots of folks want to be a part of our crawl, and try the famous slices of New Haven.\r\n\r\nHow many, though?  I'm not sure.  Some of those responding were interested but indefinite.  Others said, \"I'm in,\" but they were posting anonymously, so I have no idea WHO is \"in.\"  Others used their Live Journal handles and avatars... which is better than Anonymous, but in many cases I still don't know who you are.  Please, guys and gals, use your names, at least for this.  Otherwise we may end up with twenty people standing outside of Pepe's waiting for Billy the Mountain, none of them realizing that Billy the Mountain is really that quiet guy called Fred who turned up twenty minutes ago.\r\n\r\nWe do need to get a better notion of whether there are going to be ten of us, twenty, fifty, or a hundred (too many, I fear, and we may have logistical problems).\r\n\r\nWe could also use a volunteer on location in New Haven to help coordinate all this, someone to double check that all the pizza places are open, make reservations where reservations are accepted, and generally get our ducks in a row.  \r\n\r\nSo let's make it official now.  Who's in?  Not maybe, or I'd love to, or I'd-be-in-except-I-live-in-Istanbul, but definitely going-to-be-there-on-February-20 in.  And is there anyone there local who can take charge of organizing some of this?\r\n\r\nI'll start.  Parris and I are in.  That's 2.\r\n\r\nOh, and please... only pizza crawl comments on this thread.  If you want to talk about the HBO deal, go down to my previous post and comment there.  I want this particular discussion to stay focused, thank you very much.","ditemid":11647,"eventtime":"2007-01-25 17:19:00","props":{"commentalter":1196719842,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-01-26 01:19:45","anum":127,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html","event_timestamp":1169745540,"reply_count":157,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?replyto=1441919","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1441919#t1441919","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1441919#t1441919","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1441919#t1441919","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1441919#t1441919","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bigmont","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bigmont.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1441919,"talkid":5632,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1441919#t1441919","upictitle":"Ser Mont: pic#64103160","article":"Wow I think I'm the first post.

But I can't do that until we know how many are going to be there.  To increase the odds of the pizza shop owners paying attention (and to get a little more attention for your books), I could contact the New Haven Register (the local newspaper) and maybe they could do a piece on the famous, best-selling author in town for a pizza judging.<br /><br />By the way, I have no opinion on which pizza is better.

Martin (George?),<br /><br />I'm a bit of a techno-tard, so I don't have an online avatar, but I couldn't let this post slip by. I live in Boston with a couple of guys who grew up in Connecticut, and here's their take on New Haven Pizza:<br /><br />1)It's fine, damn fine, and worth the wait, which is good because<br /><br />2)There will be one. Sally's, Pepe's and Moderno's are all small, hole-in-the wall joints, and the locals have preference. Regarding reservations: when President Clinton was in office, he wanted to eat at Sally's and the Secret Service called to book the place. Sally's said \"no.\" Which is awesome, but means we're probably in for some line-time. If we can get ahold of someone who knows the management, great. Otherwise, the reservation is being on the sidewalk.<br /><br />That said, it doesn't hurt to call, just in case. But I can think of things a lot worse than hanging for a while with you and the people who post on this blog. New Haven in February is kinda like the wrong side of the Wall, but if we bundle up it should be fine.<br /><br />And yeah, with all this \"we\" talk, I'm in. Main problem is transportation. If anyones is driving either direction with a seat to spare, I'd throw in for the gas, and it would be a huge help.<br /><br />New England Winter, sizzling Pizza, Ice and Fire.

I'm in, whatever the plan.  Though ending up someplace warm will be a good idea!  I'm just about 35 minutes north of New Haven so the planning would probably be best done by some of the New Havenites who have already posted, but I am open to working with anyone on coordination.<br /><br />Bruce Terrill -

While this is very likely, it's possible that being a Tuesday (I think?) we might be able to get in without a wait. I actually just went to Pepe's last week on a Wednesday at about 5:00 and walked right in and sat at a table, and there were a decent amount of empty tables. A Friday or Saturday would be an almost certain hour long wait at least, but weekdays there's at least a chance you can walk right in. :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"January 28 2007, 07:13:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Definitely","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://klitke.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"klitke","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"klitke","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://klitke.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"klitke","ctime_ts":1169968401,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/40561534/952330","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?replyto=1462655","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1462655#t1462655","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1462655#t1462655","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1462655#t1462655","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"klitke","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://klitke.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1462655,"talkid":5713,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/11647.html?thread=1462655#t1462655","above":1462399,"upictitle":"Kyle: RiverRescued","article":"I'm sorry, I thought I posted my name in there.
