{"itemid":228,"subject":"J - E - T - S, Jets Jets JETS!!!","event":"Sorry, Stego.  (But only a little).\r\n\r\nMy heart stopped several times this evening.\r\n\r\nWhat a game.\r\n\r\nI hate the prevent defense.  Hate it, hate it, hate it.  But that was a sensational catch by Randy Moss.  Though the Jets should have jammed him, as they'd been doing all game.  \r\n\r\nWhere the hell do the Patriots keep getting these great quarterbacks?  Matt Cassel was amazing, I have to say.  Four-year college benchwarmer, hasn't played since high school, but he gets better every game, and tonight he looked like the reincarnation of Johnny Unitas.  And he was what, a seventh round draft choice?  And Brady was a sixth rounder?  Scott Pioli has an amazing eye for quarterbacks.  The Jets back-up is Kellen Clemens, a second round choice and a major college star, but in the NFL so far he has been less than ordinary.  Let's just hope that Brett Favre never goes down.\r\n\r\nMuch as I despise him, Evil Little Bill is still a great coach.  Just when it looked as though the Jets were going to blow the P-men out on their own home field, BB goes to a no-huddle offense, and exhausts Gang Green's gigantic man in the middle, Kris Jenkins, negating our most effective defensive player.  No one else thought of that, all season.  Fortunately for truth, justice, and the American way, Jenkins was able to find a hidden reserve of strength in the fourth quarter, when it counted, but... I may despise Belichek, but I never make the mistake of underestimating him.\r\n\r\nBut enough props to the Patriots.  The Jets won.  Finally.  When Moss caught that TD with one second left, I felt like a dagger had been thrust through me, and the words \"Same Old Jets\" came inevitably to mind.  It felt like we'd already lost.  These were the Patriots, after all.  Even when we won the overtime coin toss, things looked grim... especially after the first two plays, when the Jets faced third-and-fifteen.  \r\n\r\nThen Brett threw that rope to Dustin Keller, and the world changed.\r\n\r\nFavre was... well, Favre was Favre.  He's done it before, he'll do it again.  Jericho Cotchery had that astonishing catch, snatching the ball out of the air in the crook of his elbow while falling forward with a defender draped all over him.  Leon Washington returned a kickoff for a TD.  But Dustin Keller was the one who really made me sit up.  It looks as though the Jets knew what they were doing when they traded up into the end of the first round to get him (and a good thing, since their other first round pick, number four overall Vernon Gholston, shows every sign of being a bust).  Tannenbaum and Mangini struck gold with Keller, I think.  We have our tight end for the next decade.\r\n\r\nAnyway... great game, great win, and I'm a happy boy.\r\n\r\nLife is magical and full of joy.","ditemid":58473,"eventtime":"2008-11-13 23:36:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":498,"current_moodid":59,"commentalter":1352586499,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","verticals_list":"life","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-11-14 06:53:34","anum":105,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html","event_timestamp":1226619360,"reply_count":65,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?replyto=4650345","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4650345#t4650345","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4650345#t4650345","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4650345#t4650345","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"miss_ion","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://miss-ion.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4650345,"talkid":18165,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4650345#t4650345","upictitle":"miss_ion: pic#0","article":"\"My heart stopped several times this evening.\"<br />Please say you're using idiom.

But come on, the defensive holding call against Mike Vrabel after the Pats stopped the Jets within the 10 in the last quarter was total BS.  It's just sad that even the announcer can say that he saw no hold there, yet the referee still chose to make a game-changing call like that.  And then the game goes into OT, which even if the Pats had won the game, I would still be complaining about.  Football OT is so ridiculously unfair that I'm surprised it is still handled the way it is.  A coin toss basically determines the game, not the skill of the teams.  It's just sad that after such an awesome game like last night, we had to have a coin toss give one team the ball and the game end on a field goal.  Give both teams a chance to score!  Do what college football does or make up some other rule that will get rid of this horribly unfair and archaic way of winning a game in OT.  Sorry to be so negative, the game was one of the most fun games of football I've seen in a while.  And I have to give credit to the Ancient One Brett Favre for not making any stupid mistakes.  But come on GRRM, Cassell was no Unitas.  He missed Moss twice on a wide open long ball that would have both been good for TDs, and he missed some other crucial passes that should have been made.  He was sharp in the fourth though, I'll give him that.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"November 14 2008, 14:51:05 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Football OT is so Annoying!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kevnola.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kevnola","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kevnola","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kevnola.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kevnola","ctime_ts":1226674265,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?replyto=4659049","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4659049#t4659049","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4659049#t4659049","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4659049#t4659049","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4659049#t4659049","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":4659049,"talkid":18199,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/58473.html?thread=4659049#t4659049","above":4655209,"upictitle":"George R.R.

Good, no doubt, but nowhere near Brady.  They showed some ridiculous stat about how Brady completed something like 54 20+ yard throws last year, and Cassel hadn't completed *one* in his last four games.  And it's obvious if you watched last night's game.  One deep bomb to Moss, he threw it to the outside when Moss was slightly cutting to midfield.  Another time Randy drew one-on-one coverage and raised his hand.  Cassel could have thrown a laser just to the outside of Moss (or heck, he could have lobbed an \"up-for-grabs\" ball that Moss probably would have pulled down), instead he threw it way high to the back of the end zone and complained to the refs that there was contact even when it was uncatchable (there was only minimal contact).  <br /><br />It's quite amazing, I think, that without Brady the Patriots could go 8-8 when with him I'd expect no less than 14 wins.  They've only been blown out in two games (Miami and San Diego), and you know damn well that they would have been in those games with Brady.  I enjoy watching Brady tear apart defenses, but at the same time, the door is now WIDE open for any team to win the Super Bowl.<br /><br /><br />But anyways, I'd take Matt Cassel over Gus Frerotte in a HEARTBEAT.
