{"itemid":292,"subject":"A Dance With Dragons","event":"No, it's not done.\r\n\r\nYes, I am aware that more than a year has passed since my last update.  A lot of you have been emailing me to point that out.  Thanks, but really, I did know.  Unlike many of you out there, I got my copies of the Song of Ice & Fire calendar, so I knew what date it was.\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not planning to update the update, for reasons stated in the update itself.  Until such time as I can write, \"It's done,\" it will remain the last update... aside from what I may say here from time to time, on my Not-A-Blog.\r\n\r\nI made a lot of progress on the book in the first half of 2008.  So much so that I was optimistic that I would be done by the end of the year.  Unfortunately, I did not make much progress on the book in the second half of 2008.  Indeed, I made some regress.  (That Sansa chapter I talked about finishing, for instance.  It's still finished, but my editor and I decided it belongs in THE WINDS OF WINTER, not A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, so it's been moved into the next book.  Sansa will not appear in DANCE.)\r\n\r\nSome of the reasons were literary, arising from problems in the narrative itself.  I'm not going to discuss them here, because I really do not like talking about questions I am still wrestling with on a work in progress.  It never helps.  Art is not a democracy, and these are problems I need to solve myself.  Having a few hundred readers weigh in with their thoughts and opinions -- which seems to be what happens whenever I post here about DWD -- does not advance the process.  I'm sorry, but that's true.  I know that many of you would like to help me, but you can't.  I have editors and I have two capable assistants, and that's sufficient.  I'm the only one who can dance this dance.\r\n\r\nSome of other reasons for the delay have nothing to do with the book itself.  They're extra-literary, arising from other things in my life.  I could sketch out some of them here, sure, but what good would it do?  Those who are inclined to understand would send me messages of sympathy and support.  Those are not so inclined would dismiss them as \"excuses,\" or even \"feeble excuses.\"  A few will even go so far as to accuse me of lying.\r\n\r\nThat's the part that really bothers me.  For the record, I have never lied about anything having to do with A DANCE WITH DRAGONS or the series as a whole.  I have been wrong, yes.  I have been wrong lots of time, especially when I've tried to predict how long it will take me to complete the book, or when it will be published.  Being wrong is not the same as lying.  Since the very beginning of this series, I have been guilty of being over-optimistic about how long it would take me to finish the next book, the next chapter, or the series as a whole.  I cannot deny that.  I have always been bad with deadlines... one reason why I did my best to avoid them for the first fifteen years of my career.  That's an option I no longer have, however.  Or at least will not have until A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is complete.\r\n\r\nThat's the main reason why I no longer want to give any completion dates.  I am sick and tired of people jumping down my throat when I miss them.  \r\n\r\nThis latest flood of emails has worn down my resolve, however.  So in hopes of quieting it, once more I will step into the breach --\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002tfw1/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0002tfw1/s320x240\" width=\"159\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI am trying to finish the book by June.  I think I can do that.  If I do, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS will likely be published in September or October.\r\n\r\n(Yes, I am aware that I have previously said that I hoped to finish by the end of 2008.  And before that, I said that I hoped to finish by June 2008, before I went to Spain and Portugal.  And before that, I said I hoped to finish by the end of 2007.  I know, I know, I know.  No, I was not lying.  I was wrong.  And wrong again.  And wrong before that.  This time I hope that I am right.  But you know, I can't swear that in blood.  I write one chapter at a time.  One page at a time.  One word at a time.  And then the next.)\r\n\r\nThat's all I have.  But it's more than Amazon has, or anyone else.  \r\n\r\nThe INSTANT that I finish the novel and put it in the mail to Bantam, I will post that fact here, just as I did for SUICIDE KINGS a few days ago.  Until and unless you read that announcement here, believe nothing you hear from any other source.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your continued support... and for your patience.","ditemid":74995,"eventtime":"2009-02-19 18:11:00","props":{"taglist":"dance with dragons","current_moodid":9,"commentalter":1299042446,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":856,"opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","hasscreened":1,"revtime":1299042465},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-02-20 01:58:13","anum":243,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html","event_timestamp":1235067060,"reply_count":624,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/80068694/1442560","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5326835#t5326835","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5326835#t5326835","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5326835#t5326835","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"firerosearien","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://firerosearien.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5326835,"talkid":20807,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5326835#t5326835","upictitle":"Firerose Arien: [info]open_the_blinds)","article":"The manuscript I thought I'd have finished by last May at the latest is only on page 210.<br /><br />Sometimes Life gets in the way.<br /><br />I will still be here, waiting patiently.

To be honest for me I have moved on from your books. I have found other authors I like and am reading them. Right now I am in the midst of Brent Weeks's \"Night Angel\" trilogy, and I just finished Joe Abercrombie's trilogy just completed with  Scott Bakker, Stephen Erikson and others on the horizon. <br /><br />I am still gonna buy the book, when it comes out, twice actually, once in hardcover, which will then become a Christmas gift or birthday gift to a friend, and then softcover for my own collection. <br /><br />I think the death of Robert Jordan taught me to cherish what we do have, rather than be upset for what may be. Best of luck with the writing, your efforts are appreciated.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 26 2009, 02:01:33 UTC","parent":5332979,"massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sensorglitch.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sensorglitch","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sensorglitch","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sensorglitch.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sensorglitch","ctime_ts":"1235613693","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121999248/6714885","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5333235#t5333235","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5333235#t5333235","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5333235#t5333235","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jojo_kun","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jojo-kun.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5333235,"talkid":20832,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/74995.html?thread=5333235#t5333235","upictitle":"My evil is strong: Journey - captured","article":"All the best with this! I'm waiting for DWD with a great deal of anticipation, but also with patience. I know how difficult it is to deal with the ebb and flow of creativity, and no, art is definitely not a democracy. You have to take what you can get and run with it when it comes to you. It might sound snobby but it's true - non-creative types will never understand how difficult it can be.<br /><br />You have weaved the story so wonderfully and so masterfully, and especially when a story like this is coming to a close I'll bet it just gets more and more difficult as you go.
