Not in the beginning, no.  And not so often of late either.  But in the middle, yes.  For decades and decades.  You could set your calendar by it.\r\n\r\nIt's still the best date for a big con.  Which is why Dragoncon moved there.\r\n\r\nDragoncon should go back to its original July dates.  And worldcon should go back to Labor Day.\r\n\r\nYes, I know all the arguments against.  Don't want to hear them again, thank you.
