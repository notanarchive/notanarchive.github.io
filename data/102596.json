{"itemid":400,"subject":"As Arya and Sansa Stark...","event":"... we have Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner, respectively.\r\n\r\nThese were the toughest ones to find clues for, since neither one can be found on IMDB, YouTube, Google, or any of the other places I searched.  When you google Maisie's name, however, you get a bunch of hits for Maizie Williams, a singer for an old pop group called Boney M.  But of course THAT Maizie Williams was not our Arya, hence the clue that one player was NOT a boney pop singer.\r\n\r\nHere's our Arya:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0005zqkw/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0005zqkw\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nSophie Turner was just as hard to find.  No, she's not the middle-aged actress who played in the DR. WHO episode.  She's not any of the other Sophie Turners that google will turn up, either. I thought about trying to cobble together some kind of \"not Sophie Tucker\" clue, but finally gave it up as a bad idea, and in the end I never did drop a hint for Sophie.  \r\n\r\nHere's Sansa:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00060h4s/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00060h4s\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\n(That's not the best picture, I know.  Sorry, didn't have a lot to choose from.  I am sure better pictures of both Maisie and Sophie will be forthcoming).\r\n\r\nYou guys cannot possibly know how hard these roles were to cast.  I've viewed dozens of readings for both girls.  Sweet kids, some with great looks, all of them bright and eager and enthusiastic... but good child actors are rare.  Maisie brought Arya alive in a way that none of the other kids could match, right from the first.  Sophie read two scenes; the scene with Arya on the kingsroad, and a much later one when Joff is forcing her to look at the heads on the walls.  Two very different sides of the character.  She knocked 'em both out of the park.\r\n\r\nI think you're going to love these girls.  I know I do.","ditemid":102596,"eventtime":"2009-08-21 00:16:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":310,"picture_keyword":"Spain","taglist":"a game of thrones, hbo","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1352694163,"personifi_tags":"40:8,28:11,18:17,6:5,8:17,41:2,1:8,3:20,24:17,25:23,26:2,9:20,21:2,14:5,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-08-21 06:31:18","anum":196,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html","event_timestamp":1250813760,"reply_count":37,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/92415067/21423069","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?replyto=6947524","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=6947524#t6947524","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=6947524#t6947524","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=6947524#t6947524","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jaimee2","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jaimee2.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":6947524,"talkid":27138,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=6947524#t6947524","article":"IF you are happy, then I am estatic!

For example, I'd say Jennifer Garner is kind of horse faced.

I don't think following the exact descriptions is as important as getting the basic feel of the character, though. Arya needs to be kind of plain-looking, able to pass for a boy, but also not look awful to the point that growing up to look a bit like her Aunt did is out the question.

If, as the original poster mentioned, the actress demonstrates the sort of acting range needed to accurately portray Sansa, then I am all the more enthused about this casting.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 22 2009, 19:56:15 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://fusereactor.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"fusereactor","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"fusereactor","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://fusereactor.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"fusereactor","ctime_ts":1250970975,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/54516103/1064291","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?replyto=7014596","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=7014596#t7014596","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=7014596#t7014596","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=7014596#t7014596","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"userj","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://userj.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7014596,"talkid":27400,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/102596.html?thread=7014596#t7014596","upictitle":"Josie: pic#54516103","article":"Arya's actress doesn't look much like her to me, but esp. with child actors, acting skill is FAR more important than looking the part because it's so rare...
