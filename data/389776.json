{"itemid":1522,"subject":"Signed Books","event":"Oldtimers here may recall that my old website once included a Signed Books page, where I offered autographed copies of some of my older, out of print books and foreign editions for sale via mailorder.&nbsp; Mostly as fan service.&nbsp; The books were usually hard to get, and of course many of my readers lived far away from my various tour stops and cons, making it unlikely that they&#39;d ever get an autograph by any other means.&nbsp; In the beginning, we never got more than a few orders a week.&nbsp; I used to fill them myself, once upon a time.&nbsp; Later my minions took that over.\r\n\r\nBut as the years passed, the number of orders rose and rose, and the number of queries grew even faster.&nbsp; Signing and shipping those books ate up more time every week.&nbsp;&nbsp; So much so that when we redesigned the website a year or so back, we closed the Signed Books page.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was intended to be temporary.&nbsp; I figured I&#39;d open a new and improved version of the page, with a shopping cart system, to make things easier on all concerned... but somehow we never got around to it.\r\n\r\nLast year, at Christmas season, I got a lot of emails about that.&nbsp; Readers wanting to buy autographed books as gifts, as they had in previous years.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now Christmas approaches again, and once more we are getting the same sort of emails.\r\n\r\nThis year, though, we have an answer.&nbsp; Of sorts.&nbsp; No, I am not going to reopen the old Signed Books page on the website.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have the time to personally inscribe dozens of books every week, and my office staff no longer has the time to pack and ship them.&nbsp; I need my loyal minions for other tasks, alas.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER... as it happens I also have the Jean Cocteau Cinema now, and the Cinema is also the state&#39;s smallest and most exclusive bookstore, where ALL the books on sale are autographed.&nbsp; Yes, needless to say, I drop by the Cocteau every so often, and sign piles of copies of my own titles... plus, we also have a wide stock of books signed by the many great authors who have appeared at the Cocteau for interviews, screenings, readings, and similar events.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"9315775975_860b64a093\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/223967/223967_600.jpg\" title=\"9315775975_860b64a093\" />\r\n\r\nUp to now, those books have only been available to those who stopped by the theatre in person.&nbsp;&nbsp; But after fifteen months in business, the stocks have built up, so we&#39;re going to try offering certain titles by mailorder.&nbsp; See how that goes.&nbsp; If we run into unanticipated problems, I may need to shut this down again... but my staff at the Cocteau are game to give it a try, so let&#39;s see how it works.\r\n\r\nLet me stress:&nbsp; ALL purchases, payments, and queries should go to the Cocteau.&nbsp; Please do not email us here at the office.&nbsp; I shut down the old Signed Books page because I did not have the time, and I still don&#39;t.&nbsp; The theatre HAS the time, the personnel, and the books.\r\n\r\nPlease also note: the books on offer are all autographed, but they <b><i><u>ARE NOT</u></i></b> inscribed or personalized, and that is not a service we can offer.&nbsp; I don&#39;t even personalize books at my booksignings any longer.&nbsp; I did so for decades, and happily, but I&#39;ve gotten older and the lines have gotten much, much longer, it&#39;s not something I can do any more.&nbsp; You&#39;ll just need to settle for my illegible scrawl.\r\n\r\nAnyway... let&#39;s try this out, see it it flies.\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS WOMEN just won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology (yay!).&nbsp; The Cocteau has 14 signed hardcovers in stock, I am informed, so we&#39;ll make that the first offering.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"91EWTSOg1IL._SL1500_\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/223584/223584_600.jpg\" title=\"91EWTSOg1IL._SL1500_\" />\r\n\r\nThe price is $32.50, plus $15 for shipping and handling (media mail) or $25 (priority), within the US.&nbsp; Overseas and foreign, please enquire.\r\n\r\nPayPal will be ONLY form of payment we can accept at present.&nbsp; Payments, orders, and queries can be sent directly to the Jean Cocteau Cinema (and Bookstore!) at <a href=\"mailto:jeancocteausantafe@gmail.com\">jeancocteausantafe@gmail.com</a>\r\n\r\nYes, we will offer other titles soon.&nbsp; My own books, and those by the other writers who have appeared at the Cocteay.&nbsp; But let&#39;s start with this one first.&nbsp; Call it a trial run.\r\n\r\nA DAY LATER:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; That worked.&nbsp; All our signed hardcovers of DANGEROUS WOMEN were gone within four hours.&nbsp; We got 45 orders for the 14 books.&nbsp; (We will try to get more, but that may take a while).\r\n\r\nSo: no more DW orders for the time being.&nbsp; We will offer some other books.&nbsp; See my next post.","ditemid":389776,"eventtime":"2014-11-08 22:40:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, signed books","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1416096655,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Signed Books http://j.mp/1sR1E1N","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[{\"eng\":1},{\"rus\":0}],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1416030021}","revtime":1416778697},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-11-15 05:39:23","anum":144,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389776.html","event_timestamp":1415486400,"reply_count":6,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124241086/73028880","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389776.html?thread=19743888#t19743888","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389776.html?thread=19743888#t19743888","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389776.html?thread=19743888#t19743888","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2876608","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/andy.gersick","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19743888,"talkid":77124,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/389776.html?thread=19743888#t19743888","upictitle":"Andy Gersick: pic#124241086","article":"Dear GRRM.
