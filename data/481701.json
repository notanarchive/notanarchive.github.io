{"itemid":1881,"subject":"This Week at the JCC","event":"We have a big week coming at the Jean Cocteau Cinema.\r\n\r\nERNIE CLINE will be here tomorrow (Sunday) for an interview and booksigning.  He'll be talking about the film adaptation of READY PLAYER ONE, and signing copies of ARMADA, his new one... and READY PLAYER ONE as well, of course.  For more details, see Jenni's post below.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Monday night, we'll show the last two hours in our season five marathon of GAME OF THRONES.  That's \"Hardhome\" and \"Mother's Mercy,\" two huge episodes.  If you haven't seen \"Hardhome\" on the big (well, medium sized) screen, you haven't seen it at all.  And best of all, admission is FREE.  First come, first seated.  Don't be late.\r\n\r\nAnd we another special event scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.  For TWO DAYS ONLY, we will be screening the new Project Itoh anime blockbuster out of Japan, EMPIRE OF CORPSES.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"718\"/>\r\n\r\nOnly a few selected theatres in the US will be showing EMPIRE OF CORPSES.  We're very pleased that the JCC will be one of them.  Come join us -- and remember, this special screening is for <i><b>two nights only.</b></i>\r\n\r\nThen, come Saturday, we're thrilled to announced that our midnight movies are returning.  First up will be FLASH GORDON.  No, not the old Buster Crabbe serial (and not FLESH GORDON either), but the Sam Jones version from 1980.  Brian Blessed and Ming the Merciless, what more could you want?\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"719\"/>\r\n\r\nCome in costume, you pathetic earthlings.  \r\n\r\nSee you at the movies.","ditemid":481701,"eventtime":"2016-04-16 18:29:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, movies, signings","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Apr 17 00:29:29 2016]R [Sun Apr 17 00:29:30 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/721495768373133312 ","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1461098413,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/721495768373133312","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.66601007658532]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1460853020}","revtime":1461098480},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-17 00:29:20","anum":165,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/481701.html","event_timestamp":1460831340,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/481701.html?thread=24235685#t24235685","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/481701.html?thread=24235685#t24235685","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/481701.html?thread=24235685#t24235685","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"muttonchopjesus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://muttonchopjesus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24235685,"talkid":94670,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/481701.html?thread=24235685#t24235685","article":"Not in Santa Fe, so I can't watch either of these at your theater, but I need to check out EMPIRE OF CORPSES somewhere.<br /><br />I know you're not much of an anime/manga guy, George, but have you at least seen some of the really famous anime films?

From Theodore Sturgeon? In his words:<br /><br /><i>\"I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud.\"</i><br /><br />I don't know if I agree with the '90% of SF is crud', or the more general '90% of <i>everything</i> is crud', but every time I watch anime I'm reminded of that 'law'. There is a huge amount of anime that downright makes my skin crawl, and which I imagine alienates lots of people new to the genre, but every once in awhile there's an absolute gem and I lament how some of the other stuff might keep people from watching it.
