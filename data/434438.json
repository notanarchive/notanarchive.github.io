{"itemid":1697,"subject":"The Horrors on Pluto","event":"Mordor is on Pluto!  Who knew?\r\n\r\nOkay, got to admit, I think it is really cool that some of the features New Horizons is finding on Pluto (our ninth planet, dammit!!!) and its moon Charon are being named Mordor and Cthulhu.  Who says science fiction and fantasy haven't arrived?  J.R.R. Tolkien and H.P. Lovecraft have entered realms previously reserved for Greek and Roman gods.\r\n\r\nThose ice mountains they've found are very cool too, and clearly need to be named the Mountains of Madness.  And of course when New Horizons sails on, deeper in the black realms beyond the solar system and finds a sinister tenth planet, we MUST name it Yuggoth.  Especially if it is covered in fungus.  (Which would be mind-blowing).\r\n\r\nI am disappointed that no alien ruins or black monoliths have turned up yet, but I don't suppose you can have everything.\r\n\r\nSo hurrah for JRRT, hurrah for HPL, and hurrah for NASA and JPL.  Nice to know they're fans.","ditemid":434438,"eventtime":"2015-07-15 14:12:00","props":{"current_mood":"bouncy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"space exploration, general nonsense, honors","current_moodid":59,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1437154786,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"The Horrors on Pluto http://goo.gl/zsW1EL","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.646799585002962]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1436991098}","revtime":1437608548},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-15 20:11:27","anum":6,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434438.html","event_timestamp":1436969520,"reply_count":62,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125201449/75106662","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434438.html?thread=22043910#t22043910","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434438.html?thread=22043910#t22043910","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434438.html?thread=22043910#t22043910","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434438.html?thread=22043910#t22043910","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"noblescrubjay","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://noblescrubjay.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22043910,"talkid":86109,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/434438.html?thread=22043910#t22043910","upictitle":"Cory Kendall: pic#125201449","article":"Yeah GRRM!
