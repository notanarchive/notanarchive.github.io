{"itemid":1643,"subject":"House Cleaning","event":"The Puppy Wars go on and on.\r\n\r\nI have made a number of blog posts about various issues raised by Puppygate, and every one has drawn hundreds of comments.  FYI, I have now started closing comments on the older posts.  With so many replies and replies to replies, I can't even find the unscreened comments any more, and I don't want more piling on.  So I will let those topics move down and eventually onto the next page, but let's direct comments to the newer posts.\r\n\r\nExcept for this one, which is closed to comments, since it is just an announcement.","ditemid":420836,"eventtime":"2015-04-15 05:15:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","opt_nocomments":1,"current_moodid":91,"crosspost_tw":" House Cleaning http://goo.gl/Jh1uvE","give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.535559001953102],[\"fra\",0.106878271272765]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1429136075}"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-15 22:14:19","anum":228,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/420836.html","event_timestamp":1429074900,"reply_count":0}
