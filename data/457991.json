Starting on Friday, December 11, for one week only, we will be screening the newly restored and remastered \"signature edition\" of Brad Bird's animated classic, THE IRON GIANT.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"640\"/>\r\n\r\nIf you haven't seen THE IRON GIANT... or even if you have... you don't want to miss this.  If you've only seen it on the small screen at home, you don't want to miss this.  And even if you've seen the movie in a theatre, you don't want to miss this, since the signature editions includes some new scenes never before shown.\r\n\r\nIn honor of the occasion, the Iron Giant his own self will be on hand to say hi.  You don't want to miss him either.  Come see the movie, and have your picture taken with the Giant.  Advance tickets can be reserved at the JCC website.","ditemid":457991,"eventtime":"2015-12-06 17:21:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, movies","crosspost_tw_log":"[Tue Dec  8 00:21:26 2015]R [Tue Dec  8 00:21:27 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/674020932101365760 ","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1449776833,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/674020932101365760","picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":2,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.691849392163139]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1449534133}","revtime":1450746742},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-08 00:21:25","anum":7,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457991.html","event_timestamp":1449422460,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125326985/75443278","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457991.html?thread=23223815#t23223815","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457991.html?thread=23223815#t23223815","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457991.html?thread=23223815#t23223815","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"storm59","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://storm59.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23223815,"talkid":90718,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457991.html?thread=23223815#t23223815","article":"One of my all time favorites.
