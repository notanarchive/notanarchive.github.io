{"itemid":1535,"subject":"A Sickly Shade of Green","event":"We,, the Jets blew another one.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;For reasons that defy human understanding, Geno Smith was restored as starting quarterback tonight.&nbsp; Since Smith seems to be an interception machine who completes more passes to the opponents than his own receivers, Rex Ryan wisely declined to let him throw, and went with an old-fashioned ground-and-pound running game to shove the ball down Miami&#39;s throat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;It almost worked.&nbsp; Chris Ivory, Chris Johnson, and Percy Harvin all ran well, Gang Green dominated time of possession and took an early lead, running up huge yardage numbers on the ground.&nbsp; Since Geno wasn&#39;t passing, there were no back-breaking turnovers.&nbsp; All through the first half, nothing the Dolphins did seemed to stop the Jets&#39; running attack.&nbsp; Seven men in the box, eight men in the box, nine men in the box...&nbsp; And the Jets D was shutting down the Dolphin offense too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;But yards aren&#39;t points, and long drives are worthless if they don&#39;t end in touchdowns, or at least field goals.&nbsp; For all the Jets dominance, their lead was never very big.&nbsp; And in the second half, of course, the wheels came off.&nbsp; The usually reliable Nick Folk missed two field goals, the Jets D dropped two sure interceptions, there were untimely penalties, breakdowns on special teams... and whenever Geno was called upon to pass, the result was incompletions.&nbsp; In the final minutes of the game, Miami went ahead.\r\n\r\nBut there were still almost two minutes left.&nbsp; The Jets still had a chance.&nbsp; All they had to do was move into field goal range.&nbsp; But that mean Geno would have to pass.&nbsp; The game was on the line, so of course... sack, incompletion, interception.&nbsp; Game over.\r\n\r\nRex, Rex, Rex, you deserve better.&nbsp; The good players on the team deserve better.&nbsp; The fans deserve better.\r\n\r\nGeno Smith is a bust.&nbsp; Michael Vick is done.&nbsp; Sit them down.\r\n\r\n<b><i>WE WANT MATT SIMMS!!!</i></b>\r\n\r\nIs he the answer?&nbsp; Hell, I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; But he&#39;s the only other quarterback on the roster besides Vick and Smith, and he sure can&#39;t be any worse than what Geno showed last night, or in that Buffalo game I attended when I was in New York.&nbsp; And if he has even half the guts and smarts and arm of his father, he might even win a few of these last games.\r\n\r\nMaybe he doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; Maybe he&#39;ll lose them all.&nbsp; That would tell us something too.&nbsp; Then we&#39;d know the Jets had<b><i> no</i></b> starting-calibre QBs on the roster, and we can try and draft that kid from Oregon next season.","ditemid":393060,"eventtime":"2014-12-02 00:49:00","props":{"current_mood":"sick","current_location":"some green hell","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":82,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1418514869,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"A Sickly Shade of Green http://j.mp/1yFK6wv","picture_keyword":"thumbs down","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":2,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[{\"eng\":1},{\"rus\":0}],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1417506487}","revtime":1418515712},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-12-02 07:48:07","anum":100,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393060.html","event_timestamp":1417481340,"reply_count":21,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124304781/73361886","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393060.html?thread=19785316#t19785316","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393060.html?thread=19785316#t19785316","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393060.html?thread=19785316#t19785316","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2903014","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/mr.michaelkessler","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19785316,"talkid":77286,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/393060.html?thread=19785316#t19785316","upictitle":"Mike Kessler: pic#124304781","article":"GRRM- do you play fantasy?

He's had a different approach to coaching, calling Superbowl victories in the preseason.  But you can't forget that a lot of that success was on the back of a good defense, a strong running game (both things he added to, but didn't build himself), and a LOT of luck:<br />  - The year we lost to the Colts, we should've never even made the playoffs - The Colts were on their way to a perfect season, In Week 16, Manning was sat and they ended up losing - that loss propelled us into the playoffs.<br /><br />We went further than we should have those 2 years.. It was a lot of fun and I'm glad he brought the leadership to convince the team that it could do anything... <br /><br />But his style of coaching also led to a huge mess in the locker room <br />  -Remember the media storm in years 3 and 4?  <br />  -Remember the locker room mess with Santonio?<br />  -Remember Tim Tebow?  <br /><br />Izdik was brought in, and we wasted a 2nd round pick on Geno... Effectively giving Rex another fresh QB to win with.  He was poorly used and now we're in a worse state than we were before.  The only reason he wasn't fired last year was because we beat the Dolphins at the end of the season to end their playoff hopes.  It was a stupid moral victory that masked the awful season we had; a season where our record didn't reflect our performance.<br /><br />Now just look at this season.  We've got 2 wins (one of them is vs Oakland).  I don't care how bad your offense is, the NFL is full of professional players who should be able to win on Any Given Sunday.  Good coaching would have resulted in at least a 5-6 win season.  Good coaching would've beat the Vikings last week.  It's time for a regime change.<br /><br />Ok rant over, I really want to understand why you think he's good for us?  To me, he's stunting our growth and contributing to the 'same old jets' theme.  It's time for him to go...
