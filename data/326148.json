{"itemid":1274,"subject":"Shocked and Saddened","event":"I was saddened this morning to hear about the sudden death of James Gandolfini in Italy, of an apparent heart attack.  He was only fifty-one.\r\n\r\nI don't recall that I ever met Gandolfini, though we may have been present at one or more HBO events over the past couple of years (those are large gatherings), but I was huge admirer of his acting.  THE SOPRANOS was \"must watch TV\" for us every year it was on.  A terrific show, with a terrific cast... Gandolfini first and foremost among them.  It was the show that redefined drama on television, proving once and for all the audiences would gladly follow a flawed, grey, violent character, provided he was interesting enough.  A ground-breaking show, an important show, it helped define HBO's \"brand,\" and set the tone for many of the great HBO dramas to follow, including DEADWOOD, ROME, THE WIRE, BOARDWALK EMPIRE... and GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nGandolfini was a fellow Jersey boy and Jets fan as well.\r\n\r\nA huge talent.  I never knew him, but I will miss him all the same.","ditemid":326148,"eventtime":"2013-06-20 10:20:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"life and death","current_moodid":25,"commentalter":1372920053,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sadface","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":3,"revtime":1372920073},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-06-20 16:20:27","anum":4,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326148.html","event_timestamp":1371723600,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121287300/65112423","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326148.html?thread=17839364#t17839364","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326148.html?thread=17839364#t17839364","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326148.html?thread=17839364#t17839364","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2030508","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/_JakeHedges","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17839364,"talkid":69685,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/326148.html?thread=17839364#t17839364","upictitle":"Jake Hedges: pic#121287300","article":"Aye, Such a sad day.

For real. <br /><br />The most chilling thing was that I was minutes away from sitting down to an Italian dinner and an episode of 'The Sopranos' (as I am currently rewatching the whole series) when I heard the news. So then I teared up off-and-on throughout the entire episode that I watched. :(<br /><br />I've always loved that show, and I've also loved Gandolfini in everything I've ever seen him in.

Sorry if this is an inappropriate place to put this, but I actually thought it might cheer you somewhat. I was recently reading a Song of Ice and Fire forum and found a link to a post on reddit, written by a young person who is a dwarf about their experiences reading about Tyrion Lannister for the first time. I thought it was quite touching, and although I don't know the original author at all, I found myself wondering if you had read it. I attempted to link it here, but it seems that links are automatically regarded as spam (I understand why, of course). In any case, it's a nice read by someone who was obviously very moved by the character, and if you're interested, you could easily find it by googling \"Reddit a dwarf's perspective on Tyrion Lannister\". It should be the first result.<br /><br />Again, I'm sorry about your loss and I hope talking about something else here doesn't make it seem as if I'm diminishing that, but my hope is that reading this would make you happy; as a writer, I know it would mean a great deal to me if one of my characters had been able to touch someone like that.

Keep at it.  <br /><br />You should make up your own world as well as your own characters, though.  Let Italo have his own adventures in his own story, rather than tying him in with Arya and Nymeria and my cast.
