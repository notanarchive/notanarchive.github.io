{"itemid":1948,"subject":"Football Is Back","event":"The NFL regular season is upon us.  And with it, the agony and the ecstasy.\r\n\r\nI got a taste of both yesterday from my two teams.\r\n\r\nThe Jets ripped my guts out and stomped on them with an agonizing one-point loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in the morning game, as the Jets have a habit of doing.  But in the afternoon game, the Giants made me smile and whoop and cheer with a rousing one-point win over the Dallas Cowboys.  \r\n\r\nA single point was the difference in both games.  The difference between joy and despair.\r\n\r\nAh, we sports fans are a strange and peverse bunch.  It really makes no difference whatsoever to my life whether my teams win or lose... yet somehow it makes a vast difference to my mood.  And these close games are going to kill me, I swear.   Even that wonderful Giants victory could easily have become a second agonizing defeat, if a certain Dallas wideout had cut right instead of left when he caught the game's final pass from the rookie Cowboy qb.\r\n\r\nFwiw, the Jet defense looked formidable even in defeat, sacking Bengals qb Andy Dalton seven times.  How Gang Green managed to lose the game despite that boggles belief, but after decades as a Jets fan, I am used to being boggled.\r\n\r\nThe Giants defense was not nearly as impressive... but given that last year Big Blue had the worst defense in the NFL, I still have to give them props.   I had rather hoped the Giant offense would rack up hundreds of passing yards against a weak Dallas D and crush the boys, but that did not happen, alas.  Still, they played well enough to win.  Odell is still amazing, the rookie wideout Shepard looks like the real deal, but the real highlight of the day for me was seeing Victor Cruz catch a touchdown pass and do his salsa dance.  Cruz is one of my favorite Giants of all time, a true Cinderella story, and a lot of people thought he would never make it back after his devastating injury two years ago.  It was so great to see him dancing.\r\n\r\nAh, well.  A long season awaits.  More agony, more ecstasy.\r\n\r\nP.S.  I love Chris Berman, but NFL COUNTDOWN, long my favorite pregame show, is not the same without Tom Jackson.  I missed Mike Ditka and Chris Carter too, but Jackson and Berman were the Huntley and Brinkley of sports.","ditemid":498786,"eventtime":"2016-09-12 12:32:00","props":{"current_mood":"drained","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Sep 12 18:32:24 2016]R [Mon Sep 12 18:32:25 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/775401697296289792 ","current_moodid":40,"commentalter":1473910610,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/775401697296289792","picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.673354370326271]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1473705170}","revtime":1473958320},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-09-12 18:32:22","anum":98,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html","event_timestamp":1473683520,"reply_count":36,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126505887/78484470","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24972898#t24972898","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24972898#t24972898","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24972898#t24972898","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3817945","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/glasscannonpod","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24972898,"talkid":97550,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24972898#t24972898","article":"Definitely second your sentiments re: Tom Jackson.

Rams will probably bolt the first time the area refuses to built a new stadium with public money. At least I like Coach Fisher so I will root for them while they are here, at least until hockey kicks in.

Anyway, it’s all a much-needed, sanity-preserving distraction from working on my doctoral dissertation (my very own “Son of Kong”).

I believe allot of it has to do with Fitzy missing time and Brandon Marshall needing to get comfortable with an ailing hip(that is an injury that just doesn't get better, I know). Forte  looked great both running and in the passing game, that will be big throughout the season. AJ Green was a tough draw for Revis Island, not much you can do when a perfect ball is thrown high over a shorter defender, all he can do is jam him. Hopefully it will light a fire under him, legends always bounce back. <br /><br />Chargers fan myself and we lost Keenan Allen, who I think is every bit as good as your OBJR if only he could stay healthy.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 months ago","ctime":"September 13 2016, 01:39:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Will take some time for Jets...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://mrjoshuaspeaks.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"mrjoshuaspeaks","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"mrjoshuaspeaks","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://mrjoshuaspeaks.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"September 13 2016, 03:07:53 UTC","dname":"mrjoshuaspeaks","ctime_ts":1473730779,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/127062957/33647510","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24982882#t24982882","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24982882#t24982882","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24982882#t24982882","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_392997","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/Irtanu","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24982882,"talkid":97589,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498786.html?thread=24982882#t24982882","upictitle":"Alexander Pendergrass: pic#127062957","article":"The Lions offense was fantastic, Stafford immaculate, and they managed to win on the road as underdogs.
