{"itemid":705,"subject":"Sunday at Octocon","event":"Having a great, if exhausting, time at Octocon in Dublin.  The Irish fen are wonderfully hospitable, and the BWBers are great company, as always.\r\n\r\nI am still feeling borderline sick and my time sense is knackered, however.  I hit the wall at seemingly random moments and have to stagger off to nap, absp;utely canNOT keep my eyes open... but then I sleep for an hour or two, get a second wind, and wake up ready to roar late into the night.  Last night I had to collpase after supper, but O staggered down again in time to pick the raffle winners, then partied till three in the morning, swilling down coke after coke and arguing about sex in the books.  Somehow I found myself between half a dozen women who want some explicit male/male scenes in the books and a couple of dissenters who don't... from there we wandered into Myrish swamps and were never seen again...\r\n\r\nIt was a strange night.  Today I'm paying for it.","ditemid":180483,"eventtime":"2010-10-17 13:35:00","props":{"current_location":"dublin","current_moodid":14,"commentalter":1292888639,"personifi_word_count":171,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"18:6,6:6,10:20,3:26,5:6,4:13,20:13,9:33,44:6,22:13,14:6,nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1287319030},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-10-17 12:35:02","anum":3,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html","event_timestamp":1287322500,"reply_count":134,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?replyto=11177987","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11177987#t11177987","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11177987#t11177987","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11177987#t11177987","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11177987#t11177987","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11177987,"talkid":43664,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11177987#t11177987","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Linda joins those half-dozen ladies.

I am glad to hear that John Howe has already had some involvement with your work.  I hope to see more in the future!<br /><br />I also got my copy of Ted Nasmith's \"A Song Of Ice And Fire\" calendar, and the work is truly wonderful.  Personally, I feel that it does justice to your own great work.  The whole calendar is captivating, but some of my personal favourites are \"Winterfel\", \"Storms's End\" and \"The Wall\".  \"The Wall\" and \"Storm's End\" give me goosebumps everytime I look at them!<br /><br />I wanted to ask you, I know that it is not up to you, and I am aware that oftentimes you depend on HBO for any news like the rest of us, but since you are more intimately involved with \"A Game Of Thrones\", I was wondering, are there any news on who will work on the soundtrack for the show?<br /><br />I must say that many fans, me included, would love to see Bear McCreary involved with the project.  His soundtrack for \"Battlestar Galactica\" was fantastic to say the least! I have been listening to the work he did on \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" (starring the beautiful Lena Headey...I feel some kind of Six Degrees of Separation coming on...ah poor Kevin Bacon!) and I love it.  His most recent work is the soundtrack for another great show \"Caprica\", which is the prequel to \"Battlestar Galactica\". He would most definitely be an asset to HBO...<br /><br />Harry Gregson Williams who scored Ridley Scott's masterpiece \"Kingdom Of Heaven\", would, in my mind, also be a worthy candidate, as would a true HBO stalwart, Jeff Beal, who scored the fascinating \"Carnivale\" and the truly awesomely epic \"ROME\".  Or what about the team of Rob Lane and Joseph Vitarelli who created the truly moving music for \"John Adams\", another high point of HBO programming!<br /><br />I know that you have no control over any of this, but any insight or tidbits would be most welcome, as I personally think that music is soo important, especially for such work of high quality as \"A Song Of Ice And Fire\"!  One only has to look at what Howard Shore (any chance of getting him?), did for Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy.  I couldn't imagine the movies withouth Shore's music!<br /><br />Look forward to this one...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"October 18 2010, 01:45:44 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Eire","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://loco73.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"loco73","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"loco73","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://loco73.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"loco73","ctime_ts":1287366344,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?replyto=11183107","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11183107#t11183107","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11183107#t11183107","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11183107#t11183107","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11183107#t11183107","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hercules7071","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hercules7071.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11183107,"talkid":43684,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11183107#t11183107","upictitle":"hercules7071: pic#0","article":"Please, please, no m/m sex scenes.

I'll be a naysayer since there seems to be a supportive pull in the m/m corner so far. (From reading above, I'm now trying to remember where a f/f scene took place, it escapes my memory)<br /><br />Anywho, explicit m/m is an extreme reading turnoff for straight males. Extreme spelled with a capital X, flashy lights at a Hollywood opening and a bloated advertising campaign. You know... Xtreme turnoff.<br /><br />Not looking to burst bubbles here, but I'd very much like to avoid any m/m scenarios in my much beloved reading. I'll give a short story on how this can effect a reading experience adversely. I was reading Myrren's Gift by Fiona McIntosh. Very strong start, good ideas, well written, violent, assassinations etc etc (book had a complete lack of sex thus far). Enjoying the read. Story continues, turns out one of the main characters is, very surprisingly gay, and suddenly forests are farting out unicorns and a fuzzy assortment of cutesy animals. (not kidding about the forest)<br /><br />Writing this is difficult without sounding like a homophobe. Being lead by the author to like and respect a manly character, who then does what appears to be, and feels like, a 180 turn in direction for what one would expect of his traits, and to have a seemingly 'straight' story take an about face... it felt dishonest and it put me off the book, series, and author, entirely.<br /><br />Were GRRM to do it, I'd just have to gloss over that section and continue on, because he's too damn good a writer not to forgive it. For a lesser author, they're in the bucket.<br /><br />Many ladies like the m/m... I'll never understand why, but I do understand that much. If one of Gregor's men were to rape a village boy, that would be in character, and to a degree expected. It would be like reading a torture scene, but it would fit in the books. Were Jon Snow to take a turn for the other team with Stannis... just throw me to the Others.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"October 18 2010, 04:46:52 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://avernus-wpg.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"avernus_wpg","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"avernus_wpg","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://avernus-wpg.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"avernus_wpg","ctime_ts":1287377212,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?replyto=11184131","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11184131#t11184131","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11184131#t11184131","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11184131#t11184131","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11184131#t11184131","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"assistantty","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://assistantty.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11184131,"talkid":43688,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/180483.html?thread=11184131#t11184131","above":11183619,"upictitle":"assistantty: pic#0","article":"\"Anywho, explicit m/m is an extreme reading turnoff for straight males.

Your books, Mr Martin, are wonderfully uncomfortable at times. It only seems appropriate, and it would truly fit, to have such scenes included in those gritty pages.<br /><br />Not that the opinions of a few fans should influence you. The books should spring from your muse, not our prattling. <br /><br />Anyway, enough of my slightly schizophrenic rambling... if it takes a hot and heavy Renly/Loras flashback to get this book on the shelves so be it!
