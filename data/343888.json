Re: popcorn oil. Ser, I think someone steered you wrong there... coconut oil is the piece de resistance of popping oils. It is expensive, has a high smoke point, and it's ideal for popcorn. In fact many small indy theaters still use it, and people will come in just for the popcorn, sans the movie. Canola oil or other soy or vegetable \"protein\" oils are the cheapo garbage the multiplexes all use, and once you've air popped with coconut, there's no going back.<br /><br />Interesting back story: before I got into the frozen yogurt business, I owned and operated a strip club in Jersey. What was unique about my joint was I was one of the first in the exotic dancing industry to cater to nerd culture, so to speak. The girls all wore sci-fi and video game costumes, everything was SF-F oriented, hell, we even had Lovecraft decor on the walls. Basically think Jack Rabbit Slim's from Pulp Fiction but geared to the nerd subculture niche. Anyway, one of our dancers was a real gourmet type (she was the better, more endowed of our two Lara Crofts ;), and I bought her air popper off her and she introduced me to coconut oil. It was a huge hit at the club. In fact, I was critical in the process of introducing the soon to be released coconut oil flavored frozen yogurt to my southwest Sweet Frog franchises.<br /><br />- Jeff","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"October 27 2013, 21:29:46 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://geshtarr.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"geshtarr","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"geshtarr","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://geshtarr.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"geshtarr","ctime_ts":1382909386,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343888.html?thread=18386512#t18386512","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343888.html?thread=18386512#t18386512","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343888.html?thread=18386512#t18386512","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18386512,"talkid":71822,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/343888.html?thread=18386512#t18386512","above":18386000,"upictitle":"George R.R.
