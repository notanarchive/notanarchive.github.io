{"itemid":1799,"subject":"The Rumble, Resolved","event":"Well, the controversy about the Odell Beckham/ Josh Norman tangle on Sunday has been resolved... for now.  \r\n\r\nODB received a one-game suspension from the NFL.  He appealed the suspension, as was his right under collective bargaining.  The appeal was heard today, and denied, so the suspension will stand, and Beckham will not play next weekend when the Giants meet the Vikings.  He will also lose a game check, which will cost him something like $60,000.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the ruling, Beckham issued a very classy apology:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.giants.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Statement-from-Odell-Beckham-Jr-/c1ce6b60-5c85-4813-a1ec-6f786e0ed522\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the NFL has also taken steps to fine CB Josh Norman of the Panthers some $26,000 for his own actions in the game.   I would have preferred to see Norman suspended as well, since he was the instigator... but ODB did go further, and $26 grand is not nothing, so a rough sort of justice was done.  Unlike Beckham, there have been no apologies forthcoming from Norman, just more trash talk.  Now he is getting into it with Roddy White, a receiver for the Atlanta Falcons.  One has to wonder whether Norman has learned anything.  Sunday will show us.\r\n\r\nThe NFL has also forbidden teams to carry baseball bats and other 'foreign objects' onto the field during the pregame and post-game, which is probably a good idea.   It would be nice if they also passed some rules to treat homophobic slurs the same way they do racist slurs, but so far that hasn't happened.\r\n\r\nI expect Odell will learn from this, and come back next year bigger and better than ever.\r\n\r\nThis year?  Not much hope there.  The Giants are done.","ditemid":460574,"eventtime":"2015-12-23 17:19:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Dec 24 00:18:00 2015]R [Thu Dec 24 00:18:02 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/679818277657313281 ","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1450986350,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/679818277657313281","give_features":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.641138894456348]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1450916307}"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-24 00:17:56","anum":30,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html","event_timestamp":1450891140,"reply_count":16,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121411156/65344279","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?replyto=23304222","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23304222#t23304222","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23304222#t23304222","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23304222#t23304222","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2058420","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23304222,"talkid":91032,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23304222#t23304222","upictitle":"GeekFurious: pic#121411156","article":"If only this was the most egregious thing that happened to the Giants this season.

Plus, if I was a Giants fan I wouldn't want to change it up. In Baseball, managerial changes to a consistent team sometimes can light a fire in players, to compete harder. However, football is different, and consistency within a program Is key to their success. I will admit I'm a Patriots fan, but I have come to respect Coughlin. Even though 2007&2012 hurt to think about. Just look at his record against the most consistent team, or franchise, of the last two decade. Even those two Giants super bowl teams, weren't run always during the regular season. Though once into the playoffs they thrived because of Coughlins abilities to game plan, not get intimidated, and to make tough calls. These attributes are not things you have seen consistently enough throughout the rest NFL over the past 16 weeks. This just shows how some coaches, including Coughlin, don't come around often, and are just in a class of their own.

I figured he wouldn't issue until after the hearing. While some say his actions Sunday say a lot about him, so does that statement in a very good way. He 100% owned up to his actions and blamed no one but himself. You can't ask anymore of a man than that. <br /><br />I hope Norman issues some sort of apology as well.  Though it should be noted, OBJ didn't apologize to the Panthers or Norman, not real surprising. But I wouldn't expect Norman to apologize to them either. <br /><br />Yea $26000 isn't small. I myself am guilty of thinking they can afford it, but in reality that's a lot. Especially for people that aren't the top paid in the NFL.  I'm actually surprised he wasn't fined more.  He did grab the ref after the second altercation between himself and OBJ.  Which is a stiff fine. So they must have had good reasons not to. <br /><br />As far as Roddy White or the Falcons, he was responding to THEIR trash talk.  They gave him no respect saying he wasn't that good.  So not sure why Norman in more words saying Roddy White isn't good is wrong.  This is normal trash talk around the NFL on a weekly basis.  Norman is just under more scrutiny now because of last week.  But nothing said by either side is uncalled for.  <br /><br />As far as homophobic slurs, even their punter Brad Wing has said he heard no homophobic slurs.  And he was right next to OBJ.  So it shouldn't be assumed that it actually happened.  I understand some big name ex players have said the Panthers said it, but what proof do they have?  Were they there?  I'll stick to Brad Wing's statement that there were no homophobic slurs.  And maybe it did happen at a different point in the game when Brad wasn't around.  <br /><br />Other athletes have voiced their opinion that players moms and kids are off limits and everything else is game.  Not saying it's ok to make homophobic slurs, and a lot of things people say are probably just as bad. I do get that it's a new era, and there are things that society in general just doesn't accept anymore that used to be acceptable.  Maybe there will be some sort of statement from the NFL on the matter whether it's ever proven or not. <br /><br />Now Brad Wing did say he heard Marcus Ball threaten OBJ about ending his day etc... It's hard to not believe him. Admittedly inside I really really hope it's not true. But I hope the Panthers and the NFL ado get to the bottom of it and act accordingly.  I absolutely don't believe there is a place on any team for someone making threats like that to another player.  And I would expect he would not have a place on the Panthers team either.

The NFC East is a squirrelier division than Matthew Stafford doing Ray Lewis' dance. The Eagles could easily throw the hiccupping Washington Potatoes this weekend, and then Washington could go to Dallas and do what they did just before they began their meh 2 game win streak. If the Giants somehow give Peterson and crew a little belt on the chops Sunday night, they'll have the Eagles at home to do a tap dance. And that would make them, at 8-8 the division winner.<br />Now consider, in 2007, they lost to the undefeated Pats 35-38 on the last game of the season and went on as a 10-6  regular season team to beat them in the Super Bowl. In 2011, four years later, they lost 35-38 in game 12 to the then undefeated Packers, finished 9-7, and then went on to beat them in the divisional round before beating the Pats again in the Super Bowl. And now four years later, and it's 2015, and the Giants lose to the undefeated Panthers,by 35-38. Three undefeated P teams by the same score four years a part. And they can go 8-8 and win the division and, if so, face the Panthers in the divisional round. And the Patriots are poised to go back to the Super Bowl.<br />Do you not see the fates align? To go and win Super Bowls as a 10-6, 9-7, 8-8, defeat the unbeaten team you lost to, and then face the original unbeaten team whose flirtation with history you destroyed? Wouldn't that be a story worth remembering?<br />Of course, the alternative is that the Panthers get to the Super Bowl undefeated and they lose to the Patriots, who get redemption at last.

I'm more a lurker than a poster but we all have opinions on sports so here's mine 😁 <br /><br />This game has highlighted the hypocrisy of sports media and the over reaction of sports fans in general. When the refs throw the flags and stops the players from being physical, pundits and fans scream \"let them play\" then when the refs \"let them play\" it shouldn't be a surprise that the players do whatever it takes to get an edge. Norman walked the edge of the line but he mostly played with in the rules. Sure he got away with some stuff but so do lineman on every single play. Odj lost control and blatantly committed what has become the most egregious sin in the NFL (intentional helmet to helmet) up until then the line was not crossed. <br /><br />NFL players notoriously talk trash on the field. Most can keep control, some will shove, a few throw punches, obj threw his head. Closed fist punches and helmet shots are illegal, trash talk and shoving is not. Of course Norman egged him on and most likely instigated it but Norman didn't cross the line in my opinion, just went as close as possible to it.<br /><br />The bat thing is silly. Lots of teams \"bring the wood\" now because odj used it as a reason for his actions the NFL will ban that type of team motivation. Maybe the panthers did insinuated they would use a bat on him, so what. Did he really think they would actually do it in a crowed stadium with cameras everywhere. I like odj and his actions in that game didn't change my opinion of him. He got frustrate and he handled it poorly, he is human. Still a great player. <br /><br />As to the homophobic slurs. They probably happened, its probably happened on every field in every game for generations. Anyone that has played any level of footballs will tell you this. Is it right? Is it PC? absolutely not. But it happens and its not fair to Norman to say we have always turned a blind eye to it but in your case, its not cool. Going forward, if the NFL wants to crack down on homophobic comments, I'm all for it. But I don't think its right to punish one guy for doing something that many in the league no do. <br /><br />Just my opinion.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 24 2015, 15:50:21 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"first time poster","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/scumhorror","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"scumhorror","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3442703","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77219526&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"scumhorror","ctime_ts":1450972221,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124353126/73550426","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?replyto=23308318","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23308318#t23308318","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23308318#t23308318","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23308318#t23308318","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2920892","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/andrew.firestone1","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23308318,"talkid":91048,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/460574.html?thread=23308318#t23308318","upictitle":"Andrew Firestone: pic#124353126","article":"Oh my God!
