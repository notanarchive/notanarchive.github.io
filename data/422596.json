{"itemid":1650,"subject":"Remembering Roger","event":"On June 14, 1995 Roger Zelazny died at St. Vincent's Hospital here in Santa Fe.  Though it seems very hard to believe -- for his voice and his presence are still very much with those who knew and loved him, and his words will live forever -- this June will mark the twentieth anniversary of Roger's passing.\r\n\r\nAt the memorial service shortly after his death, I spoke a few words about Roger and his work, and what he meant to me and to SF and the wider world of literature.  You can read them here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.georgerrmartin.com/about-george/friends/in-memoriam-roger-zelazny/\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/248522/248522_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nTwenty years is a long time, but Roger and his work are still remembered.  With the dark day of that anniversary approaching, we thought the time was right to share some of our memories of this amazing man and his incredible stories.  It did not feel right to do it on June 14, however; we want to celebrate his life and his work, not his death.  So we chose May 31 instead.\r\n\r\n<b>On Sunday night, May 31, the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe will offer a special one-time only night of readings and reminiscences we're calling \"Remembering Roger.\"</b>\r\n\r\nRoger's son Trent, a fine writer in his own right, is organizing the event for us, and other members of Roger's family are also expected to attend, along with lots of us from the New Mexico science fiction community and Albuquerque fandom.  I will be there, as will Jane Lindskold, Melinda Snodgrass, Walter Jon Williams, John Jos. Miller, and many many more.  We have lots of folks coming in from out of town as well.  Neil Gaiman is trying to make it, if his schedule allows.  Joe Haldeman is flying in.  So is Michael Cassutt.  And many folks who cannot come to New Mexico in person will be Skyping in to join us, or sending video greetings and readings.  Joe Lansdale, Steven Brust, Howard Waldrop, and others will be heard from.\r\n\r\nWe won't be showing DAMNATION ALLEY, no... but we may screen the trailer, just for hoots and giggles.  We will have other films and videos, though.  A slide show, maybe... so if you have some good pictures of Roger, send jpegs to me or Trent.  Artwork too.  Most of the evening will be taken up with readings from Roger's work: his poems, his stories, favorite passages from his books.  We expect there will be tears; we hope there will be laughter too.  And Roger's own voice will be heard: he recorded the Amber audiobooks himself, and we hope to play some of that.\r\n\r\nThe evening's final offering will be a play.  If you're read my memorial, above, you'll know that one of the last things Roger ever completed was a short musical play called GODSON.  He read it aloud in my living room a few weeks before he died, but to my knowledge it has never been staged or performed.  Until now.  \r\n\r\nGODSON will have its long LONG awaited premiere on the stage of the Jean Cocteau on May 31.  Its the story of what happens when Death adopts a child, and it's pure Roger.  We are in rehearsal now.  Advance tickets for the evening will be on sale shortly; watch this space for announcements.  All box office proceeds will be split with the Zelazny family and the actors and director who are bringing us GODSON.  The Cocteau has only 130 seats, so if you want to be part of this, do not hesitate when tickets are made available.  This is a one-time only event.  (Though we would consider further performances of GODSON if the play is well received and there seems to be sufficient demand.  Roger would like that, I am sure).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/248807/248807_800.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nIf you knew Roger, or even if you only knew his work, and you would like to help or be a part of this, please get in touch with Trent Z at trentzelazny@juno.com\r\n\r\nWe want to make this an evening worthy of one of greatest science fiction writers who ever lived.","ditemid":422596,"eventtime":"2015-04-23 01:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau, science fiction","current_moodid":101,"commentalter":1430978264,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Remembering Roger http://goo.gl/1YkjI8","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":5,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.630468176540498]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1429391189}","revtime":1431545244},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-18 21:06:15","anum":196,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html","event_timestamp":1429751460,"reply_count":54,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/110688070/38246362","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21323972#t21323972","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21323972#t21323972","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21323972#t21323972","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21323972#t21323972","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ckovacs","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ckovacs.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21323972,"talkid":83296,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21323972#t21323972","article":"The Cocteau performance will be the third one, to the best of my knowledge.<br /><br />The Godson musical was first performed at Boskone in 2010, with music by David Grubbs to support the lyrics of the songs Roger had written.

My first brush with Hollywood magic, and I could not wait for the movie to come out. To say I was bitterly disappointed with the film came out is a massive understatement (the only other film to let me down more was \"Doc Savage\" - broke my tender 13 year old heart...), but I suppose Zelazny was even more bummed about it than I was. Still, the anticipation of the movie introduced me to his writing and I love it for that reason, along with memories of a great day out in the desert. <br />While y'all are honoring Zelazny's life, I think I'll curl up and re-read \"Lord of Light\" - I can still remember the rush of reading that for the first time.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 19 2015, 01:16:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/bob.jenson","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Bob Jenson","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2119687","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=65925132&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Bob Jenson","ctime_ts":1429406170,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/84595103/17428707","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21350340#t21350340","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21350340#t21350340","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21350340#t21350340","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vnend","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vnend.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21350340,"talkid":83399,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21350340#t21350340","above":21336004,"upictitle":"vnend: art under the bridge","article":"If I remember what Roger wrote of his thoughts on the movie accurately, yeah, he wasn't happy with what they did to the story.

So anyway, I'm sorry I can't be there, but I will think of you all, with envy.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 19 2015, 22:54:15 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://akirlu.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"akirlu","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"akirlu","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://akirlu.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"akirlu","ctime_ts":1429484055,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93121841/19960572","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21367748#t21367748","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21367748#t21367748","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21367748#t21367748","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"windmonkey","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://windmonkey.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21367748,"talkid":83467,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21367748#t21367748","upictitle":"windmonkey: pic#93121841","article":"Shimbo Darktree: Shrugger of Thunders.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 20 2015, 00:16:10 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Best Name Ever","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://windmonkey.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"windmonkey","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"windmonkey","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://windmonkey.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"windmonkey","ctime_ts":1429488970,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124851279/75320952","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21378500#t21378500","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21378500#t21378500","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21378500#t21378500","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jfzeigler","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jfzeigler.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21378500,"talkid":83509,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/422596.html?thread=21378500#t21378500","upictitle":"Jon Zeigler: pic#124851279","article":"I had the honor of meeting Roger once, at a writer's conference in Canton, Ohio when I was just a teenager.
