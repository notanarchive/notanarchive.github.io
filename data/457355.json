{"itemid":1786,"subject":"Out in the Belt","event":"We had a great time at the Jean Cocteau yesterday.  Our world premiere of THE EXPANSE was terrific fun for all concerned, I think.   We screened the first two episodes of the series (joined seamlessly into one long two-hour film), once for the cast, crew, and VIPs, and once for the general public... and my, but the show looked great on our <s>big </s>medium-sized screen.  We also had a signing and Q&A with Jimmy Corey, aka Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham, followed by a kickass party.\r\n\r\nEveryone seemed to have a swell time... especially those, like me, who had not seen the show before (though of course I have read all the books).  Terrific performances and fine writing.  This is the show that fandom has been waiting for since FIREFLY and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA left the air... a real kickass spaceship show, done right.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, a December debut is a little late in the year for awards buzz, but if the word gets around fast enough, I think you can add THE EXPANSE to the list of shows that could (and in this case, should) compete for a Hugo nomination in Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. \r\n\r\nMy thanks to Ty and Daniel and the good folks at Alcon Television for making this happen, and to David Sidebottom, Jenni Higginbotham, Jon Bowman, and the rest of my amazing JCC staff for making the event such a smashing success.\r\n\r\nFor all of you who could not make it... be sure to catch THE EXPANSE when it debuts on December 14.","ditemid":457355,"eventtime":"2015-12-04 15:44:00","props":{"current_mood":"pleased","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, the expanse, television and film","crosspost_tw_log":"[Fri Dec  4 22:44:17 2015]R [Fri Dec  4 22:44:18 2015]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/672909318576975873 ","current_moodid":109,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1449534556,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/672909318576975873","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":2,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.681161717067895]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1449271901}","revtime":1449554096},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-12-04 22:44:15","anum":139,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html","event_timestamp":1449243840,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125650704/77139680","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23215499#t23215499","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23215499#t23215499","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23215499#t23215499","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3414687","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10205225594094611/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23215499,"talkid":90685,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23215499#t23215499","upictitle":"Chris Miracle: pic#125650704","article":"*Battlestar Galactica ;)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 4 2015, 22:56:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10205225594094611/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Chris Miracle","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3414687","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=77139680&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Chris Miracle","ctime_ts":1449269796,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23216011#t23216011","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23216011#t23216011","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23216011#t23216011","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23216011,"talkid":90687,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/457355.html?thread=23216011#t23216011","above":23215499,"upictitle":"George R.R.
