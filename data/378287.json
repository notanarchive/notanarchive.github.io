{"itemid":1477,"subject":"Six Days Left","event":"Only six days remain on my big Prizeo fundraiser on behalf of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe.&nbsp; We&#39;ve raised some $459,000 as I write, but we&#39;re still short of our half-million dollar goal.&nbsp; So if you have some spare change and/or folding green in your pocket, come help push us over the top with a late surge!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.prizeo.com/prizes/georgerrmartin/a-wolf-sanctuary-tour-and-helicopter-ride\r\n\r\nMany of the special incentive prizes have been snapped up... but some remain.\r\n\r\nYou can still book a brunch with me at San Diego Comicon, a week from Sunday.&nbsp; (Hand at the Table).\r\n\r\nYou can still buy my red flame suspenders... yes, the pair I am wearing in the avatar pic above.&nbsp; (Khaleesi).&nbsp; They&#39;re worn, but they have done good service, and I am sure many of you would look better in &#39;em than I do.\r\n\r\nAlso.. some of you may recall that Bantam Spectra changed the cover design of A FEAST FOR CROWS before the book was released, and never used the beautiful Jaime Lannister artwork that Stephen Youll had painted.&nbsp; But we have some copies of the never-used original covers, and we&#39;re offering those as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Stag)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/210022/210022_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"youll\" src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/210022/210022_900.jpg\" title=\"youll\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThese cover flats have never been used.&nbsp; A rare collectible, a few of them have turned up on ebay in recent years, sometimes with minimum bids in the thousands of dollars.&nbsp; And those are unsigned.&nbsp; Buy one for the wolves, and I&#39;ll autograph/ deface it (or not), as you please.&nbsp; And the money will go to feed the homeless and shelter the wolves... plus buying you more tickets for the grand prize.\r\n\r\nThe grand prize, of course, remains the same: a trip to Santa Fe from anywhere in the world, a day with me, and a helicopter visit down to Candy Kitchen, New Mexico to see Wild Spirit and visit the wolves.\r\n\r\nSo join in... and do watch the site closely.&nbsp; We plan to add a few more last minute incentive prizes on Wednesday, before the fundraiser closes down on Friday.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"455\" />","ditemid":378287,"eventtime":"2014-07-19 11:46:00","props":{"current_mood":"hopeful","current_location":"Santa Fe","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1406781001,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"flames","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1407030304},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-07-19 17:46:18","anum":175,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html","event_timestamp":1405770360,"reply_count":12,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124483323/36582828","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19359407#t19359407","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19359407#t19359407","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19359407#t19359407","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"insurrbution","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://insurrbution.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19359407,"talkid":75622,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19359407#t19359407","upictitle":"insurrbution: pic#124483323","article":"Not sure if you got around to reading the messages yet, but I donated not too long ago.

As it is too early for bank hours, I rechecked my statement of July 2014 and there really is an amount enough to cover and still have a balance.<br /><br />I don't know what to say anymore.  It would have been just nice to be able to help the cause no matter how little.<br /><br />I have to call my bank again when it opens.  I already done that but did not leave a message to a machine.  I want a person.<br /><br />Just so you know.<br /><br />Thanks..<br /><br />~Merela~","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"July 22 2014, 12:32:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I tried to donate..","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"13masquerade","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"13masquerade","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://13masquerade.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"13masquerade","ctime_ts":1406032351,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370159#t19370159","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370159#t19370159","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370159#t19370159","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2695867","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/109200092905916767065","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19370159,"talkid":75664,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370159#t19370159","upictitle":"Amir Akhundzadeh: pic#0","article":"Just saw that the stretch goal was met - congrats!<br /><br />I would love to donate and and get a signed AFFC dust-jacket, but $1,000 is more that I can do.<br /><br />Is there anyone I can contact to see if a lower offer for one of those would be acceptable?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"July 25 2014, 17:43:49 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"AFFC covers","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/109200092905916767065","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Amir Akhundzadeh","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2695867","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=71770084&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Amir Akhundzadeh","ctime_ts":1406310229,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117629633/50324393","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370415#t19370415","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370415#t19370415","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370415#t19370415","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1246218","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/kalmonte2","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19370415,"talkid":75665,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378287.html?thread=19370415#t19370415","upictitle":"Katherine Almonte: pic#117629633","article":"It is unbelievable that so many fans have donated so much to your project.
