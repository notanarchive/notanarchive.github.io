The trailers look promising, and to me it seems like this film is a return to the Reservoir Dogs formula, and that can't be a bad thing.<br /><br />P.S.: As other people have recommended, you should go see the new Star Wars film. Personally I think that it's the third best film of the franchise, after Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope.<br /><br />P.S. 2: Merry Christmas to you, and to every person participating on this blog!<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 25 2015, 15:26:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://angelos-l.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"angelos_l","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"angelos_l","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://angelos-l.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"angelos_l","ctime_ts":1451057198,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?replyto=23317995","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23317995#t23317995","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23317995#t23317995","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23317995#t23317995","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"heason88","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://heason88.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23317995,"talkid":91085,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23317995#t23317995","upictitle":"Alex Chiacchieri: pic#0","article":"Is there a particular movie of his you think his best work?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"December 25 2015, 15:26:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Is there a particular movie of his you have a ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://heason88.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"heason88","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"heason88","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://heason88.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"heason88","ctime_ts":1451057201,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?replyto=23332587","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23332587#t23332587","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23332587#t23332587","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23332587#t23332587","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23332587,"talkid":91142,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/461035.html?thread=23332587#t23332587","above":23317995,"upictitle":"George R.R.
