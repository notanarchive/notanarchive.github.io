{"itemid":1653,"subject":"Fanageddon","event":"The membership numbers for Sasquan continue to climb higher and higher.  In the past, worldcons in major metropolitan areas like LA, Chicago, Boston, and London have boasted the largest membership numbers, while those in smaller and more out-of-the way locales have been smaller.  Spokane is about as small and out-of-the-way as worldcon sites are like to get, and therefore might reasonably have been expected to be one of the smaller worldcons in the past decade.\r\n\r\nBut this is no ordinary year.  Thanks to Puppygate and the Hugo War, Sasquan's membership numbers are way higher than anyone could have expected.  The little con in Spokane even has an outside chance of eclipsing the record membership totals set last year by London.\r\n\r\nFILE 770 has the numbers:  http://file770.com/?p=22097\r\n\r\nWhat's even more unusual -- though perfectly understandable in context -- is that this huge upswell is for SUPPORTING memberships, not attending.  In other words, these are people who want to vote on the Hugo Awards, but have no actual interest in attending the worldcon.  \r\n\r\nBut who are they?  Are these new members Sad Puppy fans, signing up to vote the Torgersen/ Correia slate to victory?  Are these the Rabids, the lockstep legions of Vox Day?  Or is this fandom, gathering to defend the integrity of the Hugos?  Pronouncements abound, but no one really knows, and no one is likely to know until the envelopes are opened.  This will be the most dramatic Hugo night in worldcon history.  But not in a good way.\r\n\r\nMyself, I think it's All of the Above.  Fans on both sides -- or all three sides, if you want to draw a line between the Sad Puppies and the Rabids -- are laying down their money to cast their vote.  I also think the votes may be way closer than some of the people on \"my side\" think.  I am sensing way too much complacency from fandom.  The Puppies dominated the nominations by mustering 200-300 votes for their slate, out of 2000; the fans seem to be counting on the \"other\" 1800, the voters who scattered their own nominating ballots, to outvote the Pups.  And yes, 1800 beats 200 every time... but that does NOT account for all these new members.\r\n\r\nHowever this goes down, we will see more Hugo ballots cast than ever before.  If any of this matters to you -- yes, YOU, reading this right now -- you can and should cast one of them.  It will cost you $40, and you have until July 1 to sign up.  Go to:\r\n\r\n                           https://sasquan.swoc.us/sasquan/reg.php\r\n\r\nLooking at those membership numbers, especially the number of Supporting Members as opposed to Attending, makes me wonder -- are any of the Puppies actually planning on coming to Sasquan?  If their slate should prevail and win a bunch of rockets, who is going to be there to accept them?  We know Brad Torgersen cannot attend, since he is being deployed.  I believe that Larry Correia had also stated that he won't be going.  So... who will?","ditemid":423221,"eventtime":"2015-04-24 17:11:00","props":{"current_mood":"anxious","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":4,"commentalter":1430280693,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Fanageddon http://goo.gl/DFZNDn","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.685070955490932]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1429917101}","revtime":1430281848},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-24 23:10:46","anum":53,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html","event_timestamp":1429895460,"reply_count":108,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116029988/46432551","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21431861#t21431861","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21431861#t21431861","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21431861#t21431861","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"n_overstreet","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://n-overstreet.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21431861,"talkid":83718,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21431861#t21431861","upictitle":"NigelOverstreet: pic#116029988","article":"And from that day forth, the Maesters dubbed it The War of the Three Fandoms.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 24 2015, 23:19:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://n-overstreet.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"n_overstreet","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"n_overstreet","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://n-overstreet.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"n_overstreet","ctime_ts":1429917571,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/94350633/157701","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21432373#t21432373","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21432373#t21432373","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21432373#t21432373","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21432373#t21432373","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jenbooks","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jenbooks.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21432373,"talkid":83720,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21432373#t21432373","upictitle":"Jen: bucky get out much","article":"I went to my first world con in San Antonio, and was gleefully surprised about the Hugo Packet.

On the other hand the method for choosing the academy award winners or the grammy's are pretty lame too, and internet voting is hardly accurate due to bots.  And a secret panel of judges doesn't always work since there can be corruption in that too (see IGF for a great example of that.)  <br /><br />But hopefully the whole thing sorts itself out and the right people win some awards.  I'm obviously not a part of \"The Fandom\" but I'm a fan of SF and fantasy, and I've followed the Hugo Awards for about a decade.  I always assumed a council of elders selected the winners based on merit, not an election.

If you want to distinguish between those you share your views and those who disagree why not use the term truefan(as that already has a definition which is generally similar to yours) or capitalize the word as Fandom to distinguish those who agree with you on the issue and those who disagree but are still fans of the genre. Appropriating the word fandom is not only inaccurate but hurtful to not only many fans of the genre generally but to those who are specifically fans of your works while disagreeing with your political views generally or specifically on the Puppygate issue. I believe your use of fandom has the effect of delegitimizing and alianatng that portion of your fandom that disagrees with you on Puppygate. <br /><br />P.S. I feel a special kinship to you as I was raised not far from Bayonne and spent much of my summers in my youth at the Bayonne pool. However, I am mortified that you are a Mets fan. As someone raised in New Jersey I can categorically state that \"It Is Known\" that the only acceptable options are the Old Brooklyn Dodgers, the Old New York Giants, or if you have turned to the dark side as myself the New York Yankees.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 25 2015, 04:19:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Use of the word fandom","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://unclfester.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"unclfester","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"unclfester","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://unclfester.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"unclfester","ctime_ts":1429935597,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21442613#t21442613","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21442613#t21442613","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21442613#t21442613","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21442613,"talkid":83760,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21442613#t21442613","above":21441589,"upictitle":"George R.R.

I didnt even heard of Puppygate until a week ago (and other fans in Germany have the same problem), lewt alone that we understand it. I dont know how many people outside the US know which author/publisher belongs to wich party or owns a gunshop or a head shop or whatever... (i havent even heard of Vox Day)<br /><br />But anyway, since the Sad puppys somewhat distanced themselves from the angry ones and in the last post they claimed that anyone can nominate (and I think thats sincere) I see three different outcomes:<br />1. Everyone can nominate next year on the puppy slate and much more people participate and its a great succes. It will be continued and the Worldconpeople decide to reach out more (?) and the Hugos will change for the better. That is what the sad puppys saying they want to archieve. <br />2. Everyone can nominate but the attendance and the results are not that much different than without the slate. The whole movement somehow looses momentum - in one moment they had their own slate in the next, they just use the normalnomination process in a slightly different way. The Sad Puppy slates fizzle out over the years to become a footnote in ten years time. This is what I would expect to happen if not for outcome number 3:<br />3. Everyone can nominate and as a result Rubina Gomolka, the black, gay, atheistian (is that a word?) author from Russia, who is a close friend of John Scalzi and writes about gender roles in a great commuinst future,  is sweeping the board with her tremendous work. The rabid puppys are notr amused and calling the sad puppies \"traitors\", \"turncoats\" and \"pushovers\" and will continue to destroy the hugos with No Votes. Some sad puppies will agree that this isnt the outcome they originally bargained for and splinter groups are formed. The Hugo will becomne a battlefield for a fan-civil-war about the futile question who reads the \"right\" work.<br /><br />The problem is: In the moment you dived fans into \"right\" and \"wrong\" you discover that you start to fracture the fanbase.

Such terms may emerge... and people who don't like clear, precise thought are going to keep muddying the waters.<br /><br />I am a Supporting Member. I am not a trufan, nor a fannish fan. I would rather eat maggots than study the Worldcon list of acronyms and in-jokes. I'm in for the vote, and not for the \"community\".<br /><br />If Worldcon considers that a contradiction, then Worldcon has some decisions to make. When the rules on paper don't match the reality in practice, then it's time for one or both to change, until they match. There's a proposal to make supporting memberships (in future years) only available to those who have previously attended the meatspace face-to-face Worldcon gathering. That would accomplish certain goals; whether those are the True Goals of Worldcon is beyond my ken.<br /><br />One can say that the divisions are the Sad Puppies, the Rabid Puppies, and the Puppy Kickers. Are those the only three categories worth articulating? That mapping puts me and the Neilsen Haydens in the same box; would they agree on the accuracy and completeness of a mapping which lumps them with a zealously non-fannish fan such as myself?<br /><br />Slytherin House defined itself as the House for those with cleverness and ambition. It also defined itself as the House of the purebloods. Eventually those two definitions came into conflict. Same may happen for Worldcon: a commitment to define group identity by background, such as purebloods or trufans, will sooner or later come into conflict with any other benchmark of group identity.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"April 25 2015, 07:06:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"shades of fandom","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://riley37.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"riley37","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"riley37","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://riley37.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"riley37","ctime_ts":1429945601,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21446453#t21446453","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21446453#t21446453","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21446453#t21446453","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21446453#t21446453","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21446453,"talkid":83775,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/423221.html?thread=21446453#t21446453","above":21443381,"upictitle":"George R.R.
