{"itemid":1828,"subject":"Playoff Football","event":"The NFL playoffs are in full swing, and of course as a football fan, I watch them.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to confess, since neither the Jets nor the Giants are involved, I don't watch them with the same level of attention that I do when one of my teams is playing.  I often work while watching... going over a copyedited manuscript, paying bills, balancing my checkbook, whatever.  When something exciting happens, I can always rewind to watch what I missed.  The wonders of having TIVO (I do love my TIVO).\r\n\r\nSo I really don't have much to say about this weekend's contests.  Except...\r\n\r\nThe Patriots won.  Bummed me out.  Boring game too.  I expected more of the Chiefs.  \r\n\r\nThe Broncos won.  No surprise, but that one was closer than I expected.  Given the losses the Steelers have suffered, I thought it might be a blowout, but Pittsburgh hung in there gallantly.  I have a lot of respect for the Steelers.  The Rooneys, like the Maras, are one of the class ownerships in the NFL.  I was glad to see Peyton advance, though.  Can't help but hope he ends his career with another ring.  But first he needs to beat Brady and Evil Little Bill.\r\n\r\nThe Carolina / Seattle game was strange.  Almost a repeat of the Giants game against Carolina during the regular season, minus the Beckham/ Norman war.  Complete domination by Carolina in the first half, during which they built up a 31 - 0 lead.  In the second half, they don't show up.  Almost blew that one, just as they almost blew the Giants game.  Someone needs to tell the Panthers that NFL games last 60 minutes, not 30.\r\n\r\nAs for the Green Bay/ Arizona game... words fail me.  That game was insane.  Especially the ending.  Discount Doublecheck indeed... Aaron Rodgers made what were essentially TWO Hail Marys to move from his own endzone to a TD.  I have never seen anything like it.  Impossible, really.  And then came the overtime coin toss, and the <i><b>bloody coin doesn't flip</b></i>.  Plainly eldritch forces were at work.  The end, with Larry the Fitz taking it over, was amazing and exciting and, I think, satisfying for any football fan not from Wisconsin.  But hey, a great game, if a crazy one.  I am glad neither of my teams was involved.  Those last ten minutes would have killed me.","ditemid":468209,"eventtime":"2016-01-17 22:26:00","props":{"current_mood":"indifferent","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jan 18 05:26:24 2016]R [Mon Jan 18 05:26:26 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/688955586281517056 ","current_moodid":65,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1453754425,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/688955586281517056","picture_keyword":"Ashford","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.705639773245763]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1453094840}","revtime":1453754411},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-18 05:26:22","anum":241,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468209.html","event_timestamp":1453069560,"reply_count":50,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125878916/77259760","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468209.html?thread=23892977#t23892977","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468209.html?thread=23892977#t23892977","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468209.html?thread=23892977#t23892977","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468209.html?thread=23892977#t23892977","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"writing_mombie","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://writing-mombie.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23892977,"talkid":93331,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/468209.html?thread=23892977#t23892977","upictitle":"Writing_Mombie: turtle","article":"I don't know anything about Football, but reading your blog always makes me curious (since in general, I like watchings sports events like soccer, skiing ..) :D Maybe I'll have a look into it, just wouldn't know where or how to start (since I don't even know the rules)...
