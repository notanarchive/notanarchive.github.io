{"itemid":620,"subject":"Another GOT Hire","event":"Everyone is all in a frenzy for casting news, I know, I know... but it takes a lot of talent to make quality television and film, and not all of that talent is in front of the cameras.  \r\n\r\nDavid Benioff and Dan Weiss and the good folks at HBO have been assembling a terrific team for GAME OF THRONES.  I thought you all might like to hear about one of the latest hires come aboard -- world-class makeup artist PAUL ENGELEN has signed up to do the hair and makeup design for our series.\r\n\r\nYou may or may not have heard of Mr. Engelen before, but if you've seen a TV show or a film in the last couple of decades, you have certainly seen his work.  His credits include Ridley Scott's recent ROBIN HOOD, Narnia, CASINO ROYALE, V FOR VENDETTA, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, TROY, GLADIATOR, James Bond, Tarzan, A FISH CALLED WANDA, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS... oh, and something called STAR WARS too.\r\n\r\nOh, and he's been nominated twice for the Academy Award for best makeup, and five times for a BAFTA.  Won one of the latter, too.\r\n\r\nHe's a exciting addition to the GAME OF THRONES team, and we're all thrilled to have him on board.","ditemid":158909,"eventtime":"2010-06-25 13:38:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":41,"commentalter":1279144509,"picture_keyword":"ireland","personifi_word_count":213,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"8:4,41:10,11:6,30:6,43:4,42:8,3:43,19:4,25:27,4:29,26:10,9:10,13:6,nterms:yes","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-06-25 19:38:14","anum":189,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/158909.html","event_timestamp":1277473080,"reply_count":21,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/95296252/17073121","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/158909.html?replyto=10368445","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/158909.html?thread=10368445#t10368445","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/158909.html?thread=10368445#t10368445","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/158909.html?thread=10368445#t10368445","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"maine_character","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://maine-character.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10368445,"talkid":40501,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/158909.html?thread=10368445#t10368445","upictitle":"maine_character: pic#95296252","article":"Quality work always rocks.
