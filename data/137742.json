{"itemid":538,"subject":"Off Season","event":"Like rust, the NFL never sleeps.\r\n\r\nThe offseason is already in full swing, and the Jets just acquired Antonio Cromartie from the Chargers for a third-round draft pick... in 2011!  Wow.  Sounds like a great deal to me.  Cromartie is a first round talent, led the league in interceptions just a few years ago.  And paired with Darrell Revis, he'll give Gang Green the best CB tandem in the league... which should make our #1 ranked defense even better.  (We'll get Kris Jenkins back as well).\r\n\r\nHey, maybe nobody will EVER score on us next season.\r\n\r\nSo now all we need is a stud pass-rusher and sack artist.

Because of the lack of an agreement in place this offseason the \"Final 4\" teams have big limits on the number of FAs they can sign, and the $$ they can offer.  I do hope Sharper comes back (9 INTS this year, 3 pick 6's!!).<br /><br />I'm looking for most of the 13 tendered RFAs to be resigned except for Left Tackle. We have 3 quality guys and one will likely be traded for draft pick(s).<br /><br />But I expect our GM (Mickey Loomis) to do very well in the draft - that's how we'll reload for the repeat!!!<br /><br />Good luck to the Jets and Giants - I follow both NY teams - gotta support our homeboy Eli!!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"March 6 2010, 04:43:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"GEAUX SAINTS!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wunsasaint.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wunsasaint","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wunsasaint","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wunsasaint.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wunsasaint","ctime_ts":1267850633,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/18749865/695364","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/137742.html?replyto=9136910","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/137742.html?thread=9136910#t9136910","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/137742.html?thread=9136910#t9136910","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/137742.html?thread=9136910#t9136910","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"olde_scratch","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://olde-scratch.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9136910,"talkid":35691,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/137742.html?thread=9136910#t9136910","above":9135118,"upictitle":"Scratch: arrr","article":"For years I second guessed and would yell and scream at our front office.
