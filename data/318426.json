{"itemid":1243,"subject":"Wildfire v. The Doctor","event":"GAME OF THRONES will be taking on The Doctor this year in the Hugos... and FRINGE as well.\r\n\r\nLoneStarCon 3 just announced this year's Hugo nominations.  \"Blackwater,\" the ninth episode of the second season, has been nominated in Best Dramatic Presentation - Short Form.  That was the episode with the wildfire and the big battle, I am sure you all recall, written by yours truly (with considerable help from showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who added one of the shows's best original scenes) and directed by Neil Marshall.  We'll be up against an episode of FRINGE, and no less than three episodes of DOCTOR WHO, which has owned the Short Form category for most of the past decade.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/164319/164319_300.jpg\" alt=\"Blackwater-Game-of-Thrones\" title=\"Blackwater-Game-of-Thrones\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" />\r\n\r\nThe full list of nominees can be found at:\r\n\r\n http://www.lonestarcon3.org/hugo-awards/index.shtml\r\n\r\nThe Short Form finalists:\r\nDoctor Who:\"The Angels Take Manhattan\" Written by Steven Moffat, Directed by Nick Hurran (BBC Wales)\r\nDoctor Who:\"Asylum of the Daleks\" Written by Steven Moffat; Directed by Nick Hurran (BBC Wales)\r\nDoctor Who:\"The Snowmen\" Written by Steven Moffat, Directed by Saul Metzstein (BBC Wales)\r\nFringe:\"Letters of Transit\" Written by J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Akiva Goldsman, J.H.Wyman, Jeff Pinkner. Directed by Joe Chappelle (Fox)\r\nGame of Thrones:\"Blackwater\" Written by George R.R. Martin, Directed by Neil Marshall. Created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (HBO)  \r\n\r\nThanks to all those who sent in nominations, whether you nominated us, or someone else.  As I have said time and time again, the nominations are in many ways the most crucial part of the process.\r\n\r\nShould be an interesting contest. I haven't seen any of the last season of DR. WHO, so I don't know which of those episodes is the strongest contender... but the Whofans are many and formidable, so I figure we are rather a long shot to upset the Doctor's applecart.  I know even less about FRINGE.  But hey, you pays your money and you takes your pick, and the Hugos fall where they may.\r\n\r\nCongratulations to all the other nominees, and my thanks to David, Dan, Bryan, Neil, and all the rest of the great cast and crew who make HBO's GAME OF THRONES the hit it is.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/163904/163904_300.jpg\" alt=\"wildfireblackwatergot9\" title=\"wildfireblackwatergot9\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" />","ditemid":318426,"eventtime":"2013-03-30 15:51:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards","current_moodid":109,"commentalter":1365918357,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1366243620},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-03-30 21:51:28","anum":218,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/318426.html","event_timestamp":1364658660,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120471398/62339920","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/318426.html?thread=17482970#t17482970","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/318426.html?thread=17482970#t17482970","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/318426.html?thread=17482970#t17482970","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1728909","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/eric.heimann.75","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17482970,"talkid":68292,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/318426.html?thread=17482970#t17482970","upictitle":"Eric Heimann: pic#120471398","article":"Congratulations!!!

While there have been episodes with great moments they always seemed to be mixed with so much stuff that doesn't even make any sense to make it a wash.  \"The Doctor's Wife\", last year's winner, was a good episode, but better than \"Baelor\"?  Not hardly.<br /><br />The Fringe episode is noteworthy for taking a huge step outside the box and just throwing the viewer into the future of the story with new characters without any explanation.  I like it because it expected much more of the viewer than most everything else on tv, which is also how I reacted to the first episode of a certain series on HBO.  But I guess my perception of it is now colored by having completely lost interest in that future story in the next season.<br /><br />So having \"Blackwater\" actually nominated, better luck next year, Doctor.
