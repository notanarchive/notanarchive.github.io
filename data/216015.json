{"itemid":843,"subject":"Lament for Lady","event":"... well, sort of.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that a number of television viewers (mostly those who had not read my books and did not know what was coming)were shocked and upset by what befell Sansa's direwolf Lady at the end of the second episode of HBO's GAME OF THRONES.\r\n\r\nGood.  I mean, that was kind of the point.  \r\n\r\nBut some people were reportedly so shocked and upset that they wrote angry blogs about it, and even declared that they would not continue watching the show.\r\n\r\nNot so good.  Obviously, I'm sorry to hear that.\r\n\r\nI don't know if any of those people are reading my Not A Blog.  But in case they are, perhaps it will make you feel a little better to know that Zunni, the Northern Inuit who played Lady, is alive and well, and has been adopted by Sophie Turner, the lovely young actress who plays Sansa in the show.  We didn't really kill her.  \r\n\r\n(Rhodri Hosking, the young actor who played the butcher's boy Mycah, was not actually killed either, though oddly, no one seems quite so upset about him).\r\n\r\nReal wolves and wolf-hybrids are being killed every day in the real world, however.  If you love wolves, and were upset at Lady's death, why not try to help some real wolves?\r\n\r\nThere's some great folks right in Candy Kitchen, New Mexico who do just that (yes, New Mexico has a Candy Kitchen.  We also have a Pietown and a Truth Or Consequences.  Three reasons I love this state).  \r\n\r\nThey're called the Wild Spirit Wolf Sancturary, and they rescue wolves and wolf-hybrids.  You can learn all about them from their website, here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/ \r\n\r\nYears ago, for Christmas, the fans of the Brotherhood Without Banners sponsored a wolf in Parris's name, and made her a \"wolf mother.\"   \r\n\r\nSo shed no tears for Lady... but if you have a spare buck or two, send it to Wild Spirit in her name, and you might help save a real wolf or three.","ditemid":216015,"eventtime":"2011-05-13 00:34:00","props":{"taglist":"wolves, good causes","commentalter":1358531569,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"sad baby","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1306015537},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-05-16 06:34:38","anum":207,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216015.html","event_timestamp":1305246840,"reply_count":148,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/104492566/10818948","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216015.html?thread=13489615#t13489615","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216015.html?thread=13489615#t13489615","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216015.html?thread=13489615#t13489615","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216015.html?thread=13489615#t13489615","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"oncloud999","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://oncloud999.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13489615,"talkid":52693,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/216015.html?thread=13489615#t13489615","upictitle":"Oncloud999: key umbrella","article":"Oh dear.
