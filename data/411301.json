{"itemid":1606,"subject":"Revis Returns!!!","event":"After two years in exile, the best cornerback in the NFL is finally returning to the New York Jets.\r\n\r\nIt has been a long long time since fans of Gang Green had anything to celebrate, but the return of Darrelle Revis is definitely cause for a smile.\r\n\r\nOf course, he should never have left. See my Not A Blog post of April 21, 2013. I said it all then: trading away the Jets best cause was sufficient cause for dumping our then-new GM, John Idzik. Time has proved me right. Now Idzik is gone and Darelle is back. It only cost us two years, two lost seasons, and a great coach, Rex Ryan.\r\n\r\nWill Darrelle&#39;s return make the Jets a contender?\r\n\r\nWell, one can dream... but I think it unlikely, unless it turns out Revis can also play quarterback. So long as we have Geno Smith and the Pats have Tom Brady, I can&#39;t see the Jets contending for the AFC East.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the NFL... well, the Giants are looking better and better as well. Not because of anything they have done, but because of what&#39;s happening down in Philadelphia, where Chip Kelly seems to be systemically dismantling the Eagles. Hey, keep at it, Chip.","ditemid":411301,"eventtime":"2015-03-11 14:35:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1426615472,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Revis Returns!!! http://j.mp/1NLjam7","picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.668197487121814]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1426643731}","revtime":1426643695},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-03-11 20:33:41","anum":165,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/411301.html","event_timestamp":1426084500,"reply_count":26,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123414693/71027746","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/411301.html?thread=20356005#t20356005","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/411301.html?thread=20356005#t20356005","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/411301.html?thread=20356005#t20356005","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2604874","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/LaceUpBearDown","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":20356005,"talkid":79515,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/411301.html?thread=20356005#t20356005","upictitle":"Dan K: pic#123414693","article":"Your Jets and my Bears also made a trade recently!
