That last interception in overtime.  *headdesk*  I was also getting crabby that they kept calling screens.  They obviously weren't working so why were we running them.  I think some of it was the cold.  Back in the Early 1990's I was always saying,\"When that Favre guy settles in and stops throwing all those interceptions he's going to be really good.\" Here we are like 16 years later.  OY!<br /><br />The think that impressed me the most was that the Eli hasn't had any interceptions in the post season.  He did a great job with his team today.  They all played well.  <br /><br />I'll be pulling for the Giants to win this SuperBowl too.   Sooner or later the Pats have to lose.  Now is as good a time as any.  :)  ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"January 21 2008, 06:33:36 UTC","parent":3214392,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: great game","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://wolfden.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"wolfden","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"wolfden","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://wolfden.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"wolfden","ctime_ts":"1200897216","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3235384#t3235384","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3235384#t3235384","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3235384#t3235384","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"secret_tgirl","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://secret-tgirl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3235384,"talkid":12638,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3235384#t3235384","above":3219000,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","parent":3219000,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: great game","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://secret-tgirl.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"secret_tgirl","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"secret_tgirl","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://secret-tgirl.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"secret_tgirl","ctime_ts":"1200936061","leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?replyto=3214648","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3214648#t3214648","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3214648#t3214648","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3214648#t3214648","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3214648#t3214648","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ibnobody","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ibnobody.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3214648,"talkid":12557,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3214648#t3214648","upictitle":"IBNobody: pic#0","article":"What goes around, comes around.

Plaxico Burress made Al Harris look like a high school cornerback.  I hope this isn't it for Brett. The way this team is coming along I'd love to see him come back one more year.  This feeling sucks. It's not as bad as losing the Super Bowl in 98, but it's pretty freakin close. Good luck Giants, it's up to you to stop this evil juggernaut in New England.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"January 21 2008, 07:34:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"WHY!!!!!!!!!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sandors-sword.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sandors_sword","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sandors_sword","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sandors-sword.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sandors_sword","ctime_ts":"1200900842","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/75347479/4786606","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?replyto=3221048","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221048#t3221048","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221048#t3221048","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221048#t3221048","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"kitsuneka","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://kitsuneka.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3221048,"talkid":12582,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221048#t3221048","upictitle":"Kitsuneka: pic#75347479","article":"Yay!<br /><br />*also feels a little bad for Favre*","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"January 21 2008, 07:36:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://kitsuneka.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"kitsuneka","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"kitsuneka","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://kitsuneka.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"kitsuneka","ctime_ts":"1200901001","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/94114563/8940309","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?replyto=3221304","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221304#t3221304","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221304#t3221304","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221304#t3221304","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bojojoti","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bojojoti.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3221304,"talkid":12583,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/32312.html?thread=3221304#t3221304","upictitle":"bojojoti: Magic Camera","article":"I'm happy for you!
