{"itemid":962,"subject":"Whew!","event":"The Giants win another one... but just barely, by the skin of their teeth, and against the lowly winless Dolphins (sorry, Janice, but your new owner was a fool to let the Tuna go).\r\n\r\nWinning these close games certainly beats losing these close games, but just once I'd like to see the G-Men blow out one of these supposedly \"weaker\" teams, so I don't have to gnaw my knuckles in the final minute of the game, as the clock winds down.  Parris keeps threatening to buy one of those home defibrollators.  Maybe she should.  One of these weeks the Giants or Jets are going to kill me, I swear.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Eli looked great this week, as did his WRs.  Good games from Manningham and Nicks, and this new tight end, Ballard, is making me forget all about Kevin Boss.  And Victor Cruz... that kid's a keeper.  Great catch and run today for the winning score.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the running game looked awful, especially when Ahmed Bradshaw went out.  I know Brandon Jacobs is just coming off an injury, but boy, did he look bad out there today.  I breathed a huge sigh of relief when Ahmed came back in.  The defense sputtered badly in the first half, letting the Fins convert one third and long after another, but they stepped it up second half, shutting down the Miami O.  And once the G-Men finally took the lead they turned into the Big Blue defense I remember.  Great play by Corey Webster as CB, and of course the pass rush remains outstanding.\r\n \r\nSo now the Giants are 5-2, solidly in the lead in the NFC East.  I wish I could say I feel optimistic about their chances going forward, but I don't.  They've been winning, but not nearly as convincingly as I'd like, just barely squeaking by against one weak team after another (and LOSING to the Seahawks!)  And Miami was the last soft spot on their schedule.  Next week they enter their midseason meatgrinder.  If they want to keep winning, they are really going to need to step it up... not just one notch, but three or four.","ditemid":246371,"eventtime":"2011-10-30 18:07:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","commentalter":1320181614,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1320182967},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-10-31 00:07:24","anum":99,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html","event_timestamp":1319998020,"reply_count":24,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/67737483/14157613","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895715#t14895715","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895715#t14895715","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895715#t14895715","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"littleonionz","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://littleonionz.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14895715,"talkid":58186,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895715#t14895715","article":"The Dolphins managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. /close.","upictitle":"littleonionz: pic#67737483","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"5 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"October 31 2011, 00:19:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://littleonionz.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"littleonionz","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"littleonionz","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://littleonionz.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"littleonionz","ctime_ts":1320020397,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/93723244/10852549","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895971#t14895971","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895971#t14895971","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895971#t14895971","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dmedicus","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dmedicus.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14895971,"talkid":58187,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/246371.html?thread=14895971#t14895971","upictitle":"Dmedicus: Dolphins","article":"Actually we knew the Tuna was going before the sell.
