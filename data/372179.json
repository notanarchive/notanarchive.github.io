Of course, as with the novels, \"the tale(s) grew in the telling,\" and I ended up adding a LOT... so much that in the end we had to rip out more than two hundred thousand words of it (which will eventually appear in the GRRMarillion).  In the cases where I wrote way, way, way too much, Elio and Linda then went back in and produced a severely abridged version.<br /><br />For instance, the full account of the Dance of the Dragons ran to 80,000 words, a novel all by itself.  Gardner Dozois trimmed that to 30,000 words for DANGEROUS WOMEN, producing \"The Princess and the Queen.\"  Elio and Linda produced an entirely DIFFERENT abridgement (even shorter, I believe) for THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE, working from the same text.

The Battle at Volon Therys in particular was cool... like something out of old school Heroes of Might and Magic III. Love it when there's something that can beat dragons other than other dragons... the dragon trump card is not my favorite so I enjoy seeing when something else can win the day. In this case, the water magic... so... seeing as magic is returning to the world might we be seeing this sort of water magic any time in the present series? What about other non fire based elemental magics (as someone above asked about air magic, or Earth magics)?<br /><br />Also it was interesting to read about the Rhoynish archers taking down two dragons and sending another to flight. I'm curious if you might be able to comment on what made the Rhoynish archers so effective. Like what sort of draw power or anti dragon arrowheads made them so effective? I don't recall any other stories where archers proved very effective against dragons, even when used en masse and with armor piercing heads shot from Yew Longbows... which in our history ranged in power from 80 pound to and exceeding 180 pounds with 110 a common draw weight. So yeah... what made their archers work so well against the Dragons?<br /><br />And since I have this opportunity and since we are on the subject of archery there is a thing I have been wondering since book one: Yew Longbows of medieval England and Wales are the strongest bows in human history with the aforementioned 80 to 180 (or more to 200 speculated) pound draw range which seems to be the limit of human draw power, I myself have shot such a bow at 120 pounds of draw (and would be happy to share pics :D ). So what makes the goldenwood longbows of the Summer Isles superior to Yew Longbows if Yew longbows have draws at the limits of human strength? And then... what makes dragonbone bows superior to them both as well? I don't imagine it's a higher draw because then no one would be able to pull them... but I am eager to know what makes them so awesome :) Thank you.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 24 2014, 05:40:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Return of Magic and Effective Archers","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gehrig.jon","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gehrig JonLou","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2565121","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70603342&t=I","alias":0}],"etime":"May 24 2014, 05:50:40 UTC","dname":"Gehrig JonLou","ctime_ts":1400910053,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123410783/71012954","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/372179.html?thread=19162067#t19162067","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/372179.html?thread=19162067#t19162067","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/372179.html?thread=19162067#t19162067","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/372179.html?thread=19162067#t19162067","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2602688","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/pacnic22","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19162067,"talkid":74851,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/372179.html?thread=19162067#t19162067","upictitle":"Theron: pic#123410783","article":"Hello, George.<br />I've always been curious about the historical source material that influences \"Song of Ice and Fire.\"<br />Though I realize there are many different historical records that influenced your work, I'd like to ask about one particular source from Ancient China, \"The Romance of the 3 Kingdoms\"<br />It could be pure coincidence, but when I read the synopsis for \"The Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", -- I apologize for not reading the original, or knowing Chinese for that matter -- I immediately thought about some of the politics that are used as plot devices of a similar manner in your stories.
