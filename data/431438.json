{"itemid":1685,"subject":"Back In The USA","event":"So we're back home in Santa Fe, after ten days on the road in Germany, Sweden, and Finland.\r\n\r\nA wonderful trip, all in all.  Yes, much of it was work... I did numerous interviews in Hamburg, more in Stockholm, still more on the Alands, yadda yadda yadda... but in between we had some fine old times.  \r\n\r\nSome highlights:\r\n     -- touring MiniatureLand in Hamburg.  Wow.  Biggest toy train set in the world, but the landscapes and miniatures dwarf the trains.  Very glad my hosts took me to see this.\r\n     -- the big public event in Hamburg, 3000 fans, sold out months ago.\r\n     -- hanging with Sibel Kekilli and her boyfriend, and my German publicist, Sebastian.  Sibel fed me Turkish food and showed me some of Hamburg's nightlife, to reciprocate for the tour of Santa Fe I gave her on INTO THE NIGHT.  Hamburg stays up later than Santa Fe, you will be surprised to learn, but chile con queso is nowhere to be found.  We drank White Russians while huddled under blankets in an outdoor cafe.  Took a canal boat tour as well.    \r\n      -- Stockholm.  What a gorgeous city.  Comes of not having a major war since Napoleon.  That way your gorgeous old buildings don't get bombed into rubble.  \r\n      -- the Vasa Museum.  Okay, the ship never made it our of the harbor, but it makes a great centerpiece for a museum,\r\n      -- the Royal Armory, where you can actually see the bloodstained clothing that Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII were wearing when they died,\r\n      -- Marieham, on the Aland islands.  Just a lovely place.\r\n      -- the Aland Vikings, who fed us pancakes and mead and hammered at each other with axe and sword and spear for our amusement.  They are building a very cool Viking village, definitely worth a visit if you visit the islands.  \r\n\r\nAnd of course Archipelacon was great fun as well.  The Finnish fans are second to none, and we had plenty of Swedes on hand as well, and a strong BWB contigent who taught them all how to party.  It is events like this that remind me what fandom is all about -- a celebration of science fiction and fantasy, of friendship and family.","ditemid":431438,"eventtime":"2015-07-02 13:09:00","props":{"current_mood":"happy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"friends, travels, conventions","current_moodid":15,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1436289454,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"Back In The USA http://goo.gl/Sdq8cK","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.615928702768216]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1435864155}","revtime":1436287282},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-07-02 19:08:48","anum":78,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431438.html","event_timestamp":1435842540,"reply_count":78,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123518620/71197148","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431438.html?thread=21880910#t21880910","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431438.html?thread=21880910#t21880910","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431438.html?thread=21880910#t21880910","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ssalem3","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ssalem3.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21880910,"talkid":85472,"etime_ts":"1435865065","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/431438.html?thread=21880910#t21880910","upictitle":"ssalem3: pic#123518620","article":"Come here big guy, group hug. <br /><br />On a side note, you have a big Iranian fan base George!

I was thinking that doing the latter might end up helping you to come up with more interesting ways to get from point A to point B in the story than you originally intended.  Am I right?<br /><br />ALSO, I know you're sorely needed in LA where all the cinematic magic happens, but you've got tons of fans here in the North East who'd love to meet you in person!

On your comments on the beauty of Stockholm I can't help but smile! The debate has been going on for 40 years now, why one of the least war-troubled cities in the world has less historical buildings than London! The story goes.. in the 1960's and 70'ies the ruling politicians of Stockholm torn down huge chuncks of the oldest part of town, and replaced it with contemporary buildings. This was hugley controversal at the time and could problaly not have been accomplished unless the building-wreckers waited until a hot summers weekend to start their demolishing. So, the real old Stockholm wasn't destroyed by wars, but due to ideological reasons that stated that \"old buildiings are nothing but left-overs from a old (oppressive) regime not worth saving\". The new Stockholm was built on the idea that everyone should be included, which of course is a noble idea, but shouldn't be the cause of destroying our history.<br /><br />Anway! As a Swede I was happy to hear you visit my favourite museums in Stockholm! I always imagined you must have got some influence from our young boy king of the North, Carl XII, with his great military prowess and the rumors concerning he was untouchable in battle, and could only be killed with some means of magic. He was aswell killed in strange circumstances, some claim it was treachery. <br /><br />Would have loved to come to your event at Sciencefiction bokhandeln but as a true northerner I hardly like our capital :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"July 3 2015, 06:36:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Swedish history!","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10205774390297810/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Maria Kristina Ingegerd","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3212189","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76364592&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Maria Kristina Ingegerd","ctime_ts":1435905360,"tracked":0}]}
