{"itemid":771,"subject":"When the Game Began","event":"Pictures of HBO's version of the Iron Throne are all over the internet these days -- in publicity stills, in the teasers and trailers, probably as wallpaper.  Love it.\r\n\r\nI thought some of you might enjoy having a look at the FIRST Iron Throne: the one that Bantam had built as the centerpiece of their booth at the 1996 American Booksellers' Association (ABA) show in Chicago.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000e9587/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000e9587/s640x480\" width=\"333\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\nphoto copyright Andrew I. Porter\r\n\r\nThe official publication date of A GAME OF THRONES -- first edition, first printing, with its now infamous embossed silver foil cover -- was still months in the future when the 1996 ABA was held, but Bantam had hundreds of glossy hardcovers there at the show, and gave them all away to booksellers.  Which is why I have always regarded the US edition as the true first of GAME, even though the British edition from Harper Collins had an earlier official pubdate.  The American edition actually EXISTED earlier, and I handed out hundreds of them to the schools of piranha... er, retailers... who appeared out of nowhere whenever a new giveaway began.  \r\n\r\nSigned most of 'em too.  Often while sitting in the giant Iron Throne.  Which was actually made of wood, for what it's worth.  As the show was winding down, Bantam offered to let me have it, but somehow I didn't think the airline would accept it as checked baggage.\r\n\r\nBesides, the thing was really uncomfortable.  That part they got just right.","ditemid":197581,"eventtime":"2011-02-16 22:42:00","props":{"current_location":"home","taglist":"the writing life, conventions, game of thrones","commentalter":1299522958,"opt_lockcomments":1,"opt_screening":"F","interface":"web","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1299705002},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-03-02 05:42:45","anum":205,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html","event_timestamp":1297896120,"reply_count":26,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/108438397/672639","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309197#t12309197","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309197#t12309197","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309197#t12309197","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hiddenglitter","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hiddenglitter.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12309197,"talkid":48082,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309197#t12309197","article":"LOVE IT!","upictitle":"xX Kirsten Xx: Bright: Hydrangea Flowers","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"6 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"March 2 2011, 06:02:26 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://hiddenglitter.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/user_ontd.gif?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"hiddenglitter","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"hiddenglitter","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://hiddenglitter.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"hiddenglitter","ctime_ts":1299045746,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125610692/13178126","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309453#t12309453","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309453#t12309453","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309453#t12309453","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"abqlady2","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://abqlady2.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":12309453,"talkid":48083,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/197581.html?thread=12309453#t12309453","upictitle":"Abqlady2: pic#125610692","article":"Too fun.
