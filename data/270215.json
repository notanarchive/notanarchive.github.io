{"itemid":1055,"subject":"Venting","event":"Sorry, but I need to vent.\r\n\r\nI am being nibbled to death by mice.\r\n\r\nAnd this morning a elephant landed on me.\r\n\r\n*gurgle*\r\n\r\nThere are not enough hours in the day.  There are not enough days in the week.  There are not enough weeks in the year.  Sometimes it feels as if I work all day every day, only to wind up further behind by the time the sun goes down, as more mice come swarming through the cracks and more elephants come lumbering through the doors.\r\n\r\nI really really really need to learn to say No.\r\n\r\nNo, I will not come to your convention, thanks for asking.\r\n\r\nNo, I will not read your manuscript/ galley proof/ book, but good luck with that.\r\n\r\nNo, I will not write a story for your anthology, I am a year behind writing stories for my own anthologies.\r\n\r\nNo, I will not write a preface/ introduction/ foreword for your book.\r\n\r\nNo, I will not do an interview.  \r\n\r\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\r\n\r\nSuch a simple word.  Such a short word.  Why do I have such trouble uttering it?\r\n\r\nOnce I give my word to attend a con/ write a story/ do an interview, I feel honor bound to deliver, to follow through, to make good my promise.  But I give my word too often and too easily, I need to realize that.  I do, I do, I DO realize that... on an intellectual level, but maybe not in my gut.  And so while my brain is saying, \"you can't do that, you do not have the time,\" my lips are saying, \"sure, love to, sounds great.\"\r\n\r\nI need to remember my mantra.  One page at a time.  One word at a time.  One chore at a time.  You cannot do everything today.  Put out the biggest fire, the rest will still be burning tomorrow.  No.  No.  No.\r\n\r\n*sigh*\r\n\r\nThank you for listening.  This too will pass.  Tomorrow it won't seem so overwhelming.\r\n\r\nExcuse me, I need to go step on some mice.\r\n\r\nEnd of venting.","ditemid":270215,"eventtime":"2012-02-25 17:09:00","props":{"current_location":"home","taglist":"writing, everyday life, travel, editing","current_moodid":28,"commentalter":1331065378,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"space geezer","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1331144824},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-02-26 00:15:33","anum":135,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html","event_timestamp":1330189740,"reply_count":126,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/113375532/40397808","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15526535#t15526535","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15526535#t15526535","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15526535#t15526535","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"daisyberisha","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://daisyberisha.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15526535,"talkid":60650,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15526535#t15526535","upictitle":"daisyberisha: pic#113375532","article":"Just do whatever you want to do! :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"February 26 2012, 00:19:25 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"go with the flow","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://daisyberisha.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"daisyberisha","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"daisyberisha","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://daisyberisha.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"daisyberisha","ctime_ts":1330215565,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116131088/45519721","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15557767#t15557767","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15557767#t15557767","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15557767#t15557767","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"superscienceser","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://superscienceser.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15557767,"talkid":60772,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/270215.html?thread=15557767#t15557767","above":15526535,"upictitle":"superscienceser: pic#116131088","article":"Best course of action there, I certainly don't Disagree.
