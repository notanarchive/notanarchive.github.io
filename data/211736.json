{"itemid":827,"subject":"Second Season!!!","event":"Just received from HBO:\r\n\r\nHBO RENEWS GAME OF THRONES FOR SECOND SEASON\r\n\r\nLOS ANGELES, April 19, 2011 – Following strong critical and viewer response to the series’ April 17 debut, HBO has renewed GAME OF THRONES for a second season, it was announced today by Michael Lombardo, president, HBO Programming.\r\n\r\n“We are delighted by the way David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have brought George R.R. Martin’s amazing book series to the screen, and thrilled by the support of the media and our viewers,” said Lombardo.  “This is the continuation of an exciting creative partnership.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fw6d8/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fw6d8/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBased on the bestselling fantasy book series “A Song of Ice and Fire,” by George R.R. Martin, GAME OF THRONES follows kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and noblemen as they vie for power in a land where summers span decades and winters can last a lifetime.\r\n\r\nAmong the early critical raves, TV Guide has called the show “a crowning triumph” and “brilliant,” while the Los Angeles Times termed GAME OF THRONES “a great and thundering series,” as well as “wild and bewitching.”  The Hollywood Reporter praised the “excellent storytelling, superb acting and stunning visual effects,” and the New York Post observed that the “art directing, acting and incredible sets are as breathtaking as the massive scope of the series.”\r\n\r\nThe gross audience for the premiere night of GAME OF THRONES on the main HBO channel was 4.2 million viewers.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000e8tkt/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000e8tkt/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe season one cast includes (in alphabetical order):  Mark Addy, Alfie Allen, Sean Bean, Emilia Clarke, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Fairley, Aidan Gillen, Jack Gleeson, Iain Glen, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Harry Lloyd, Richard Madden, Rory McCann, Jason Momoa, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams.\r\n\r\nSeason one credits:  GAME OF THRONES is executive produced by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss; co-executive producers, Carolyn Strauss, Guymon Casady, Vince Gerardis, Ralph Vicinanza and George R.R. Martin; producers, Mark Huffam and Frank Doelger; directors of photography, Marco Pontecorvo, Alik Sakharov and Matt Jensen; production designer, Gemma Jackson; costume designer, Michele Clapton.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fxdae/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000fxdae/s640x480\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat from HBO.\r\n\r\nFrom me again:  I'm thrilled.\r\n\r\nTen more episodes!  A CLASH OF KINGS.\r\n\r\nLooks like I'll be writing the Battle of the Blackwater.  David & Dan give me the easy stuff.\r\n\r\nP.S.  A late correction.  Actually, I don't KNOW how many more episodes.  Could be ten.  Could be more.  Could even be fewer, I suppose, though I don't really think so.  Myself, I'd love to see twelve episodes this second time around, since CLASH is a hundred pages longer than GAME.  But that's a call for HBO and Dan and David, and I am sure they will let us know once it's made.","ditemid":211736,"eventtime":"2011-04-19 09:37:00","props":{"current_location":"cloud nine","taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":21,"commentalter":1304657580,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":456,"picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":4,"personifi_tags":"18:5,11:2,42:4,3:60,24:6,25:16,19:3,4:43,26:7,20:6,9:6,21:7,22:6,nterms:yes","revnum":2,"interface":"web","revtime":1304804906},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-04-19 15:37:49","anum":24,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/211736.html","event_timestamp":1303205820,"reply_count":217,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/211736.html?thread=13084440#t13084440","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/211736.html?thread=13084440#t13084440","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/211736.html?thread=13084440#t13084440","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/211736.html?thread=13084440#t13084440","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"andreadraco","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://andreadraco.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13084440,"talkid":51111,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/211736.html?thread=13084440#t13084440","upictitle":"andreadraco: pic#101807895","article":"I was hoping for more viewers...
