{"itemid":573,"subject":"Winter Is Coming... Around the Globe","event":"I've received a lot of emails from readers outside the United States, asking if the GAME OF THRONES television series will be shown in their countries.\r\n\r\nThe answer to that is complicated, and depends in large part on the country.\r\n\r\nHBO does have a number of branches, partners, subsidiaries, and affiliates abroad, who take all of their programming.  All of those will be showing the series.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the show will be seen on HBO Canada, same days and times as in the US.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Chile, the series will be shown on HBO Latin America, though days and times may vary.\r\n\r\nIn France, GAME OF THRONES will be shown on Orange.\r\n\r\nIn Israel, on DBS.\r\n\r\nHBO Central Europe will offer the series in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic.\r\n\r\nHBO Asia will offer the series to the countries in their territories, though which ones will pick it up and when they will show it remains to be confirmed.  There may be content questions in some Asian markets.\r\n\r\nIn some of these countries, HBO is a premium channel, as in the United States.  You have to sign up and subscribe to it (and pay for it), it is not one of the channels you get for free just by turning on your television.\r\n\r\nAs for the countries not listed here... next week in Cannes there will be a huge television trade show attended by broadcasters and program directors from stations all around the globe.  HBO will be there, screening its new shows and selling them.  GAME OF THRONES will be one of the series whose rights will be on offer.  In a few more weeks we should know which countries bought the series... and which did not.  Let's hope your favorite station is one of those to pick it up.\r\n\r\n!","ditemid":146855,"eventtime":"2010-04-09 14:02:00","props":{"taglist":"hbo, game of thrones","current_moodid":43,"commentalter":1271096826,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":309,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:16,18:33,6:1,8:3,43:3,16:16,3:49,24:1,25:25,4:15,26:18,9:3,14:1,nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"verticals_list":"travel,culture","revtime":1271100277},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-04-09 20:02:08","anum":167,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html","event_timestamp":1270821720,"reply_count":51,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/98431152/7232445","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637031#t9637031","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637031#t9637031","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637031#t9637031","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"siniestrorate","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://siniestrorate.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9637031,"talkid":37644,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637031#t9637031","upictitle":"Вано - зоотехник телепузиковед: Nazi Cat","article":"=)Flying to Cannes on Sunday.<br />Will try to bring these series to Channel \"Ukraine\" in Ukraine. =) Perhaps, \"The Pacific\" as well.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"April 9 2010, 20:09:42 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://siniestrorate.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"siniestrorate","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"siniestrorate","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://siniestrorate.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"siniestrorate","ctime_ts":1270843782,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637287#t9637287","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637287#t9637287","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637287#t9637287","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637287#t9637287","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":9637287,"talkid":37645,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/146855.html?thread=9637287#t9637287","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"SVT in Sweden has been extremely good about acquiring rights to HBO original series.

With Pacific they managed to get it before most countries, so episodes are showing here just a day after they show in the USA, dubbed and all. Cuatro owners also aired The Sopranos and The Wire on a digital platform...oooh, The Wire was a mess, so badly dubbed and translated They kept calling Omar Little \"Pequeño Omar\" for three seasons because they did'nt know Little was a surname, not an adjetive.<br /><br />Dubbing and awful translations are a critical issue here. I get so pissed of at dubbings I usually download and see most TVstuff I am interested on and buy it on DVD later (because I am one of the few they put all those extras and documentaries for on the boxed sets). So probably I will see GoT pilot a day or two after it airs in the USA, then watch the dubbed version when it airs here, rant about it online like a zealot and buy the box twice, one for me and one for my mom who I got hooked on the books.
