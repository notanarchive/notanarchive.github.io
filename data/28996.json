{"itemid":113,"subject":"My Poor Jets","event":"Even when they win, they lose.\r\n\r\nYesterday Mike Nugent kicked a field goal in overtime to give the Jets a victory over the Kansas City Chefs.  Closing out the dismal season with a win.\r\n\r\nAlas, that win changed them from a 3-13 team to a 4-12 team.\r\n\r\nIf they had finished 3-13, the Jets would have had the third choice in the April's NFL draft.  At 4-12, they drop down all the way to sixth pick.  There are three other teams that finished at 4-12, and all of them get to pick before the Jets now.\r\n\r\nWhy do the other three 4-12 teams get to pick before the Jets, you ask?  The tiebreaker is \"strength of schedule.\"  The Jets played a stronger schedule than the other three 4-12 teams, so they pick last of the bunch.\r\n\r\nWhy is their strength of schedule stronger than the other three teams, you ask?  Well, for starts, the Jets had to play the Patriots twice.  That means 32-0 before you even consider the other fourteen games they played.  \r\n\r\nJust another reason to hate the Pats.\r\n\r\n(Who, by the way, will pick seventh, immediately after the Jets, thanks to their trade last season with the 49ers.  I think Pioli and Belichick must have incriminating photographs of all the other GMs and coaches in the league.  How else to explain these trades they make?  I mean, they picked up Wes Welker and Randy Moss for loose change and old jock straps, I believe.  Great work there, Miami and Oakland).","ditemid":28996,"eventtime":"2007-12-31 19:52:00","props":{"commentalter":1200580618},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2008-01-01 03:01:49","anum":68,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html","event_timestamp":1199130720,"reply_count":18,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/53383320/10642878","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?replyto=2976324","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=2976324#t2976324","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=2976324#t2976324","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=2976324#t2976324","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"theswornsword","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://theswornsword.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2976324,"talkid":11626,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=2976324#t2976324","upictitle":"Bill, the sworn sword: pic#53383320","article":"The Jets finally find a way to win when they actually need a loss.

But here I will humbly submit an alternate theory. <br /><br />Consider that the Pats defense, especially their linebackers and Rodney Harrison, are a bunch of old geezers that no longer have the stamina to play a full 60 minutes.  This was never more apparent than in last season's AFC championship, where the Colts stormed back in the 2nd half and won the game. Incidentally, that was the only game they lost in 2007.<br /><br />Ok, so they added Thomas, but essentially, the same old geezers from last year are out there this year, running the same ol' tried and true 3-4 package.  So what's the difference?  Just this: Where last year those geezers ran out of gas by the end of the third quarter, this year they don't even play hard until then.  They always play smart, of course, just not hard.  And suddenly, the 4th quarter arrives and they put the pedal to the metal.<br /><br />Guys like Joseph Addai or Willis McGahee, who were absolutely shredding the Pats in the first half are getting stuffed. Harrison is flying all over the place hitting guys and breaking up passes.  Manning and Manning have guys in their face on every play and are probably asking themselves the same question:  \"Shouldn't these guys be slowing down by now, not speeding up?\"<br /><br />Tom Brady gets a bunch more possessions near the end of the game and does what Tom Brady does best: score points in wild heart-attack drives.<br /><br />So, there's my theory.  The Patriots' change in defensive philosophy from smash-mouth crazies to cagey veterans was far more dramatic than the overhaul of their receiving corps.  And I'm still convinced it was done first and foremost to beat the Colts in the AFC championship rematch.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"January 4 2008, 15:07:23 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"My crazy theory","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://dratboy.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"dratboy","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"dratboy","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://dratboy.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"dratboy","ctime_ts":1199459243,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?replyto=3181636","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=3181636#t3181636","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=3181636#t3181636","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=3181636#t3181636","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"joyful_n_sunifl","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://joyful-n-sunifl.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":3181636,"talkid":12428,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/28996.html?thread=3181636#t3181636","upictitle":"joyful_n_sunifl: pic#70463877","article":"I live in Florida, where I must bear the pain of this awful season without any sympathizers.
