{"itemid":69,"subject":"Busy Week","event":"I've been juggling lots of balls this past week, but making good progress on a number of fronts.\r\n\r\nAll of the art is finally in for Subterranean Press's limited edition of FEVRE DREAM, and we've been going over the page proofs and placing the illustrations.   Justin Sweet has done some truly spectacular work for this one -- a great moody cover, three stunning full color plates, and a bunch of beautiful black and white interiors.  If you like illustrated books, this will be one you'll want to have, even if you've read FEVRE DREAM before.\r\n\r\nAlso been doing a lot of WILD CARDS work.  The first drafts of the stories for BUSTED FLUSH, the second of the new volumes, have been pouring in, and I've been reading them all and sending out notes to the writers for their rewrites.  With a project like WILD CARDS, the first draft is never the final one.  There's always a lot of revision required so the tales will fit together.  We're well on the way, however, and I think the book will be a strong one when it's done.  \r\n\r\nAnd I've been working on A DANCE WITH DRAGONS too.  Just finished revising the prologue a few hours ago.  As I mentioned last post, after reading it at the Indianapolis convention, there were aspects of it that I was not happy with.  The new version is a page shorter and much stronger, I think, with a better flow and crisper transitions.  I also punched up one element that somehow had gotten lost before... but it was an important element, I believe, so I'm pleased that I was able to strengthen it.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is Parris's birthday, and we're off to the Bull Ring for some of Santa Fe's best steaks.  Phipps will find a lobster too, I'm sure.  She's going to be turning 29!","ditemid":17677,"eventtime":"2007-07-17 21:16:00","props":{"commentalter":1352656413,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","hasscreened":1},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-07-18 03:27:46","anum":13,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17677.html","event_timestamp":1184706960,"reply_count":91,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/52608793/2242795","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17677.html?replyto=2120717","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17677.html?thread=2120717#t2120717","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17677.html?thread=2120717#t2120717","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17677.html?thread=2120717#t2120717","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"abbreviatedman","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://abbreviatedman.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":2120717,"talkid":8284,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/17677.html?thread=2120717#t2120717","upictitle":"abbreviatedman: pic#52608793","article":"Just wanted to say that I'm a big fan.
