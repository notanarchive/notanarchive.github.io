{"itemid":452,"subject":"Three for the Prologue","event":"A GAME OF THRONES opens in the haunted forest north of the Wall, with three brothers of the Night's Watch on a ranging.\r\n\r\nThe viewpoint character is Will, sent to the Wall for poaching.  In the pilot, he will portrayed by Bronson Webb.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00071dty/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00071dty/s320x240\" width=\"184\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00072t0c/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00072t0c\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nHe has been in projects with Tamzin Merchant, Nicholaj Coster-Waldau, and Iain Glen.  One of his first roles was \"boy on a bicycle.\" Peter Parker is Spider-Man and Bronson is a Webb, so they have spiders in common. And he has a home page, a Facebook page, and a My Space page.\r\n\r\nWill's commander on the ranging is the young knight Ser Waymar Royce, a son of Bronze Yohn Royce, new to the Wall, clad in sable cloak.  Playing Ser Waymar will be Jamie Campbell Bower.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00073ceg/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00073ceg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00074fp9/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00074fp9/s320x240\" width=\"226\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nJCB has an important role in the forthcoming HARRY POTTER movie, as a wizard from Dumbledore's past, and can also be seen the new TWILIGHT film.  And of course it is the twilight zone that lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge.  He'll also be in the PRISONER remake, but as a number, not a free man.  He was in SWEENEY TODD too, though I didn't include that in the clues.  Didn't want to make it too easy.\r\n\r\nThe grizzled veteran Gared is the third member of the prologue's intrepid trio.  His part will be played by Richard Ridings.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00075cwc/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00075cwc/s320x240\" width=\"203\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nRidings' previous credits include roles in RED DWARF, FAT FRIENDS, HIGHLANDER, and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? and turns as characters named Roach and Daddy Pig.","ditemid":115821,"eventtime":"2009-10-20 23:32:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":269,"taglist":"a game of thrones, hbo","current_moodid":109,"opt_screening":"F","commentalter":1259440633,"personifi_tags":"28:13,6:5,31:3,30:5,3:23,25:11,19:7,4:11,26:11,20:9,9:21,21:5,22:5,13:3,14:5,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-10-21 06:04:31","anum":109,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html","event_timestamp":1256081520,"reply_count":31,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?replyto=7816813","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7816813#t7816813","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7816813#t7816813","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7816813#t7816813","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"vger1970","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://vger1970.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7816813,"talkid":30534,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7816813#t7816813","upictitle":"vger1970: pic#0","article":"Wasn't he also in the movie Brothers Grimm?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"October 21 2009, 07:00:24 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Brothers Grimm","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://vger1970.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"vger1970","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"vger1970","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://vger1970.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"vger1970","ctime_ts":"1256108424","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?replyto=7818093","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818093#t7818093","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818093#t7818093","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818093#t7818093","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"rhea_kelly","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://rhea-kelly.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7818093,"talkid":30539,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818093#t7818093","upictitle":"rhea_kelly: pic#0","article":"Wow lucky Dany, Jason Momoa is hot hot hot","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"October 21 2009, 08:03:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Khal Drogo","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://rhea-kelly.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"rhea_kelly","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"rhea_kelly","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://rhea-kelly.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"rhea_kelly","ctime_ts":"1256112237","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/33414329/1942176","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?replyto=7818605","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818605#t7818605","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818605#t7818605","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818605#t7818605","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"saithkar","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://saithkar.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7818605,"talkid":30541,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/115821.html?thread=7818605#t7818605","upictitle":"Saithkar - Minister For Apocalyptic Affairs: Grim","article":"Fantastic, I can clearly see all these actors in the roles and I'm sure they will be brilliant.<br /><br />It may have been mentioned elsewhere, but I was wondering if anyone has any idea if all the cast and crew - or how many of them - have read the books and are fans of them? I know it's not required for actors to have read the original source material to put in a good performance in a film or TV adaption, and I know busy people may not have the time to read through thousands of pages, but it would be good to know.
