The Jon Snow cover (UPC Barcode: 79357348173320000) is the regular $14.95 cover.  The Ned Starks cover (UPC Barcode: 79357348173320000) is the exclusive limited edition cover.  If you ordered the exclusive cover we have made sure that the exclusive Calendar is what you are getting.\"<br /><br />So shouldn´t  these signed calendars be with limited Ned Stark cover, because these calendars are also limited to 250 pieces??? <br /><br />I thought that there was 500 pieces of limited edition covers, and 250 of them were the signed ones???<br /><br />They say this in their press release: \"500 copies  will feature an exclusive, Jon Snow cover and only 250 of them will be numbered, as well as personally signed by George R.R. Martin himself.\"<br /><br />And because there is the mix up, those should be Ned Stark covers... am I right???<br /><br />They are fooling us again!!!<br /><br />Now we are only getting standard \"cheap\" versions with your autograph, and that is really frustrating!!! :o( ","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"March 12 2009, 10:18:58 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"They sent wrong cover versions for signing!!! :o(","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://okkimoskaal.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"okkimoskaal","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"okkimoskaal","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://okkimoskaal.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"okkimoskaal","ctime_ts":1236853138,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/1184807/479470","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78766.html?replyto=5638830","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78766.html?thread=5638830#t5638830","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78766.html?thread=5638830#t5638830","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78766.html?thread=5638830#t5638830","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ferreson","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ferreson.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5638830,"talkid":22026,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/78766.html?thread=5638830#t5638830","upictitle":"Ferreson: Default","article":"Last night I was on one of my favorite sites www.deveiantart.com and I saw a thumbnail link of a picture that caught my eye. I immediately was like, <i>that's gotta be Cersei</i>. Of course this site has a vast # of artists of every kind and the picture could have been of anything, so it was really a stretch to imagine that I'd be right just from such a partial look and quick guess. But one look and you just knew it.<br /><a href=\"http://jezebel.deviantart.com/art/Cersei-Seated-101614383\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img scr=\"http://fc95.deviantart.com/fs35/f/2008/298/d/7/Cersei_Seated_by_jezebel.jpg\"></a><br /><br />I clicked the link and I was right! The artist is a young lady who goes by jezebel on the site, and I gather she's been commissioned to do some ASoIaF illustrations for the Fantasy Flight games or something.<br /><br />I just thought it was so cool how alive the character has become. So much that totally separate minds can recreate and identify her in an instant. And I thought you might appreciate the story, so I wanted to comment about it here.
