Granted, the GMs and scouts have failed the Jets organization, but when you consider that the last Pro-Bowler the Jets have drafted was Darrelle Revis, and that it was under Eric Mangini...<br /><br />I'm looking at this as objectively as I can, being a Pats fan, it is difficult.  The whole organization needs a rehaul.  Ryan is incredibly talented when it comes to defensive schemes, but the role of head coach takes away the time and attention needed to do what he does best.  <br /><br />I'm going to go into an analogy here.  Let's say in Westeros there was a highly skilled battlefield commander, a true tactician.  If you got him the men and a map of the field he could develop a battleplan to take advantage of what was a available to win.  This commander is so successful that he is raised to King's Hand, but wait, he's not supposed to be on the battlefield anymore, he has to also oversee the building of the army(scouting and drafting), political arrangements(has to deal with other franchises, trades, etc.), and the finances(contracts and the salary cap).  Ofcourse, he has people to do most of the leg work who should be more experienced in each individual field than he is, but he doesn't have enough knowledge on those fields to know if they are actually capable.  He is no longer in his element.  <br /><br />Belichick on the other hand (no pun intended), is like Tywin Lannister.  <br /><br />On the plus side, for you anyway, the Giants have won the most Superbowls in the last 10 years now... grrrrr","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"November 28 2014, 14:26:43 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Rex Ryan","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/torome86","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jimmy Potter","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2128407","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=66021282&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jimmy Potter","ctime_ts":1417184803,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19774670#t19774670","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19774670#t19774670","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19774670#t19774670","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2782718","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://plus.google.com/114719032079222348594","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19774670,"talkid":77244,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19774670#t19774670","upictitle":"Adam Shelton: pic#0","article":"As a graduate of LSU and lifelong resident of south Louisiana, I always like to see our native talent excel on a national level.

He's proven the doubters like myself wrong in the past, but time and tide wait for no one. Maybe it's simply coming to grip with the new offense. I really would like to see him play to his past high level.<br /><br />Last night the Sanchise proved that the Jets are a joke of an organization.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"November 28 2014, 22:03:40 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"nycfalcon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"nycfalcon","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://nycfalcon.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"nycfalcon","ctime_ts":1417212220,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/39846139/1216974","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19776462#t19776462","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19776462#t19776462","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19776462#t19776462","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"citabria","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://citabria.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19776462,"talkid":77251,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/392142.html?thread=19776462#t19776462","upictitle":"Citabria: C Naked sodoku","article":"You QB plea to the Jets mirrors mine to the University of Michigan (my husband's alma mater); sadly, they're not listening to either of us.

Six points in a meaningless game for the Giants. I've seen plenty of unbelievable catches in the pros and college, but for me to consider a particular catch \"great\" it needs to be important. David Tyree's catch in the Super Bowl, for example. THAT one beats Beckham's catch by a mile. I suspect, however, the young Beckham is going to make some noise in the NFL in the coming years.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"November 29 2014, 22:48:29 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://slthlvschnk.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"slthlvschnk","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"slthlvschnk","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://slthlvschnk.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"slthlvschnk","ctime_ts":1417301309,"tracked":0}]}
