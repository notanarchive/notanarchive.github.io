{"itemid":1169,"subject":"Special Edition Inside Game of Thrones","event":"Is selling on Amazon right now for $90 off the list price.  Looks like it's available at that price for about ten more hours.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Inside-HBOs-Game-Thrones-Collectors/dp/1612185738/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1352842549&sr=1-3&keywords=bryan+cogman\r\n\r\nAmazon description:  \"This spectacular collector’s edition includes a lavishly illustrated book on the making of the show, scrolled maps, plus an artist’s portfolio featuring never-before-seen storyboards, all housed in a handsome gold-stamped case.\r\n\r\nThe book reveals how the best-selling fantasy series was translated into a series that has captivated millions of viewers. It includes hundreds of unpublished set photos, production and costume designs, plus family trees, a dissection of the Dothraki language, and histories of the realms. Interviews with actors and crew members, as well as a foreword by George R.R. Martin, make this an exclusive window into the show.\r\n\r\nThe storyboards portfolio shows how comic book artist Will Simpson singlehandedly storyboarded seasons one and two and features deleted scenes and alternate scenes. Storyboards are seldom made public, so this collection is as rare as it is fascinating.\r\n\r\nCompleting the package are maps of Westeros and Esos. Fans will recognize the maps from the HBO Go bonus material for Season 2. Printed on archival, acid-free paper, and ready for framing, these maps bring the world of Game of Thrones to life.\"\r\n\r\nWe have one here at the office, and it's beautiful.  Bryan Cogman did a fabulous job putting together this insider's look at the production of the show, and the extras that come with this special edition are top notch.\r\n\r\nIf you've been coveting one of these but the price tag scared you off, then this is your chance to pick it up for less than half the sticker price.","ditemid":299412,"eventtime":"2012-11-13 14:42:00","props":{"picture_keyword":"ty","commentalter":1353538183,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","opt_lockcomments":1,"revtime":1353874310},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-11-13 21:42:19","anum":148,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299412.html","event_timestamp":1352817720,"reply_count":11,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125982087/10920433","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299412.html?thread=16844948#t16844948","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299412.html?thread=16844948#t16844948","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299412.html?thread=16844948#t16844948","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"biliki","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://biliki.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16844948,"talkid":65800,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/299412.html?thread=16844948#t16844948","upictitle":"biliki: [SH] Izzy","article":"I preordered it a few days ago, thank god I hadn't bought the simple version already.
