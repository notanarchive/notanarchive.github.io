For me \"Game Of Thrones\" is number 1 every week not just this one, hence the subjective part...I am biased in favour of the show so in my eyes IT IS the best show on television and the best one I have seen in a long, long, long time. Those who disagree, I am sure, feel quite the oppossite...<br /><br />From the prologue this show has mesmerized me, the story, the acting, the production values, the score (I was one of the doubters of Ramin Djawadi) its simply put a brilliant, fantastically put together from the casting to the costumes, the use of the CGI etc., nothing is left wanting!<br /><br />My favourite characters (mind you I love and appreciate ALL actors in all roles major and minor) remain Tyrion and Jon Snow and now adding Littlefinger. Tyrions scene in the Erye had me rolling on the floor laughing when he decided to \"confess\" his crimes!  <br /><br />I was really impressed with Emilia Clarke's work on this show, through and through, on other websites (they shall remain nameless) some critics and commentators (shall remain nameless as well) were saying at the outset that she is nothing but eyecandy...LOL...thankfully the fans knew better!   Not only has Emilia surpassed any expectations but she has been a revelation on this show, her portrayal of the changes and transformation of Daenerys is masterful and heartbreaking, and Episode 6 \"The Golden Crown\" amply showed why, that end scene...\"Fire does not kill a dragon...\" wow the look on her face is eerie and frightenning! Great job! Daeny is my mother's favourite character and I can see why...yeah my mom, the one I would least think of as a fantasy fan, basically kidnapped my TV and the show...I have to fight for space now to watch the show...LOL<br /><br />The children are awesome...Maesie Williams is the cutest thing ever, she is soo sweet and good in her role that is a joy to see her (how about a bubble head of toy of her...that would be cool!) Sophie Turner is already stunning and will break a lot of hearts when she grows up...LOL, her Sansa is played to great appeal.  Isaac is great as Bran the afflicted boy...a nod definitely has to go to Alfie Allen for his portrayal of Theon Greyjoy \"a serious boy with a serious c**k\" as Ros so deftly decribed him...Kudos and cheers to Esmee Bianco for fleshing out (no pun intended) a character, Ros, who to my understanding is not to be found in the novels.

While Sean Bean, a brilliant Ned Stark, has the fantasy and sci-fi bonafides from the LOTR trilogy or movies like \"Equilibrium\", Mark Addy really plays against character, but his portrayal of Robert Baratheon is some of the finest acting work I have had the priviledge to watch that goes both for movies and tv.  His tired, haggard and cynical demeanour is palpable.  I can see and feel how worn down, depressed and dissapointed Robert is, he really seems not to give a s*it!  <br /><br />My other praise goes to Lena Headey who has done a spectacular job through a very understated and low key performance.  I personally feel she is sometimes unfairly overlooked.  When she was initially cast people were dissapointed because she was \"not pretty enough\"!!!  I have both volumes with the art of \"A Song Of Ice And Fire\" which is great all-around, and yes I have seen the illustrations of Cersei, but I for one am glad the way the show was cast and not only her role.  Geesh, the last thing I want to see is some preening tween models strutting on the screen trying to convey emotions via wooden acting and none-existent personalities...for that we have \"The Twilight Saga\"... :-P<br /><br />Ms. Headey is beautiful in my eyes, but I love how through her acting, costume, make-up etc., she so effectively portrays Cersei. One can assume that in her younger days Cersei was a great beauty, but life has worn her down.  She is rough around the edges and really beaten (no pun intended) by the storms she has had to endure being married for 17 years to a man that has no feelings for her, other than disgust, hatred and resentment...and worse of all, a man who reserves all his love for Leona Stark...Robert loves a memory more than he loves his flesh-and-blood wife!  I think that seeing the passion and genuine emotions Robert has virtually for a ghost, cuts her deeper than anything else he has done to her, including slapping her, opennly cheating and humiliating her...I really don't blame her for the way she has turned out...she is not innocent, but one can at least understand where she comes from...unfortunatelly her situation mirrors a lot of real life situations women find themselves in, many of whom I know personally...so huzaahhhh to Lena!<br /><br />I guess this whole rambling mess of a comment was to say that regardless of critics, top ten lists etc., \"Game Of Thrones\" is always number 1 with me.  When 10 years ago I was lucky enough to watch the first installment of the LOTR trilogy, \"The Fellowship Of The Ring\", I knew within the first few minutes that I would never look at movies the same way as before.  I get the exact same feeling with \"Game Of Thrones\", the advantage in this case is that I have a longer (5-7 seasons hopefully) period of time to savour my arrival to that understanding!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 27 2011, 20:23:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Always Number 1 Part Deux","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://loco73.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"loco73","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"loco73","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://loco73.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"loco73","ctime_ts":1306527818,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218186.html?thread=13707338#t13707338","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218186.html?thread=13707338#t13707338","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218186.html?thread=13707338#t13707338","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trutwijd","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trutwijd.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":13707338,"talkid":53544,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/218186.html?thread=13707338#t13707338","above":13706570,"upictitle":"trutwijd: pic#51726066","article":"Not much to add, this was a great review.

<br /><br />I missed you out once in Spain :( snif snif, but it would be a refreshing experience (both for you and for me) if you could oh-so-please consider the UAE as one of your future destinations... :D<br /><br />An-ever-ASOIF-fan...","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 29 2011, 05:56:06

Ravenpuff bi-color","article":"I'm quite deliciously hooked on this series.  And a few years back someone pointed out that if I love the Harry Potter series, I should certainly read this series.  Well, I bought the first two or three books, but haven't gotten around to reading them yet.  I will have to read them now for sure and see at least if the amount of lasciviousness in the book is equal to that portrayed on screen.  I don't mind sex in a series/book, and the TV version seems to show it as part of the story, not to drive the story.  That's a fine line and if the TV series is true to the books in that sense, then kudos to you Mr. Martin for succeeding where a lot of prose turns a rather lurid color of purple in many other books and TV series.  And thanks for not making the sex too sentimental either.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"May 29 2011, 06:32:54 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bonsaibetz.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bonsaibetz","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bonsaibetz","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bonsaibetz.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"May 29 2011, 06:33:50 UTC","dname":"bonsaibetz","ctime_ts":1306650774,"tracked":0}]}
