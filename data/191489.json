{"itemid":748,"subject":"Home Again","event":"I'm back at home in Santa Fe, after five days in LA for the TCA and Vroman's signing.\r\n\r\nThe LA trip was great for me.  Yes, it was tiring, and I faded a lot faster than before my hospital stay... but it gave my spirits a huge boost to become George the Writer once again, after the dehumanizing experience of being George the Patient.  The TCA was an amazing experience... seeing the new trailer, doing all the interviews (many on video, clips from which you'll doing be seeing in the future of CNN, E, Sky, and all the other channels that sat me down for questioning), and of course the big panel.  That last one I did with David and Dan, Sean Bean, Emilia Clarke, and Peter Dinklage.  What a rush.\r\n\r\nThe Vroman's signing was also amazing.  I've heard various estimates of turnout... but considering that it was sort of a last-minute thing, the number of readers who showed up was staggering.  I'm sorry we had to cut off inscriptions halfway through the queue, but it was the only was to make certain everyone got at least one book signed.  \r\n\r\nAnd all the readers were so kind.  I have the best fans in the world.  I appreciate all of your good wishes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm much stronger now than when I left, and getting better every day... but the work has piled up as well, so tomorrow my nose goes back on the grindstone.  For a few hours, anyway.  Parris and my docs agree, no more twelve-hour days for a while.  So posts here may be less frequent than before.  Kong comes first.","ditemid":191489,"eventtime":"2011-01-11 21:30:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"everyday life, signings, hbo","current_moodid":125,"commentalter":1295546705,"opt_lockcomments":1,"personifi_word_count":281,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"17:5,6:10,8:10,10:5,38:5,23:10,36:5,32:5,1:10,3:15,24:10,25:20,4:10,26:10,20:5,9:10,21:5,14:10,nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1296155174},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-01-12 04:30:30","anum":1,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/191489.html","event_timestamp":1294781400,"reply_count":50,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97542034/7302185","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/191489.html?thread=11762177#t11762177","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/191489.html?thread=11762177#t11762177","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/191489.html?thread=11762177#t11762177","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"twistedsheets10","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twistedsheets10.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11762177,"talkid":45946,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/191489.html?thread=11762177#t11762177","upictitle":"twistedsheets10: jon snow kicks everyone&#39;s ass","article":"Happy you're feeling better!

I will follow with interest any news that are bound to trickle once the interviews start appearing on mainstream television shows. Over at Winter-Is-Coming.net, the coverage ot the TCA as well as the book signing has been reported in great detail and with a lot of humour and originality, they are doing a great job supporting you sir and the series-to-be.<br /><br />Once again I wish you all the best, a speedy recovery, be well always and take care!  A belated Happy New Year 2011 for you, your wife and the rest of your family and friends!<br /><br />PS  Today I am a very happy nerd, I just got my HBO-Game Of Thrones t-shirt (the one with the raven and \"Winter-Is-Coming\" incription), plus I am stoked with the \"Ice And Fire\" calendar...I can barely control myself from jumping ahead and seeing all the art work, but...it would feel like cheating...LOL, still, I can see the little preview drawing for February in the lower right hand corner, and it is Storm's End, and it looks magnificent, just as Winterfell looks now in January.
