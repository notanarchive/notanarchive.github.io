{"itemid":1947,"subject":"A Salute to Immigrants","event":"The United States is a nation of immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of you reading this are descended from immigrants (aside from those few who are Native American).   I know I am.  My paternal grandfather came over from Italy as a child.  My maternal grandfather was Irish-American, a Brady whose own ancestors hailed from Oldcastle in County Meath.  My paternal grandmother was half German and half Welsh.  My maternal grandmother had French and English ancestry.  I am a mongrel to the bone.  In short, American.\r\n\r\nWherever they came from, and whenever they made the crossing, all of my immigrant ancestors faced hardships, poverty, and discrimination when they came here.  They came looking for freedom, they came looking for a better life.  And they found it, or made it... and in the process they stopped being Irish or Italian or German and became Americans.\r\n\r\nThe process is still going on today.  Men and women dreaming of a better life still look to America, and cross oceans and deserts by whatever means they can to find that better life.   They face hardships and discrimination as well.  Not everyone welcomes them.  Some talk of walls, of keeping people out, of sending them back.  My ancestors faced the same sort of talk.  So did yours.  It's an old old story, as old as our republic.  Millard Fillmore is dead and forgotten, but the Know Nothing Party is alive and well today, under other names.  They still know nothing.\r\n\r\nBut some of us remember where we came from.  Some of us remember that it was the immigrants, those tired poor huddled masses, who made America great to begin with.<b></b> \r\n\r\nFrom September 23 to September 30, the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe will proudly be screening five great films about immigration and the immigrant experience.  A mix of old films and new films, featuring a wide range of actors of all races, colors, and ethnicities, by some of cinema's finest writers and directors.  Comedy, drama, terror; immigrants have known it all, and these movies will reflect that.  Some are among my own favorite movies.  Others I have yet to see.\r\n\r\nHere are the trailers for the films we'll be screening:\r\n\r\nMOSCOW ON THE HUDSON\r\n<lj-embed id=\"825\"/>\r\n\r\nTHE LOST CITY\r\n<lj-embed id=\"826\"/>\r\n\r\nAVALON\r\n<lj-embed id=\"827\"/>\r\n\r\nDESIERTO\r\n<lj-embed id=\"828\"/>\r\n\r\nSIN NOMBRE\r\n<lj-embed id=\"829\"/>\r\n\r\nCheck the Jean Cocteau website for dates and showtimes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the films themselves, we plan to feature some appearances by the actors, directors, and some of our local political figures, talking about the movies, their own families, the issues surrounding immigration, and the like.   We'll have more details on that as the dates firm up.  But I know I will be kicking things off myself on Friday, September 23.\r\n\r\n<b><i>And as a way of welcoming our newest Americans, during the entire week, admission to all shows will be FREE for anyone who can show us a green card.</i></b>  \r\n\r\n(And while I cannot promise a taco truck on every corner, we do hope to have a wide variety of food trucks turning up in front of the JCC at peak times, offering all sorts of tasty treats).","ditemid":498526,"eventtime":"2016-09-10 18:09:00","props":{"current_mood":"contemplative","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"jean cocteau cinema, films, politics","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sun Sep 11 00:08:55 2016]R [Sun Sep 11 00:08:56 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/774761609633804288 ","current_moodid":101,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1474686983,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/774761609633804288","ratingbot_comment":"[cyr:-|ua:-|noncyr:21|by:-|ru:-|rureg:-]","picture_keyword":"cocteau","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":3,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.64644951564161]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1473552554}","revtime":1474847776},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-09-11 00:08:54","anum":94,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498526.html","event_timestamp":1473530940,"reply_count":76,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/121411156/65344279","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498526.html?thread=24958046#t24958046","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498526.html?thread=24958046#t24958046","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498526.html?thread=24958046#t24958046","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2058420","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/GeekFurious","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24958046,"talkid":97492,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/498526.html?thread=24958046#t24958046","upictitle":"GeekFurious: pic#121411156","article":"I became a US citizen on 15 June, 2016.

Even Trump goes on a big spiel about how his wall will have a big fat door in which people will be welcomed into the country, but they have to come legally. <br /><br />Likewise, in Europe, the big fear is that migrants from the Middle East aren't coming to Germany or Sweden to accept German values or Swedish values, but rather will move to Germany and Sweden and keep to their old ways, which are often sharply at odds with modern liberal secular values. Do you consider it no problem at all if a large group of immigrants moves into a country that values free speech while holding to the idea that people who draw pictures of the Prophet Mohammed deserve to be jailed or even killed? How can there be compromise in such a situation? One must win and the other must lose. <br /><br />And, of course, there's an ugly underbelly to the stirring portrait of American immigration as a force for good: when our ancestors came here, there were already people here. We either killed them, caused them to die through disease or dispossessed them and took what we liked through force, leaving their ancestors to mostly irrelevance in modern society. I'm pretty sure if a native american were asked if immigration is always for the best of the people already living there, they might have a bit more nuanced conception of that idea.

Many people blame the inescapable demagogue we see on TV and the internet every day for the rise in bigotry. Yet, his supporters are the ones that truly lack clarity and blame scapegoats for unrelated problems. These are the type of people I dealt with for years. People who characterize and treat others as lazy, worthless, uneducated, etc. even though these same people are completely unwilling to accept or even learn about people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. <br /><br />Mr. Martin, in 2013 I moved to Washington, D.C. to work for a Republican Senator (primarily handling constituent services, nothing too important). I once gave a tour of the U.S. Capitol to a constituent who told me Rosa Parks' bust didn't deserve to be placed in the rotunda (or anywhere in the Capitol for that matter). Another time I gave a tour to a man I would describe as a religious fanatic who watched too many documentaries on the History Channel. He claimed the U.S. government has been covering up the fact that the world is just 6000 years old by editing all textbooks and magazines circulated around the country. <br /><br />Anyways, I gave up working for the GOP in 2015 after spending a deal of time working at a local Republican office in Cincinnati, Ohio. I cannot tell you, as a Conservative, how disappointed I am the party I worked my tail off for. I couldn't be more supportive of low taxes, less government programs (mainly social security) government intervention in the private sector and health care, etc. But the GOP doesn't seem to care about any of those issues this year. I guess they require too much brainpower to discuss. Anyways, I moved out of the U.S. and am now becoming fluent in Chinese 你可能不相信我哈哈, 但你是我最喜欢的作者。I only hope political realignment happens soon because it's time for a new political party.
