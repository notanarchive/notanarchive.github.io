How he could destroy the Giants defense in a single year, when he had all the players Steve Spagnuolo had and then some, is a mystery for the ages.\r\n\r\nAnd the Jets... well, yeah, I'm glad they got the W, but really... call me old school, but I believe a team should play hard every week, no matter what.  What Caldwell did was a disgrace.  A nice late Xmas present for Gang Green, sure, but all the other teams contending for the AFC wild card must be steaming, and Peyton and the other Colts first-stringers looked none too happy on the sidelines either.  I would not be the least surprised if the Happy Horseshoes make an early exit from the playoffs after this.

Their was no lane discipline. The LB corp are weak. The DBs are second and third stringers. <br /><br />The Panthers are a decent team. They are well coached and better coordinated. The Giants coaching staff has, even since the days of Fassel, shown an inability to have a plan B.<br /><br />This Giants team needs some serious reconstruction.

Delhomme had the worst (and likely last) season of his career, and they had some injuries. Early in the year, Steve Smith wasn't getting the ball. The Defense was on the field too much, and even good defenses break down (see Pittsburgh). Also, I think the injury to DeAngelo Williams was a good thing, because it's finally forced Carolina to go with Stewart, who is like another Michael Turner. Williams is quick and can break off long runs, but Stewart has good speed and is like trying to tackle a wrecking ball. Finally, Matt Moore is the real deal at QB. With good balance on offense, the defense has the legs to maintain their pass rush and stop the run consistently. The Giants just got manhandled by a team looking for respect after a horrible start.  I wish the Seahawks could have pulled it together as well as the Panthers.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","below":8197690,"ctime":"December 28 2009,

It'll serve us right to get knocked out in the first round.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 28 2009, 19:10:39 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Disgraced Colts fan","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://lyonel-bara-ls.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"lyonel_bara_ls","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"lyonel_bara_ls","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://lyonel-bara-ls.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"lyonel_bara_ls","ctime_ts":1262027439,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/54423966/10940478","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?replyto=8194362","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8194362#t8194362","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8194362#t8194362","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8194362#t8194362","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8194362#t8194362","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bonzoid","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bonzoid.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8194362,"talkid":32009,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8194362#t8194362","upictitle":"bonzoid: pic#54423966","article":"If the starters played and a key player was lost to injury everyone would be howling for Caldwell's head.

Can the Jets advance in the playoffs?  Not likely at all.  Really, it's kind of cruel to the Jets who are most likely going to lose their first playoff game.  The Colts earned the right to coast by going 14 and 0 in the first place.  That's a pretty nice perk.<br /><br />I'd make the same call Caldwell did, play your starters for the first half, let them get their reps in, find their rhythm and then protect them. 16 and 0 is meaningless to the Colts.

If the Broncos can't win a home game against the Raiders and JaMarcus friggin Russell, they don't belong in the playoffs anyway.<br /><br />I am disappointed with Caldwell's decision, but that's more because I feel like he passed on a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Winning a Super Bowl is a great achievement, but running the table would have cemented the 2009 Colts as an all-time great team.  If Peyton were hurt or getting banged up or something, I'd understand, but pulling a perfectly healthy Peyton in a 5-point game isn't cool.  And the fans in Indy were not happy with the decision either--you know, the fans who payed full-price for those tickets?  Something tells me they aren't going to get a refund, even if the game evidently meant nothing to their team's head coach.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 28 2009, 19:37:33 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://essasault.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"essasault","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"essasault","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://essasault.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"essasault","ctime_ts":1262029053,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/66437100/3109074","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?replyto=8195386","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195386#t8195386","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195386#t8195386","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195386#t8195386","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jimbow8","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jimbow8.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8195386,"talkid":32013,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195386#t8195386","upictitle":"jimbow8: Cowboys","article":"Manning said all the right things in backing his coaches decision, but you could tell by the look on his face on the sidelines that he was pretty upset.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 28 2009, 20:19:04 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jimbow8.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jimbow8","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jimbow8","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jimbow8.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jimbow8","ctime_ts":1262031544,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/63783416/12568334","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?replyto=8195642","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195642#t8195642","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195642#t8195642","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195642#t8195642","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mikey77711","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mikey77711.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8195642,"talkid":32014,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8195642#t8195642","upictitle":"mikey77711: pic#63783416","article":"As a jets fan I am not apologizing to anyone for our victory yesterday.

You are ignoring the fact that the Giants who won the super-bowl that year had no bye-week in the playoffs that year and played hard from game 1 through 19. They could have taken game 16 off during the regular season to rest up for the play offs, but they didn't. They instead played and lost in an Epic game that gave New England it's perfect regular season.<br /><br />Allow me to quote Teddy Bruschi, a member of the NE 2007 team and now ESPN analyst. He has been an integral part of 4 superbowl teams. This was his response to the Colt's decision and he is 100% correct.<br /><br />  \"My question is: Rest for what? The playoffs?<br /><br />The Colts already have a first-round bye. That is the time to rest.<br /><br />There aren't many times in your life when you have a chance to do something that has never been done before. When you are faced with a challenge like that, my feeling is that you embrace it and see if you've got what it takes to conquer it.<br /><br />That's the way we felt in New England. And yes, we lost the Super Bowl, but let me be clear: We lost the Super Bowl because the New York Giants played better than we did that day. It was not because we were tired and needed more rest.\"<br /><br />In the NFL, winning teams play hard 100% of the time, they play to win and they do not take a break on the field. NFL teams are actually very close to each other in terms of talent. What separates winning teams and losing teams and what makes championship teams is the mental state of the team. Teams that let up or take games off are not winning teams.<br /><br />And as an aside, there is no running up the score in the NFL. You do everything you can to secure the win. Were the Colts running up the score in 2004 when Peyton set the touchdown record?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 29 2009, 16:27:38 UTC","parent":8196410,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Unpopular but smart","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cauldwell.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cauldwell","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cauldwell","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cauldwell.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cauldwell","ctime_ts":1262104058,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8202810#t8202810","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8202810#t8202810","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8202810#t8202810","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"chocotaco33","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://chocotaco33.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8202810,"talkid":32042,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8202810#t8202810","above":8201786,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","parent":8201786,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Unpopular but smart","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://chocotaco33.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"chocotaco33","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"chocotaco33","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://chocotaco33.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"chocotaco33","ctime_ts":1262128037,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8205370#t8205370","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8205370#t8205370","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8205370#t8205370","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cauldwell","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cauldwell.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8205370,"talkid":32052,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8205370#t8205370","above":8202810,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","parent":8202810,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Unpopular but smart","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cauldwell.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cauldwell","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cauldwell","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cauldwell.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cauldwell","ctime_ts":1262196627,"leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?replyto=8197434","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8197434#t8197434","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8197434#t8197434","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8197434#t8197434","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"floodone","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://floodone.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8197434,"talkid":32021,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/124218.html?thread=8197434#t8197434","upictitle":"floodone: pic#104257887","article":"As a long time Colts fan, I have never been more disgusted by my teams management than I am right now.
