{"itemid":1970,"subject":"Cubs Win","event":"The Cubs have won the World Series.  \r\n\r\nYes, you read that right.   The Cubs have won the World Series, for the first time in one hundred and eight years.   They are weeping in Cleveland and dancing in the streets of Chicago.\r\n\r\nSurely the end of days is at hand.   The seventh seal has broken, some rough beast is slouching toward Bethlehem (or Washington, D.C.), pigs are flying.   The Cubs have come back from being down three games to one, and that bleating you hear is the billy goat that cursed them so long ago.  \r\n\r\nSomewhere Harry Carey is saying \"Holy Cow,\" and Steve Goodman is singing.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"849\"/>\r\n\r\nTruth be told, I'm a Mets fan.   We have our own agonies, sharing a city with the Yankees.  But it's nothing like the pain Cubs fans have known.  We will always have 1969.  A painful memory for Cubs fans, and golden one for Mets fans.  And we will always have 1986.  Agony for Red Sox fans, magic for Mets fans... and especially for Parris and me, who were actually there for game six, in great seats four rows up on the first base side, so close to the field that we could see the stitches on the ball as it rolled between Bill Buckner's legs.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  As I saying, I'm a Mets fan... but I did go to college at Northwestern (1966-1971), and did my VISTA service in Chicago (1971-1973), and lived there in Uptown afterwards (1973-1976), so I have a certain affection for the Cubbies too.   I certainly enjoyed many a lazy spring and fall afternoon sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley, both in college and after.   (Okay, okay, living in Chicago and being surrounded by Cubs fans as I was, I took a certain cruel pleasure from the Mets classic run in 1969, mea culpa).   I'd still prefer the Mets to win it all... but if it can't be them, I'm glad it was the Cubs.   Chicago is a great city, Wrigley is a great field, and Steve Goodman was a great songwriter.\r\n\r\nSo congratulations to all my friends in the Second City.  Enjoy the moment.   Let's hope it isn't another hundred and eight years before it comes again.\r\n\r\nThere is one fly in the ointment, though.  Last week, when the Cubs were down 3 games to 1, Nate Silver wrote that Trump had as much chance of winning the election as the Cubs did of winning the series.   \r\n\r\nBe afraid.  Be very afraid.\r\n\r\nThe Cubs have won the World Series.   The end is nigh.","ditemid":504430,"eventtime":"2016-11-03 12:48:00","props":{"current_mood":"mischievous","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"baseball, humor","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Nov  3 18:47:45 2016]R [Thu Nov  3 18:47:46 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/794249728711983104 ","current_moodid":36,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1478280757,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/794249728711983104","picture_keyword":"happy blue","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":1,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.70390479475708]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1478198866}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/1970","revtime":1478280827},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-11-03 18:47:45","anum":110,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504430.html","event_timestamp":1478177280,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126820196/79137571","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504430.html?thread=25158510#t25158510","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504430.html?thread=25158510#t25158510","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504430.html?thread=25158510#t25158510","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3879046","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Wolvie58","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25158510,"talkid":98275,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/504430.html?thread=25158510#t25158510","upictitle":"Sue Duff: pic#126820196","article":"have faith George- it will be HRC.

But it can be hard pulling for a team that's only ever delivered heartbreak. Even so, I could never have switched loyalties even if I'd wanted to (and times were I thought about it). I love that you shared Steve Goodman's great \"A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request,\" which really captures that angst. It's a better song than \"Go Cubs, Go,\" but doesn't really work as something for the crowd to sing along with after a win, of course. I'm glad Cub fans can finally bury the curse. It's a beautiful day for a funeral.<br /><br />Also, it's amazing how winning the World Series can soften the bitterness you feel toward the teams that tormented you for decades. They were only doing their jobs, after all.
