{"itemid":600,"subject":"No Place Like Home","event":"We got back home last night, after a pleasant weekend at LepreCon.  The convention was very small, only half the size of Bubonicon, but the Phoenix fen were a friendly bunch and we had a great time.\r\n\r\nI should never go away, though.  The amount of stuff that builds up when I leave, even for a short trip like this one, is truly daunting.  Hundreds of emails, huge stacks of snail mail (bills, contracts, junk, with a few real letters salted in)... and, for this trip at least, must be a hundred or more new audition tapes for parts both small (Rast, Mord, Jhogo) and large (Lord Tywin, Ser Barristan, Lysa Arryn) in the HBO series.  I was keeping up with the auditions pretty well.  Now I'm way, way behind...\r\n\r\nWell, nothing to do but get into it.  I have another convention trip coming up soon, and lots to do before we go.","ditemid":153810,"eventtime":"2010-05-19 15:15:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":154,"opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":28,"commentalter":1274662440,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"18:50,42:16,3:66,25:16,26:16,20:16,22:16,nterms:yes","verticals_list":"travel"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-05-19 21:15:43","anum":210,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153810.html","event_timestamp":1274282100,"reply_count":59,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/100062162/15658296","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153810.html?replyto=10096338","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153810.html?thread=10096338#t10096338","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153810.html?thread=10096338#t10096338","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153810.html?thread=10096338#t10096338","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"odeocowboys","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://odeocowboys.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10096338,"talkid":39438,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/153810.html?thread=10096338#t10096338","upictitle":"odeocowboys: xlormp","article":"I'm sorry you have so much to do!

Do you guys play some sort of license plate game where you make up new Wild Cards characters? :)<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the con and can relax a bit, Mr. Martin.  How do you feel about KC BBQ?  Hopefully you'll be able to squeeze in a few BBQ platters while you're out there.
