{"itemid":1102,"subject":"Stealing Jake","event":"Giants tight end Jake Ballard played well all season, until he tore his ACL in the Super Bowl.  It was a serious injury, requiring surgery.  Recovery is lengthy, and Ballard will not be able to play at all in 2012.  He is going to miss the entire season.  So the Giants put him on waivers.  I mean, who is going to claim a player who can't play?  Once he cleared waivers, Jake could be put on the Reserved/ PUP list (Physically Unable to Perform).  He'd still be Giant, and come 2013, presumably he would be healthy again and able to return to the team.\r\n\r\nThat's what the Giants wanted.  That's what Jake wanted.\r\n\r\nBut he didn't clear waivers.  He was claimed by another team.  To the astonishment of all.\r\n\r\nWho would do such a thing, you ask?  \r\n\r\nWho else?  The New England Patriots.\r\n\r\nStuff like this is why we call him Evil Little Bill.\r\n\r\nThe Giants are pissed.  Ballard is reportedly pretty unhappy as well.  Evil Little Bill says what he did was legal (it was, completely), that there are no \"unwritten rules\" (there are, that's wrong, but hell, Bill breaks WRITTEN rules, as in Spygate, so of course he doesn't believe in unwritten ones, or things like, oh, sportsmanship).\r\n\r\nThe Patriots don't even need a tight end.  They already have the best tight end tandem in the NFL in Gronkowski and Hernandez, both of whom are actually better than Jake Ballard.  This move screws the Giants, but it also screws Ballard, who would have been a starter on the Giants when he came back in 2013.  On the Pats, he'll warm the bench and play in some three tight end sets.\r\n\r\nHave you no shame, Evil Little Bill?\r\n\r\nBoo.  Hiss.  Boo.","ditemid":282153,"eventtime":"2012-06-14 19:20:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":1,"commentalter":1340647650,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":4,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1341086605},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-06-15 01:20:40","anum":41,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html","event_timestamp":1339701600,"reply_count":66,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117716828/50482823","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16100137#t16100137","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16100137#t16100137","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16100137#t16100137","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1258979","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/112163442288863061009","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16100137,"talkid":62891,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16100137#t16100137","upictitle":"Michael Cicconi: pic#117716828","article":"I don't think this is an \"evil\" decision necessarily.

Now if only I could get my brother, a big fan of the Giants, to shut up about it.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"June 15 2012, 07:14:57 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"I feel your pain","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://www.facebook.com/amenra.lumumba","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Amen-Ra Lumumba","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1259260","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=50487503&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Amen-Ra Lumumba","ctime_ts":1339744497,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16105513#t16105513","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16105513#t16105513","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16105513#t16105513","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"aliassc","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://aliassc.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16105513,"talkid":62912,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16105513#t16105513","upictitle":"aliassc: pic#0","article":"..you win or you die.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"June 15 2012, 07:52:38 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"In the game of NFL..","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://aliassc.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"aliassc","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"aliassc","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://aliassc.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"aliassc","ctime_ts":1339746758,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117719831/50488619","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106025#t16106025","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106025#t16106025","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106025#t16106025","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1259368","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/106316207774545414208","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16106025,"talkid":62914,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106025#t16106025","upictitle":"Discsid: pic#117719831","article":"Happens to everybody.

I have to say thought that Jerry Resse and the Giants were trying to save a few bucks and got burnt. If they coveted him so much they could have protected his rights by moving him from the 90 man training camp roster right to the PUP. But then his full salary would have been owed. So Reese once again cheaped out and this time had to pay the price.<br /><br />Reese has made a habit of this, most recently nickle and diming Osi for the last couple years. It was getting so bad even the other players had to say something. Not saying Osi handled himself in the best way during it but just stating the precedent. <br /><br />It was a douche move but hey this is Evil Little Bill we are talking about, this or anything else should have been expected when you leave a player totally unprotected like the Giants did. <br /><br />I feel bad for Tom Coughlin in this because by the terse interview he gave you could almost see that he brought up the possibility of this happening and got a \"Tom don't worry, no one will pick up an injured player\" response from someone higher up.<br /><br />You just came off a SB, take care of your guys and stop penny pinching so much or don't be shocked when stuff like this happens.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"June 15 2012, 08:47:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bigdaddysfe.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bigdaddysfe","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bigdaddysfe","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bigdaddysfe.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bigdaddysfe","ctime_ts":1339750073,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106537#t16106537","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106537#t16106537","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106537#t16106537","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106537#t16106537","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1223951","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://profiles.google.com/117153829817189964269","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":16106537,"talkid":62916,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/282153.html?thread=16106537#t16106537","upictitle":"Simon Schmid: pic#0","article":"Oh, this is about this strange sports where people run around trying to hug the one who carries a misformed ball, right?<br />I think hardly anyone outside of the US gets what this game is about or even  follows it.
