{"itemid":1240,"subject":"Free Agency Follies","event":"Free agency has opened in the NFL, but someone forgot to tell my New York teams.\r\n\r\nThe Giants have resigned Aaron Ross, a cornerback they drafted a few years back, then lost in last year's free agency.  Otherwise they seem to be asleep.  They just lost Kenny Phillips, their starting safety.  Phillips has been hurt a lot, and last year his replacement Stevie Brown outplayed him, but when he was healthy he was staunch against the run.  The G-Men have also have Osi on the free agent market, though so far no one has signed him, so maybe he will be back.\r\n\r\nThe Jets... don't get me started about the Jets.  So far they have lost their starting RB, their best TE, a solid part of the defensive line rotation, both starting safeties.  And rumors persist that they are about to trade Darrelle Revis, their best player.  The Jets finished 6-10 last year, fired their GM, and brought in a new one.  They kept Rex Ryan, which I think was good... Rex has only had one bad season in his four with Gang Green, and has proved himself to be a good coach... but this new GM seems to be setting him up to fail.  The Jets were 6-10 last year, but instead of improving, it appears they are aiming for the number one overall draft choice in 2014.  You can't win games without players.  If the Jets crash and burn next year, Rex will get the blame, but Vince Lombardi could return from the dead and he still wouldn't win a game with the roster the new management is handing Ryan.\r\n\r\nPfui, I say.\r\n\r\nOh, and the Patriots... what a vile thing is Evil Little Bill.  The way he treated Wes Welker is disgraceful.  Man has absolutely no loyalty to anyone.  Watch and see, when Tom Brady's talents start to fade -- and they will, it happens to all of them -- Evil Little Bill will ship him out as well.","ditemid":317581,"eventtime":"2013-03-15 15:38:00","props":{"current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":95,"commentalter":1364275667,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":3,"revtime":1365189770},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2013-03-15 21:38:40","anum":141,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html","event_timestamp":1363361880,"reply_count":38,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120369225/61735000","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17413773#t17413773","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17413773#t17413773","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17413773#t17413773","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1701536","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/michael.mischnick","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17413773,"talkid":68022,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17413773#t17413773","upictitle":"Michael Mischnick: pic#120369225","article":"I hate Belecheck and the Patriots as much as you (well, probably nowhere near as much as you since I am a Vikings fan, and you are a Giants/Jets fan, so you have two reasons to hate them), but I don't think they really treated Welker that badly.

This year, they've snagged a few free agents and kept a few from leaving. Spring is the best time of the year to be a Lions fan. The draft is our superbowl.<br /><br />Unrelated: I'm reading Storm of Swords, and timing it perfect to finish on March 31st, around 9 or 10 pm.

The Jets especially need some of that.  Giants always draft well too, and should just focus on having a great O with a handful of pass rushers who can make a difference late in games, kinda like how the colts used to be.

I have a feeling that Belichick and Tywin would be able to relate to each other fairly well.  I think it comes down to the fact that the Patriots' mantra is \"Team first\" and if they give in to one player, even a star like Welker, then everyone else will try to get a bigger contract and then the whole organization falls apart; which is why the Pats have remained dominant for the last 12 years and most other franchises have been so up and down.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 years ago","ctime":"March 18 2013, 17:28:53 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://torome86.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"torome86","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"torome86","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://torome86.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"torome86","ctime_ts":1363627733,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/120390054/61841300","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17432717#t17432717","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17432717#t17432717","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17432717#t17432717","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1706565","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/eriknorth","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":17432717,"talkid":68096,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/317581.html?thread=17432717#t17432717","upictitle":"Erik North: pic#120390054","article":"Pats fan are livid about how they treated Welker.

They had three spectacular between the numbers talents in Welker and Aarob Gronknandez.
