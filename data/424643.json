{"itemid":1658,"subject":"Sasquan Opens Hugo Voting","event":"For those who are already members of worldcon, Sasquan has opened Hugo voting.  With the electronic ballot, you can go and post some preferences and votes now, then return a day later, or a week later, or a month later, and change them, or add some more rankings.  Your vote does not get counted until balloting closes.  \r\n\r\nThe ballot is here: http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/voting/\r\n\r\nIf you have not voted the Hugo Awards before, please note that it is an \"Australian ballot,\" a preferential system whereby one ranks the nominees.  You don't just vote for one.  You can rank NO AWARD as if it were any other finalist; ahead of some nominees, behind others.\r\n\r\n(Which is the way I believe one should use NO AWARD.  As I have stated previously, I am opposed to the nuclear option of just blindly voting NO AWARD in every category).\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to member to vote.  Supporting Memberships will cost you $40.  You can sign up to buy one at https://sasquan.swoc.us/sasquan/reg.php\r\n\r\nIn addition to voting privileges, a Supporting Membership will get you the convention's program book (usually a handsome item, though it varies from year to year) and other publications.","ditemid":424643,"eventtime":"2015-05-04 22:28:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1431989784,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":" Sasquan Opens Hugo Voting http://goo.gl/ElytYO","picture_keyword":"hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":4,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.626311231370717]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1430281740}","revtime":1433456008},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-04-29 04:28:36","anum":195,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html","event_timestamp":1430778480,"reply_count":13,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119956036/1407919","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21531331#t21531331","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21531331#t21531331","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21531331#t21531331","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ffutures","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ffutures.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21531331,"talkid":84106,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21531331#t21531331","upictitle":"Marcus L.

I think this is worth considering irrespective of the puppy issue.<br /><br />Today most of the categories are for short form works. Back in the days when Azimov started, short stories were the principal medium for SF. Today the market for paid short stories is practically non existent. The market is looking for big novels and preferably series like ASOIAF. But there is only one award for novels and series only get recognition on the basis of individual books.<br /><br />So some reorg of the categories to give more recognition for the longer works seems necessary.<br /><br />There is also the question of recognition of video games as an emerging medium. Its almost 30 years since I wrote video games. In the 8 bit era there was no scope for anything like a plot. But virtual worlds like Skyrim and MineCraft have changed that entirely.<br /><br />Building an immersive environment like Skyrim is an enterprise as complex and high risk as an action movie. The budget for Skyrim was $80 million, about the same as a season of GoT or an upper midrange feature movie. Since the return was over a billion it is most likely that the next installment of the Elder Scrolls will cost more to make than the next Bond movie.<br /><br />This is a serious medium that offers different opportunities and constraints to traditional forms. We already have Westeros in Minecraft, Skyrim is clearly building on and extending the fantasy form. It isn't exactly Westeros but it would be fairly easy to build Westeros using the Skyrim game engine: Just take out the use of magic for combat, add white walkers and import the geography from the HBO opening credits and it is 50% there.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"2 years ago","ctime":"May 14 2015, 15:32:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Thinking laterally","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/+hallambaker","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Phillip Hallam-Baker","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3120056","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=75362488&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Phillip Hallam-Baker","ctime_ts":1431617556,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21642179#t21642179","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21642179#t21642179","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21642179#t21642179","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21642179,"talkid":84539,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21642179#t21642179","above":21641411,"upictitle":"George R.R.

But I think worth bearing in mind if we work out how to defeat the puppy types, its the gamergate poison that has given them the boost this year. I have no sympathy for the gamergate misogyny, but they are actually right about game reviews in magazines being fixed. Its just that the reason has nothing to do with journalists sleeping with producers of indie games, it is the fact that the magazines get most of their revenues from advertising by the producers of the games they review.<br /><br />On the books thing, collapsing the three short form awards into one would allow awards for different types of novel. The logical new category that would come to mind is best novel that is part of a series.<br /><br />Right now there is evident pushback against blockbuster novels like ASOIAF and Harry Potter that threaten to swamp the best novel category simply because everyone who attends a con has heard of them which some see as an unfair advantage. It is a fair point. The printing of the final Harry Potter permanently changed the way books are printed and distributed in the US. The logistics of delivering a print run of 12 million copies on the day of release were quite hilariously extreme.<br /><br />Some people argue that such a situation is its own reward but it seems rather more sensible to recognize that these as two different categories.

I am trying to understand roughly what to expect if I register as an on-site participant and show up. Does it make sense, or it is not very meaningful for a reader, more for writers and very active members of the community?<br /><br />The closest event that I have attended is a scientific conference. Should I expect something similar: a formal agenda with talks, townhalls and panels, with one or two social events thrown in? Is it less formal? How many people attend? Is it possible to bump into GRRM between the events and chat for a few minutes, or he is assaulted by hordes of screaming fans and is actively hiding (I exaggerate ... maybe)?<br /><br />What's your advice, GRRM, hardcore fans/attendees?","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"May 18 2015, 22:13:16 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"What is Sasquan going to be like?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://crocobar.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"crocobar","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"crocobar","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://crocobar.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"crocobar","ctime_ts":1431987196,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21661635#t21661635","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21661635#t21661635","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21661635#t21661635","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":21661635,"talkid":84615,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/424643.html?thread=21661635#t21661635","above":21661379,"upictitle":"George R.R.
