There was part of the news segment that spoke about you receiving a lot of angry mail from fans of the show when the \"Red Wedding\" occurred in season 3. Firstly, I wanted to say THANK YOU for writing such an awesome series! Secondly, I think that every time you've killed off a character not only has their death made me cry, but also had a significant impact on me as a reader. I think that you've made excellent choices and the possibility that a character could die keeps me on the edge of my seat with anticipation. I think that you've definitely added to the literary genre in such a positive way by humanizing all your characters by allowing the reader to see their POV - which doesn't happen very often. <br /><br />I also wanted to add, that I personally don't care if it takes you 5+ year to finish Winds of Winter because personally, I know when I rush something it isn't necessarily my best work, and I feel that every time you've released a book it is the best version that it could have been. Lastly, I think if HBO even tries to take the show in any sort of direction that is not what's indicated in the books (because you haven't finished them) you should punch that executive in the face, just a quick chin check to let them know who's boss. Because when you think about it, the popularity of the show is due to the fact that the adaptation is so true to the books. <br /><br />Don't let them TrueBlood your series!<br /><br />Much respect!<br /><br />Your fan,<br /><br />Ezra :)","upictitle":"Ezra Azzopardi: pic#121975835","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"3 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"October 8 2013, 05:55:34 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"NPR broadcast","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ezra.azzopardi","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Ezra Azzopardi","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2209146","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=66716420&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Ezra Azzopardi","ctime_ts":1381211734,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/340484.html?thread=18331396#t18331396","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/340484.html?thread=18331396#t18331396","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/340484.html?thread=18331396#t18331396","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2209215","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://ext-2209215.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18331396,"talkid":71607,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/340484.html?thread=18331396#t18331396","upictitle":"Jaxon Mcquie: pic#121976112","article":"Ever since the Pats game I knew Geno Smith had this in him.

Rex Ryan is a good coach and he keeps the team competitive even with a lack of talent. They have a much better offensive coordinator than in the previous 2 that Sanchez was stuck with. Alot of short passes to help the offensive line (and Geno's tendency to hold the ball too long) and easy slant passes that he is good at. They made the gameplan easier for him.<br />no idea how good geno will be. The gameplan did not really showcase alot of talent. I am ok with that. I like a coach who works to someone's strength. <br /><br />on defense... it looks like Rex finally has some pash rushers. in the past, I used to dread 3rd and long. Rex would often go to the 'exotic' blitz package' they don't get there and then there is a first down. The jets seemed to do better in 3rd and short since Rex was less likely to blitz. The rush is a little better. I do think he takes too many chances and does too much 1 on 1 coverage (he doesn't have darelle revis anymore), but he is a good coach. <br /><br />i also like that rex is shutting up. I'm a jets fan, but I'm tired of his mouth. Rex is coaching for his job. Not sure he keeps it if the jets don't make the playoffs and I think that is a long shot. New GM usually wants a new coach.
