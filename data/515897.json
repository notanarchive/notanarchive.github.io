{"itemid":2015,"subject":"Greed Is Not Good","event":"The news just broke that the San Diego Chargers will be relocating to Los Angeles next season.\r\n\r\nSan Diego has loyally supported the team since the old AFL days in the early 60s.  Win or lose, the fans loved their Bolts.  \r\n\r\nLA has never supported any football team unless it was winning, and preferably winning big.  Once LA had two teams, and that was great when they won; when they hit down years, as all teams do, the Raiders and Rams were both abandoned.  That's why they left town twenty years ago, both in the same year.  Last year the Rams came back... but they lost, and before season's end, they were playing before tens of thousands of empty seats.\r\n\r\nI'd say the same fate awaits the Chargers, except I read that they will be playing in a small 30,000 seat venue for a couple years until the new Rams stadium (where they will be a tenant, like the Jets in old Giants Stadium) is complete.  That's smart, I suppose.  Nothing else about the move is.\r\n\r\nIt's all about greed.  And despite what you may have heard Gordon Gekko say, greed is NOT good.  (Too many people seem to lose sight of the fact that he was the VILLAIN of that film).\r\n\r\nI am a fan of the Giants and Jets, both of whom have great loyal fan bases and seem likely to remain where they are for decades to come... but I know what it is to have your heart torn out when a greedy owner moves your team away.  When I was a child, I was a Dodgers fan... the <i><b>Brooklyn</b></i> Dodgers, thank you very much, the Boys of Summer, one of baseball's great iconic franchises, playing in one of baseball's great iconic ballparks, Ebbets Field.  The Dodgers were the heart and soul of Brooklyn; never has a city loved a team so much, or had so much of its identity bound up with them.  The city that was Brooklyn died when the Dodgers departed; the gentrified borough that remains is just a bedroom community for Manhattan.  (Okay, they still have fantastic pizza, gotta give 'em that).\r\n \r\nThe Dodger fans (and the fans of the baseball Giants, similarly bereft) eventually got the Mets, which helped some... especially in '69 and '86... but the pain is still there, down deep, when we think back on it.  Ebbets Field was old and run-down and small, yeah, but it was wonderful in the same way that Fenway Park and Wrigley Field are wonderful.  Those ballparks have become legendary and historic, cherished by the people of Boston and Chicago respectively, and I don't think anyone would dare to tear them down now.  The same thing would have happened to Ebbets Field if only it had lasted a few more years and managed to survive the fad for building hideous concrete multi-purpose stadiums that dominated the 60s.  (And indeed that is exactly what has happened in the Wild Cards universe, an alternate world where Walter O'Malley contracted the wild card virus before he could move the team.  He turned into a pile of slime, but it was days before anyone noticed the difference).\r\n\r\nMaybe because of my early childhood trauma at losing the Dodgers, I have never liked the various relocations that have plagued both football and baseball over the decades.  The ONLY cases where I think it is warranted are those where a city stops supporting its team or teams... as happened in LA with the Raiders and the Rams.  But the rest?  Bob Irsay slinking out of Baltimore in the dead of night with the Colts?  Despicable.  Al Davis abandoning Oakland, spending a decade in LA, then moving back?  Offensive.  Art Modell moving the Browns from Cleveland?  Shame, shame.  \r\n\r\nCleveland did get a new Browns team, so at least they got to keep the name and tradition (though the original Browns, now the Ravens, are a perennial contender who won a SuperBowl after the move, while the expansion Browns have pretty much sucked since they were reborn, so it was hardly a fair swap).  The good fans of Baltimore did not even get that.  The 'Colts' name and colors should have stayed when Irsay left.  Let the Indianapolis team start fresh with a new name and uni, as the Ravens did.  It would be splendid if the NFL would rule that Spanos can move his team, but the name 'Chargers' and the lightning bolt and the powder blues should all remain with San Diego, for however long it takes for them to get an expansion team.  The relocated team can be the LA Earthquakes, since I think their tenure in Lalaland is going to be pretty shaky.  If what I read is true, neither the city nor the Rams <i><b>want</b></i> them there.  \r\n\r\nGreen Bay has the right idea.  The Packers are owned by the people of Green Bay.  Would that were true in more cities.  If I were only a billionaire (not even close, sorry), I'd buy an NFL franchise and leave it to the city upon my death... except, alas, I am told that NFL rules no longer allow that.  So there will never be another Green Bay, and the billionaire owners will continue to move their teams around the country in search of ever newer, bigger, glitzier stadiums paid for by the fans and taxpayers, stadiums that can generate hundreds of millions in profits instead of merely tens of millions.\r\n\r\nCharger fans, I feel for you.","ditemid":515897,"eventtime":"2017-01-12 16:54:00","props":{"current_mood":"annoyed","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"nfl","crosspost_tw_log":"[Thu Jan 12 23:54:19 2017]R [Thu Jan 12 23:54:20 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/819694028560224257 ","current_moodid":3,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1484691172,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/819694028560224257","picture_keyword":"thumbs down","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.721610844656902]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1484265316}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2015?v=1484683238","revtime":1484683234},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-12 23:54:16","anum":57,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html","event_timestamp":1484240040,"reply_count":80,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122744757/66446294","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25582905#t25582905","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25582905#t25582905","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25582905#t25582905","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2182595","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/jasmine.townsel","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25582905,"talkid":99933,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25582905#t25582905","upictitle":"Jasmine Townsel: pic#122744757","article":"Hey there, as a Ravens fan I know Many people who still remember the day they woke up and he Colts were gone.

I've always been a diehard Red Wings fan, and every year since I was a kid I've went to a single game at the Joe Louis Arena with my dad, but now it's getting replaced. I, was among other people hoping that the new stadium would honor the city and the franchise rather than a business and would have a name along the lines of \"Gordie Howe Arena,\" after losing him last year. But alas, the new stadium won't have a giant wing's logo, it will have the largest Little Caesar's logo in the world, and will share a name with Mike Illitch's business. I've always thought it was important to a teams success when the owner had a shared passion with their fans and wanted to maintain the respect it deserved. I don't particularly like the Yankees, but I still find it admirable that they play in Yankee's Field and not some corporate branded field. I can't help but feel like professional sports is really losing some of it's heart when it becomes more and more about the money.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 13 2017, 03:23:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Greed proliferates every element of professional sports ","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://matthewgschafer.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"matthewgschafer","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"matthewgschafer","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://matthewgschafer.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"matthewgschafer","ctime_ts":1484277780,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/8700085/654814","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25589817#t25589817","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25589817#t25589817","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25589817#t25589817","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jeffreyab","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jeffreyab.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25589817,"talkid":99960,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25589817#t25589817","upictitle":"Jeff: Me","article":"Word is the Raiders are on their way to Las Vegas real soon now.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 13 2017, 03:45:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jeffreyab.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jeffreyab","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jeffreyab","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jeffreyab.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jeffreyab","ctime_ts":1484279155,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/124725240/74747654","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25590073#t25590073","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25590073#t25590073","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25590073#t25590073","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25590073#t25590073","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3061401","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/1109685221","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25590073,"talkid":99961,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25590073#t25590073","upictitle":"Michael Boettcher: pic#124725240","article":"I think that Art Modell is unjustly demonized.  Yes the fans of Cleveland have always been loyal.  The same can not be said of their elected officials.  Before Modell moved the team, he was only asking for upgrades to Cleveland's current stadium.  He was put off again and again as the city built the Jake and the convention center were the Cav's play.  All the while he was losing money as his stadium was no longer competitive.  The officials thought he was one of the old guard and would never move, and so they could take advantage of him.  He called their bluff.  Low and behold they found the money to build an entirely new stadium after he was gone.  One of the other villains in this story is Jack Kent Cook.  Baltimore should have had one of the earlier expansion franchises, probably the one that ended up in Jacksonville.  The package the city and ownership team put together was light years better than any of the other cities in consideration.  JKC didn't want a team that close to his terrible Redskins and so he blocked it.  So if Cleveland and the NFL had done what was right.  The Browns would never have moved, there wouldn't be a failing franchise in Jacksonville, and Baltimore would be rooting for the Bombers.  That was the proposed name for the expansion team to be based there.

Granted, it is a big change and thus you have to adapt and that is a challenge. Heck, all year I've been saying \"St. Louis Rams\", only to correct myself.<br /><br />However, a move, a name change, can create change and movement. Give new life back to an organization. Which is what the Chargers need. They've maintained a decent team but in the long-end, they've been stuck in this stalemale. Same as the Rams. They maintained a playoff existence in early 2000's after their great Super bowl win in 1999 but then nothing. Unless you were a devoted fan, they weren't really talked about. This year didn't produce the results they wanted but perhaps another coach and better draft picks will change that.<br /><br />And really it was only by Ravens branching out and becoming a new team gave a new energy and life to football. Their fan base grew and both the presence of the Ravens and newly-changed Indianapolis Colts increased. They became separate but comparable entities.<br /><br />Yes, at the focus it is about the money and looking for other financial opportunities. However, you are only looking at one facet and reason for the move. Fans change opinions when their favorite players leave their favorite teams and go to others so why can't they do the same by changing cities? Psychologically speaking, if you love your team it doesn't matter who the QB is, where they're located, their stats or record, or what they are called. The important thing is that it's YOUR team and you support them no matter what. If you can't do that, you aren't a true fan.<br /><br />And really, Charger fans have nothing to complain about compared to Rams fans. A couple hour drive is all that awaits them because they're staying in the same state. Ram fans have to take a plane, train or other vehicle to travel across half the US if they'd like to go to a game.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"4 months ago","ctime":"January 13 2017, 04:55:41 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://evilcleo.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"evilcleo","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"evilcleo","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://evilcleo.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"evilcleo","ctime_ts":1484283341,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125734873/77256848","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25591353#t25591353","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25591353#t25591353","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25591353#t25591353","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"mikzey","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://mikzey.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25591353,"talkid":99966,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/515897.html?thread=25591353#t25591353","upictitle":"Mike Pirhonen-Cutter: pic#125734873","article":"I support an English football team and instead of relocating to a new bigger stadium my team (the mighty Spurs) are merely expanding our current stadium.
