What made this one fresh and different was that Mahvesh invited me to select ten favorite songs to play during the program. That was a lot of fun, and surprisingly hard: I could easily have come up with fifty songs. Anyway, check this one out, and you will also get to hear some great bands and singers, and some songs that, for one reason or another, have inspired and influenced me.\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/cityfm89/georgerrmartin-on-89-chapters-with-mahvesh\r\n\r\nHappy listening.","ditemid":385506,"eventtime":"2014-10-11 00:19:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"travels, interviews","current_moodid":91,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1414681565,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"More Interviews http://j.mp/1EG3hc9","picture_keyword":"sword","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"revnum":1,"interface":"web","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revtime":1414974670},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-10-11 06:18:52","anum":226,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/385506.html","event_timestamp":1412986740,"reply_count":19,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/123721201/71653468","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/385506.html?thread=19627234#t19627234","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/385506.html?thread=19627234#t19627234","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/385506.html?thread=19627234#t19627234","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"iroberts007","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://iroberts007.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19627234,"talkid":76668,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/385506.html?thread=19627234#t19627234","article":"Thanks for posting that Comic Con video with the Marvel related interview; it brought a big smile to my face.

Also agree on Hank Pym, he could've been used in place of the Stellan Skarsgard character in the first movie and then brought along in the second movie.

I love the discussion of naming conventions.  <br /><br />A few years ago I encountered a creative writing lecturer who believed \"Never give 2 characters names starting with the same letter.\"  Funnily enough, both myself and another member of the class- also a fan of yours! - had done it and we'd both used brothers!  <br /><br />In my case the names were carefully chosen to reflect the world I was writing in, and had very specific connotations that the lecturer clearly didn't understand, so I was annoyed that the issue had even been raised.  I'd been a fan of ASOIAF for almost 14 years at that point so I found the idea of confusing readers with the names of 2 characters rather bizarre!  Worse, the lecturer had never even heard of ASOIAF or Game of Thrones (a major heresy in my mind!)<br /><br />I changed one of the names to please her but it didn't feel right at all.   I'm definitely going to change it back when I have the time and inclination to work on that particular story again!

There's been some criticism from some people that the show favors female nudity over male nudity. There may or may not be some merit to that argument.<br /><br />So I think they intentionally went in the exact opposite direction as a reference to that, especially since one of the characters becomes obsessed with that over everything else the show has to offer. I think Cartman says something like, \"You're focusing on the wrong stuff!\" (in a much funnier manner of course). At least that's my take on it. Knowing Matt and Trey, they may have just thought it was funny that their version of you is obsessed with wieners! It's hard to know for sure.
