I'm sure he was a great football player.<br /><br />But... I'd also just like to say that ... I also send my best wishes to you Mr. Martin. I have read the past couple threads about the trolls and morons who have been bashing you and the books.<br /><br />I too, have read the comments by the trolls and I'll be honest, it fumed me. You're the best right now in fantasy, and you leave a tough act to follow for everyone else. Your books are master-pieces that can only be appreciated by those who have patience. Not only in waiting for the next book to arrive, but patience in fully understand the depth and beauty of your writing. You are, in my mind atleast, a perfect author who accepts nothing but the best in your writing and what you deliver to your fans.<br /><br />I've posted several comments on youtube, bashing the critics and trolls. One in the Ice Dragon video by Tor/Forge.<br /><br />On a final note... I've read the post page many times about 'Dance' (the one that states the progress and how you don't plan to update it until 'Dance' is done). I have to say, it was sad to hear that you missed conventions in '07 that you haven't missed in over a decade, consistent, in times past. Well... ignore the trolls, ignore the critics, DON'T MISS THE CONVENTIONS. Not only are they fun for you, but they're a unique opportunity for your loyal fans to have a chance to meet their icon. I know I'd love to have an opportunity to meet you. But it is sad to hear that you've broken a long standing record of going to your traditional haunts once a year.<br /><br />At any rate. Didn't mean to detract from the main subject of the thread, if this post is moved I can understand... Keep fighting the good fight, I am eager to read 'Dance' but my better side tells me that the wait is worth it. And when it comes out all will be well, because you are an excellent author who accepts nothing but the best from yourself and the product you give to your fans.<br /><br /><br />A Dedicated Reader,<br />Luke","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"8 years ago","ctime":"February 22 2009, 04:43:06 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Prayers and best wishes...","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://icewind87.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"icewind87","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"icewind87","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://icewind87.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"icewind87","ctime_ts":1235277786,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/20411596/4337561","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75542.html?replyto=5514518","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75542.html?thread=5514518#t5514518","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75542.html?thread=5514518#t5514518","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75542.html?thread=5514518#t5514518","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"fastfwd","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://fastfwd.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":5514518,"talkid":21541,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/75542.html?thread=5514518#t5514518","upictitle":"fastfwd: Calgary","article":"The sound you heard was my jaw hitting the floor.<br /><br />No, I'm not generally known as a football fan.
