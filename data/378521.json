{"itemid":1478,"subject":"Comicon Is Coming","event":"It seems like I just got back from France and Switzerland... maybe because I just did... and now San Diego Comicon is on top of us.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll be there for the whole weekend, doing promotion for HBO, Bantam Spectra, and my various other publishers.&nbsp; Flying in Wednesday, departing on the following Monday, so if you&#39;re going to comicon, you should have plenty of chances to see me, hear me, and get me to scrawl illegibly on your book, graphic novel, Blu-Rays, or body parts.\r\n\r\nMy schedule:\r\n\r\nWednesday evening, 6pm to 7pm, I will be doing a signing at the AVATAR PRESS booth, autographing copies of the SKIN TRADE graphic novel and IN THE HOUSE OF THE WORM comic.&nbsp; (Only those, please.&nbsp; There will be other places and times to get my other stuff signined).\r\n\r\nThursday, 2:30 to 3:30, I will be appearing in the main autograph area (the Sails) at Table 3, with DONATO GIANCOLA.&nbsp; The two of us will be signing copies of the 2015 Ice &amp; Fire calendar, which will be making its debut at the convention.\r\n\r\nThursday, 4:00 to 5:00 pm, you can catch me in the Indigo Room, where I&#39;ll be joining William Christensen of Avatar to talk about THE SKIN TRADE and IN THE HOUSE OF THE WORM.&nbsp; (No signing here, this is just a talk).\r\n\r\nFriday, we have the GAME OF THRONES panel in Hall H.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be there, with showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss and various members of our cast.&nbsp; This year CRAIG FERGUSON will be moderating.&nbsp; Hall H seats 7,000 people... but of course 150,000 people attend comicon, so if you want to see the panel, best get in line... ah... now.&nbsp; Afterward I will join the cast for interviews and a poster signing and more interviews.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 11:00 am to 12 noon, I return to the Sails for a Random House autograph session.&nbsp; This time I will be at Table 7.&nbsp; This is the time and place to get your books signed.&nbsp; Copies will be on sale in the autograph area, if you don&#39;t want to drag your old ones to San Diego.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 4:15 pm to 5:15 pm, I&#39;ll be in Room 6A for a panel on epic fantasy, part of an all-star lineup of panelists with Patrick Rothfuss, Joe Abercrombie, and others.\r\n\r\nSunday, 12:30 to 1:30, back to the floor for another signing.&nbsp; This time I will be signing copies of the HEDGE KNIGHT and SWORN SWORD graphic novels at the ComiXology booth, on behalf of Jet City Comics.\r\n\r\nSunday, 2:00pm to 4:00pm, I will be judging a costume contest sponsored by Courtyard Marriott.\r\n\r\nMonday I go home.\r\n\r\nGiven the sheer numbers of people in San Diego for comicon, I regret to say that I will sign autographs ONLY at the designated signings.&nbsp; There are, you will note, five of them, which means I&#39;ll be scrawling my name for five hours at various points through the weekend.&nbsp; That&#39;s about all I can manage.&nbsp; So if you should happen to see me walking the floor, riding a pedicab through the GasLamp, having a drink or eating my dinner, feel free to smile or wave or say hi, but PLEASE do not ask me to sign anything.&nbsp; I can only do so much, and I do need some time just to enjoy the con and chill with friends.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nSee you in San Diego.","ditemid":378521,"eventtime":"2014-07-21 10:43:00","props":{"current_mood":"busy","current_location":"Santa Fe... for now","taglist":"conventions, signings, comicon, comic books","current_moodid":91,"commentalter":1407007028,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"Morocco","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":3,"interface":"web","revtime":1409342089},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2014-07-21 16:43:35","anum":153,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378521.html","event_timestamp":1405939380,"reply_count":37,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/119871300/2771344","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378521.html?thread=19361945#t19361945","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378521.html?thread=19361945#t19361945","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378521.html?thread=19361945#t19361945","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378521.html?thread=19361945#t19361945","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"redfield79","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://redfield79.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":19361945,"talkid":75632,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/378521.html?thread=19361945#t19361945","upictitle":"LMF-AO: Wake Up","article":"I request you cease speaking of things like this.<br /><br />We get NOTHING like this here.

I dont know if you'll ever read this but I thought I would try. I am an african-american female and have been a devoted fan of GOT since the beginning but the lack of diversity in both the show and books has really been troubling lately. With the state of racial equality currently in the world and the people that have been trying to push back, I am extremely sad that I can not include my favorite, Game of Thrones, as an example of \"hollywood\" starting to change how race is depicted. So far in the series there has only been one black woman with a speaking role and while i love that she's getting a romantic storyline too but that hasn't been enough for me. I know its not something you focus on while writing the extremely complex storylines but it would be nice to dress as someone other than Black Daenerys for a change. I don't know if this will make a difference but I wanted you to know that I will keep on hoping for a change. I've seen the new cast and I applaud the casting of DeObia Oparei but must all black people in the series be servants, guards, or charlatans? I don't know what i'm expecting but I just wanted to let you know that feeling this way really hurts. Still my favorite show and whenever I figure out how you all hire set crew, I will fight to the death of any position, anything to help my favorite show ever.
