I didn't know where else to post this. <br /><br />As the release of Winds of Winter draws nearer, I can't help feeling deeply concerned about who will be brought on to narrate it (and book 7). <br /><br />While he's one of the all-time greats, we all know Roy Dotrice will be too old when WoW drops; he's too old now at 92, and frankly, was already getting too old to have read book 5. His recollections of the accents used for each character and even how to pronounce their names has dwindled with the past couple of books. I realize as the author, this is not necessarily in your control, however, I have to think the folks at Random House Audio will listen to your recommendation.<br /><br />As an avid listener, I have two suggestions I hope you'll consider:<br /><br />Stephen Frye (1st choice) - he read the British version of Harry Potter and is excellent. His range, his acting ability are extraordinary.<br /><br />Jim Dale (2nd choice) - he read the International version of Harry Potter and many more. Also excellent, though not quite as good as Frye.<br /><br />We all agree that John Lee's reading for A Feast for Crows was a bomb, as evidenced by bringing Dotrice back in to re-do it. Please let's learn from this and not have Lee come in for these important final installments of this incredible series.<br /><br />Lastly, a deep bow of gratitude to you, Sir. Your writing...just wow. The world you've created, the characters, it's almost too much to bare. <br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Tobin Poppenberg","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"March 14 2016, 21:43:28 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"A plea from a Song of Ice and Fire Audiobook-o-file","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tobinp.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tobinp","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tobinp","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tobinp.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"tobinp","ctime_ts":1457991808,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24167564#t24167564","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24167564#t24167564","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24167564#t24167564","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"redhelldiver","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://redhelldiver.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24167564,"talkid":94404,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24167564#t24167564","upictitle":"redhelldiver: pic#0","article":"As a fan of both cagematch teams and both book series -- I always recommend Red Rising to friends as Game of Thrones meets Star Wars -- it's really exciting to imagine the Reaper taking on the Kingslayer.

The Dance featurette visually presents Vhagar as sort of a pale green color - somewhat like the official artwork in the World book.  So, officially, what color was Vhagar?<br /><br />2 - What race did you intend for the dragonrider Nettles to be?  She is consistently described as a \"small brown girl\", and when I read that I took it to mean that it was a sort of Sarella Sand situation, she was a bastard fathered on a Summer Islander woman or something.  Maybe it mean she \"looked\" Dornish/Latino etc.  Fanart also generally interpreted that she wasn't North European looking like the Lannisters.  I ask because she actually does appear in the Dance of Dragons featurette, and the artwork depicts her as black/Africa/Summer Islander in appearance.  Does this match your intent?<br /><br />3 - The video refers to Rhaenys, the Queen Who Never Was, as \"the old king's sister\" - even though she was actually Viserys I's first cousin.  It also mentions that she was Rhaenyra's mother in law from her first marriage to Laenor - so was this an official change (much like Jaehaerys II) to simplify things in \"the TV continuity\", or was it merely a dialogue error because they thought it would take too long to explain their convoluted relationship?  Yes I know you don't write these featurettes directly -- but over on Game of Thrones Wiki, I've got to write up the family tree diagram for the TV continuity.  <br /><br />4 - At one point in the video Viserys III narrates that \"there were 18 dragons at the start of the Dance and only 2 by the end\", stunted creatures the size of cats.  Now in the main novels Tyrion does recall that the last two dragon skulls belonged to stunted creatures (though Dunk said Ser Arlan saw *one* dragon of that size) -- World of Ice and Fire said only four survived (Silverwing, Sheepstealer, the Cannibal, and the new hatchling Morning).  But fair enough, within 20 years and still during Aegon III's reign only \"two\" dragons were left, broadly speaking.  <br /><br />...yet there's no way to reconcile the line about \"18\" dragons:  even within the video's own continuity, if you count up the number of dragons they name, mention, or depict, it doesn't add up to 18.  In the books of course, there were *20* dragons at the start of the Dance:  one super-heavyweight (Vhagar), eight heavyweights, eight medium to lightweights, and three hatchlings too small to ride.  <br /><br />The video mentions that Aegon II's faction had \"four\" dragons - it indeed had four adult ones, so I figured he was just going by ridable ones.  Then it says by name that Rhaenyra's side had three big ones (Meleys, Caraxes, Syrax), and her three eldest sons also had three.  Then it says there were six \"wild\" dragons - so we've got 12.<br /><br />12 plus 4 is 16.  Then we see Stormcloud die saving Aegon III...bringing us up to 17.  The hachlings Morghul and Shrykos were introduced in the sense that they appear on screen as the \"four dragons\" killed in the Storming of the Dragonpit, they appear on-screen (though unnamed), bringing us up to 19. <br /><br />(for that matter, the video describes Rhaenyra's \"youngest\" son as riding back to Dragonstone on Stormcloud.  By gumbo, this was quite a mistake, as Viserys II was actually her youngest son)<br /><br />Only the twentieth dragon, Moondancer, was never referred to or even seen in the video  <br /><br />So no matter how you count them - actual names given, numbers given, visibly different dragons given, there's no way that the dragons in the 20 minute Dance of Dragons featurette add up to \"18\".  <br /><br />But this is all dithering.  I was utterly in love with the video and I'm very happy we got it, the artwork was amazing as was the narration - particularly ingenious move to have Oberyn Martell narrating the actions of his own ancestor/archetype Daemon Targaryen!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"March 15 2016, 01:17:34 UTC","parent":24167820,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: NYC Season 5 Blu-ray event","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/ADragonDemands","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"ADragonDemands","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2902334","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73354478&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"ADragonDemands","ctime_ts":1458004654,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125975630/77615136","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24168076#t24168076","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24168076#t24168076","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24168076#t24168076","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3564477","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/540832562762185/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24168076,"talkid":94406,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/478348.html?thread=24168076#t24168076","upictitle":"Jeremy Amacher: pic#125975630","article":"Just wanted to give you a shout out!! I got laid off on December 17th of last year and had a lot of time on my hands. The only book I really read up to this point in my life was The Hobbit. So I read that, then the Lord of the Rings and then I thought what now? I have been watching Game of Thrones since the beginning and wasn't the biggest fan because I really didn't understand what the hell was going on. Also I never thought anything could be as good as Lord of The Rings. Boy was I wrong. I am on Feast of Crows right now and just started reading your books around the beginning of January. Man I can't wait until Winds of Winter!!! Take your time though! :) It'll hit when it hits and dam will it be good!!! Roy Dotrice is amazing! I read when I can and listen in the car on the way home from work. (Got a new Job now. :)) Just wanted thank you for doing what you do and opening my eyes to reading once again. I can't wait to dabble in some other epic series. Best of luck to one of the GREATS!!!! <br /><br />P.S. You need to make a Cameo is Game of Thrones at the very end with a wink and a nod. <br /><br />Best line in the books so far. Midgets Fighting. They hop on the wrong mounts. \"It took a while to sort it all out\". I laughed so hard at this and still do. Alright I will shut up now.
