{"itemid":61,"subject":"Eight Things About Me","event":"Melinda Snodgrass has \"tagged\" me, she informs me.  And now I must reveal eight things about myself.  Presumably eight things that I haven't revealed before, or at least not widely, or else what fun would it be?\r\n\r\nSo... eight things about me that most of you would probably never suspect.\r\n\r\n1) The first vote I ever cast was for a Republican, New Jersey's distinguished senior senator and favorite son, Clifford B. Case.\r\n\r\n2) I had a crew cut all through junior high, high school, and most of college.\r\n\r\n3) My favorite guilty pleasure movie is SUMMER LOVERS.  I want to go to the island of Santorini and have a menage a trois with Darryl Hannah and Valerie Quinessen.\r\n\r\n4) When I was in my twenties people used to tell me I looked like Kris Kristofferson.  Now they tell me I look like Jerry Garcia.  And he's dead.  I don't like this trend.\r\n\r\n5) I like writing when it's going well, but I LOVE having written.\r\n\r\n6) My favorite song is Kris Kristofferson's \"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33.\"  (See him busted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans, wearing yesterday's misfortunes like a smile).  I am also very fond of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" and \"To Beat the Devil\" and \"Silver\" and a lot of Kris's other songs.  Maybe that's why I was pleased when people said I looked like him. \r\n\r\n7) I have never been defeated at RISK when I have the red army.   Never.  And I started playing RISK in grade school.  Foemen tremble when I rattle my dice.  Except when they make me play green or black or some other color.  Then I am merely mortal.\r\n\r\n8) Windows sucks.  I use it, under protest, for the internet, but all my fiction is written on a DOS machine, using WordStar 4.0.  I'm a word guy.  When I want to copy something, I like to type \"copy.\"  When I want to delete it, I like to type \"delete.\"  I don't like puzzling out these stupid little cartoons they call icons, or dragging them around with a mouse.  The day WordStar 4.0 stops working is the day I retire.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  My revelations.  \r\n\r\nAnd now, if I understand the rules of this \"game of eight\" correctly, I must tag someone else, just as Melinda tagged me.  Let me look around.  Hmmmmm, who... ah...\r\n\r\nSTEVE LEIGH!  You're tagged!","ditemid":15851,"eventtime":"2007-05-18 01:29:00","props":{"commentalter":1292888709,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2007-05-18 07:51:40","anum":235,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15851.html","event_timestamp":1179451740,"reply_count":85,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/3220700/702762","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15851.html?replyto=1914859","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15851.html?thread=1914859#t1914859","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15851.html?thread=1914859#t1914859","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15851.html?thread=1914859#t1914859","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"throwingshapes","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://throwingshapes.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1914859,"talkid":7479,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/15851.html?thread=1914859#t1914859","upictitle":"Pulling back, changing shape: pic#3220700","article":"Whoo !
