Not b/c I thought you got the most flak for his death but b/c his sticks out the most in my mind. Before Game of Thrones the last time I had encountered the death of a character that I loved was when I was 10 reading Bridge to Tarabithia. After Ned's death I felt I had changed as a reader. And honestly I like the suspense. It makes the story feel that much more real. Sure the Red Wedding was hard to read but it didnt have quite the same effect on me as that first gut wrenching death of the \"good guy\" did. So thanks for keeping us on our toes even if it does piss us off when we lose beloved characters!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 years ago","ctime":"November 28 2007, 03:28:31 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"interview","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grateblue2.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grateblue2","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grateblue2","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grateblue2.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grateblue2","ctime_ts":1196220511,"tracked":0}]}
