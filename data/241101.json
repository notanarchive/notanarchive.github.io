{"itemid":941,"subject":"Croatia Gets The Gold","event":"Sorry, Portugal.\r\n\r\nWhen I put up the post about my Portuguese publisher winning the gold medal for being the first to release a translation of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS (see below), a number of readers in Croatia wrote me to say, no, the Croatian edition was out first.  I had not seen the Croatian edition, or even a jpeg of its cover... but now I have.\r\n\r\nThey were right.  Croatia was first.  Portugal was second.  Croatia gets the gold, Portugal the silver.  (The bronze remains to be determined, so far as I know).  Both Croatia and Portugal split the book into two volumes, and have thusfar released only the first half.\r\n\r\nHere's the Croatian cover for volume one of DANCE:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hhrw4/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hhrw4\" width=\"300\" height=\"461\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnd here's their cover for the second part, which is not yet published, but is in the pipeline and should be out soon:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hke4s/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000hke4s\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, filming of the second season of the HBO series in currently underway in Dubrovnik, so Croatia is doubly blessed.  A lot of Croatians have been hired as extras and crew, and a few have speaking roles as well.\r\n\r\nPortugal, on the other hand, gets a visit from me next spring.\r\n\r\nSo everybody wins.  I hope.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the read, whatever language you may be reading in.","ditemid":241101,"eventtime":"2011-09-30 11:55:00","props":{"taglist":"foreign editions, a dance with dragons","commentalter":1318045936,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"passport","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","revnum":2,"revtime":1318286161},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2011-09-30 17:57:42","anum":205,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html","event_timestamp":1317383700,"reply_count":35,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/105285638/10375417","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14780621#t14780621","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14780621#t14780621","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14780621#t14780621","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"trumko","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://trumko.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14780621,"talkid":57736,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14780621#t14780621","article":"unfortunately your books are not translated into Ukrainian at all...","upictitle":"Trumko: pic#105285638","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"5 years ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"September 30 2011, 18:26:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://trumko.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"trumko","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"trumko","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://trumko.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"trumko","ctime_ts":1317407187,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/37965559/4449070","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14783949#t14783949","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14783949#t14783949","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14783949#t14783949","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"dilitant","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://dilitant.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":14783949,"talkid":57749,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/241101.html?thread=14783949#t14783949","above":14780621,"upictitle":"ДилетантЪ: - Че эта!?","article":"Ну это разве проблема?
