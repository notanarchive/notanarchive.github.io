{"itemid":1934,"subject":"Three Years and Counting","event":"Hard to believe, but we are coming up on the third anniversary of the re-opening of the Jean Cocteau Cinema.   Santa Fe's hometown movie theatre, and first art house, had been dark for seven years when we turned on the lights again and opened the doors in August 2013.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, that calls for a celebration... <i><b>a week-long celebration</b></i>, in fact!!!\r\n\r\nTo mark the occasion, we are bringing back three very special films, movies that have a special significance in the history of the JJC, New Mexico's most eclectic movie theatre.\r\n\r\nFirst up we will have PANDORA'S BOX, a classic of the silent cinema starring Louise Brooks, the first film to play the Jean Cocteau when the theatre first opened in 1984.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"761\"/>\r\n\r\nWe will also show FORBIDDEN PLANET, the first film shown at the reborn Cocteau three years ago... and also the greatest science fiction film ever made, in my not so humble opinion.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"762\"/>\r\n\r\nAnd finally we will have DARK STAR, our first midnight movie from three years back, a hilarious SF comedy, and the movie that gave Dan O'Bannon and John Carpenter their starts.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"763\"/>\r\n\r\n<i><b><span style=\"font-size: 1.8em\">Best of all, admission to all three movies will be FREE!</span></b></i>  (We will also be holding over a couple other films this week, and offering discount $5 admissions on those).\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, ROBBIE THE ROBOT will be returning to the cinema for the celebrations, along with his friends Altaira, Commander J.J. Adams, and the Iron Giant.\r\n\r\nWe'll be celebrating all week... but the BIG party will be on Saturday at 7:00 pm, when we will be adding some cake to the mix.  And our friends at Jambo are sending their foot truck around that night at well, for some delicious African treats.\r\n\r\nANNIVERSARY WEEK SCHEDULE:\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, JULY 29TH:\r\n2:30 PM: Yarn ($5.00)\r\n4:30 PM: Pandora’s Box (FREE)\r\n7:00 PM: Forbidden Planet (FREE)\r\n9:30 PM: Showcase Karaoke (with Cyndi and Nanci) (FREE)\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, JULY 30TH:\r\n2:15 PM: The Fallen Idol ($5.00)\r\n4:30 PM: Pandora’s Box (FREE)\r\n7:00 PM: Anniversary Party (Cake, Costumes, Games, Food Trucks, & More!)

The chains are relentless, and the studios and distributors favor the big boys at every turn.   The only way to compete is to offer a better all-around movie-going experience: better popcorn, good food, a full bar, special events and promotions, a friendly and engaged staff who actually care that you are there.<br /><br />The JCC also regularly features other sorts of entertainment: magic shows, author readings, booksignings, live music, stand-up comedy.  And we're available for rent for weddings and bar mitzahs.  We are as much a community center as we are a theatre.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"9 months ago","ctime":"July 28 2016, 20:30:45 UTC","parent":24812425,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: So, how&#39;s business?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"grrm","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"grrm","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"grrm","ctime_ts":1469737845,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125210192/70950218","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/495241.html?thread=24815497#t24815497","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/495241.html?thread=24815497#t24815497","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/495241.html?thread=24815497#t24815497","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cashcraig","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cashcraig.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24815497,"talkid":96935,"etime_ts":"1469740001","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/495241.html?thread=24815497#t24815497","above":24815241,"upictitle":"Cash Craig: pic#125210192","article":"The JCC sounds like a cornerstone of the community.<br /><br />Do you have any additions or expansions planned?
