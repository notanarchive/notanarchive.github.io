{"itemid":1086,"subject":"NFL Draft, Round One","event":"Obviously, I should never go on long trips just before the NFL draft.  I was woefully unprepared this year, having barely glanced at the stack of pre-draft magazines I always buy, and I'd hardly seen any mock drafts at all.  \r\n\r\nAnd I fear, without the help of my telepathic advice from Santa Fe, that Rex Ryan and Mike Tannenbaum may have made a terrible mistake.  I am not at all happy with their choice of Quinton Coples.  Yes, we needed a pass rusher, sure... but there were a lot of them on the board when the Jets turn arrived at 16, so I cannot understand why they chose a kid that all the draftniks seem to agree is a physically gifted underachiever who gives minimum effort and does not really love the game.  Coples has Vernon Gholston II written all over him.\r\n\r\nAnd I fear that Evil Little Bill, picking later, got a much better prospect at a lower slot.  Actually Evil Little Bill and the despised Pats got TWO terrific players, who will vastly improve the Pats D (of course, bad as it was, there was no place to go but up).  How does he DO that, year after year?  A Satanic pact, methinks...\r\n\r\nThe Giants, picking last in the round, had fewer great options, and ended up choosing a running back.  Well, okay... with Big Brandon gone, we need a new RB to spell Ahmad.  This Wilson guy has blazing speed and is very elusive, they say.  That's good.  Maybe he can return punts and kickoffs.  The G-Men have sucked at both for the past couple of years.  On the other hand, they also say he fumbles a lot.  That's less good.  I have to hope Tom Coughlin can fix his fumbling, the same way he once fixed Tiki Barber's.\r\n\r\nCleveland had a good first round, I think.  Miami picked their latest QB bust, by all reports.  And reached for him as well.  From everything I read about this Tannehill kid, they will do better sticking with Matt Moore.\r\n\r\nBased on this single round, though, looks as though Belichick tightened the Pats grip on the AFC East for years to come.  The Jets, Bills, and Dolphins did nothing to improve their teams, while the Pats got significently better on D.  mutter mutter mutter\r\n\r\nThe Panthers got the player the Giants really needed.","ditemid":278089,"eventtime":"2012-04-27 09:18:00","props":{"current_location":"home","taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":85,"commentalter":1336666743,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"jets 1","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","revnum":1,"interface":"web","revtime":1336806772},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2012-04-27 15:18:27","anum":73,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html","event_timestamp":1335518280,"reply_count":59,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/117088941/48885827","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15899465#t15899465","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15899465#t15899465","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15899465#t15899465","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1182645","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/RobertFiorentino","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15899465,"talkid":62107,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15899465#t15899465","upictitle":"Robert Fiorentino: pic#117088941","article":"As if the Jets needed another player with character and discipline issues.

From everything I read about this Tannehill kid, they will do better sticking with Matt Moore.</i><br /><br />Actually, I think the press on Tannehill is pretty good aside from his lack of starts. The big controversy seems to be why the Dolphins used the first-round <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/rsearch/?tags=%238\">#8</a> pick on him when no one else seemed to be in the market for QBs. If they'd traded down, they could have gotten more later picks and saved some money on what they now have to pay a high first-round pick.<br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"April 28 2012, 13:43:15 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"smofbabe","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"smofbabe","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"smofbabe","ctime_ts":1335620595,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/116255540/47010435","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15908425#t15908425","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15908425#t15908425","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15908425#t15908425","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15908425#t15908425","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_1077983","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1129222971","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15908425,"talkid":62142,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15908425#t15908425","above":15907401,"upictitle":"Greg White: pic#116255540","article":"^^^^ This.

Sedinger: pic#117099085","article":"I'm sorry, Mr. Martin, but your claim that the Bills did nothing to improve their team makes zero sense. In three rounds, they have added a quality corner to a secondary whose incumbent starters are either on  the wane (Florence), injury-prone (McGee), or deeply inconsistent (McKelvin). After already greatly improving their pass rush through free agency, this is huge. They have also improved an offensive line (which was already trending upward in the last two years) by adding Cordy Glenn at tackle. And then they added a badly needed speed component to their receiving corps and kick return game. The Bills have, on paper at least, made some very nice improvements and they have addressed three of the four major needs everyone said they had going into this draft. (The fourth is the weak linebacking corps, which I believe they would have addressed had not the #$&%^!!! Panthers taken Kuechly the pick before the Bills.)<br /><br />I always assumed that Belichick was forever trading down, and ensuring two first round picks in the next draft every year, so that he'd be able to package both those picks and move up to eventually draft St. Tom the Overrated's successor at QB. But now, I think he figures that there's only two or three years left in St. Tom's tank, so he's gearing up for the last couple of runs this team has left in it. (St. Tom is 34, has started for 11 years, and has more than 20 postseason games, which is more than a whole extra season tacked onto his body.) That's my take, anyway.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"5 years ago","ctime":"April 28 2012, 15:01:22 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"The Bills did nothing?","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/Jaquandor","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Jaquandor","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_1183977","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=48907069&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Jaquandor","ctime_ts":1335625282,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15907913#t15907913","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15907913#t15907913","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15907913#t15907913","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"brettadill","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://brettadill.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":15907913,"talkid":62140,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/278089.html?thread=15907913#t15907913","upictitle":"brettadill: pic#0","article":"Sorry to hear tha....
