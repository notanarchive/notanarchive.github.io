My calendar will not just be headshots. In fact, one of the scenes in your wish list is amongst the 12. :)<br /><br />Remember that, excluding the cover, the sneak peeks you've seen are extreme crops of details within a larger piece of artwork. So if you think that the Arya, Hound, Bran and Melisandre sneak peeks are ALL of the picture, don't worry -- they're not. 'Figured that it was better to show faces for the sneaks than show obscure details. <br /><br />For what it's worth, my favorite illustrators aren't the ones that try to illustrate the scenes I read, but create visions or evoke emotions that amplify what I imagine on my own. For instance, one of the things I really love about N.C. Wyeth's classic paintings for Robin Hood or Treasure Island is that he would paint the beat before a moment, or the beat after it, but not necessarily the beat that the writer wrote. The picture became a part of the storytelling rather than being redundant of the writer's craft. I've always loved that. You'll see some of that in the calendar.<br /><br />At any rate, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts when it releases.
