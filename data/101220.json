I imagine that some places and some characters are very difficult to write, but each has their own logic.  Some of the places outside Westeros take a very different approach, which is why, in stories cast in the Middle Ages, the more \"civilized\" places overseas can be daunting.  For example, just now Elizabeth Moon is writing sequels to her Paksenarrion series, about the old civilization over the seas; she wrote the first books starting in 1988, and did not develop the overseas plot then.  Older civilizations need entire sets of laws and customs, and these can run counter to everything else, but somehow must be incorporated.  So, I am content to wait for your series to go into production to learn names of actors, etc.  I'm just glad it's happening, and best wishes for your writing as well.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"August 21 2009, 05:12:00 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"series and books","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://miss-ion.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"miss_ion","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"miss_ion","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://miss-ion.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"miss_ion","ctime_ts":1250831520,"tracked":0}]}
