{"itemid":34,"subject":"Wild Cards Returns!","event":"The new Wild Cards book is rapidly nearing completion, and I hope to be able to deliver it to Tor by the end of the year.  I'm just waiting on a few rewrites at present.\r\n\r\nThis will be the eighteenth volume in the overall series, and the first of our \"new generation\" triad.  The title will be INSIDE STRAIGHT.  Look for it in hardcover some time next year.\r\n\r\nFor those who can't wait, I have just uploaded a short sample to my website. Just click on the blue and white shield at the top of the main page.  The excerpt is by Daniel Abraham, and introduces his new ace, Jonathan Hive.  Have fun reading it.  I know I did.\r\n\r\nAnd for those of you who know me only for A SONG OF ICE & FIRE and have never read a WILD CARDS book... well, maybe it's time you did.  The two series are very different, of course, but then, I like to write (and edit) different sorts of things.  Variety's a great spice, in life, and love, and reading.\r\n\r\n(And yes, I may change the ICE & FIRE sample soon as well, but it will probably be one you've seen before, not something brand new.  When A FEAST FOR CROWS came out, I realized that something close to half the book had already been out there in one form or another -- website samples, readings, promotional giveaways, excerpts in magazines, and so on.  That was too much.  I am not going to do that with DANCE).","ditemid":8827,"eventtime":"2006-12-11 17:50:00","props":{"taglist":"tor, wild cards","commentalter":1168317977,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2006-12-12 01:50:30","anum":123,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html","event_timestamp":1165859400,"reply_count":109,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/40167126/9223371","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?replyto=1010555","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1010555#t1010555","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1010555#t1010555","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1010555#t1010555","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"khorboth","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://khorboth.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1010555,"talkid":3947,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1010555#t1010555","upictitle":"Khorboth: black","article":"I just want to second the comment about reading WILD CARDS.

I am really tired of listening to people bitch about not getting the book they seem to think they are the only person in the world waiting for - be it George's latest or the latest copy of the bible. Show me a great book that was written by someone who spent all their time sequestered in a cave and I will show you a fluke. Great ideas don't grow in the dark like fungus growing on shit. It is right and natural for a human being to have more than one interest.  Try it.<br /><br />I don't mean to come across so harshly, but seriously people (who are being so (fill in the blank) its not all about you.<br /><br />I'd also like to say that I thought my enjoyment of AFFC was lessened by reading/listening to too many spoiler chapters.  When I read one of the chapters I had read before, I found myself skipping ahead or skimming a bit. It was even worse for the chapters that had been changed - I got really confused and spent more time trying to figure out what changed than what was going on and it really lessened my enjoyment and understanding of the story. I won't be reading anything new that is released for ADwD should anything else come out, no matter how tempted I am.<br /><br />God, I am going to shut up now. :p","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"10 years ago","ctime":"December 12 2006, 15:48:36 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://thebadlady.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"thebadlady","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"thebadlady","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://thebadlady.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"thebadlady","ctime_ts":1165938516,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?replyto=1037435","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1037435#t1037435","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1037435#t1037435","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1037435#t1037435","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":1037435,"talkid":4052,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/8827.html?thread=1037435#t1037435","above":1022331,"article":"dont be such a whiner.
