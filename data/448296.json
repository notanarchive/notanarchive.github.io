{"itemid":1751,"subject":"The Last Kingdom","event":"Regular readers of this Not A Blog will know that I am a big fan of historical fiction, especially medieval historical fiction.  Nigel Tranter, Maurice Druon, Thomas B. Costain, Sharon Kay Penman, Cecelia Holland... and especiall Bernard Cornwell, who writes the best battles of any writer who has ever lived.\r\n\r\nCornwell is best known for his Sharpe series, mainly because that's the one that was made into a TV series (starring a young Sean Bean,<i><b> who did not die</b></i>).  But now he's got a second show coming: THE LAST KINGDOM, based on his novels about Uhtred of Northumbria.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"612\"/>\r\n\r\nThe opening title sequence is pretty cool too... graphics like GAME OF THRONES meets 300 meets BONANZA.\r\n\r\n<lj-embed id=\"613\"/>\r\n\r\nI can't wait!  If the BBC did justice to Cornwell's books, this show should kick ass.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM, A FEW DAYS LATER:  Saw the first episode, and thought it was terrific.  Very faithful to Cornwell's book.","ditemid":448296,"eventtime":"2015-10-10 16:27:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"historical fiction, television","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1444946512,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"The Last Kingdom http://goo.gl/nMAAPb","picture_keyword":"thumbs up","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"nterms:no","revnum":2,"interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.59917667467948]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1444606062}","revtime":1445019841},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-10-10 22:26:22","anum":40,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html","event_timestamp":1444494420,"reply_count":60,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125475067/76898605","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22833704#t22833704","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22833704#t22833704","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22833704#t22833704","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22833704#t22833704","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3333503","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/ViggoTheImpaler","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22833704,"talkid":89194,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22833704#t22833704","upictitle":"Azor Ahai: pic#125475067","article":"Really looking forward to this show too :)!

Budget is the general excuse but even in big budget movies like Braveheart the battles are quite badly done.<br /><br />Olivia's Henry V, shot in 44 with a limited budget, at least got costuming (mostly) and the opening stages of Agincourt correct.<br /><br />Shield wall seem to be the new fad but they are overdone as \"tortise\" formations (only used by Romans) and yes both sides would have used them.  It is an improvement over the standard Hollywood random charge forward (which would only serve to disrupt critical close order formations and exhaust the troops) but these remain all too common.<br /><br />Even mounted charges were delivered slowly and in close order until the last 20-30 yards (and sometimes in wedge).<br /><br />The lines and formations of real medieval battles could make for some interesting visuals and the desperate need to keep lines from cracking some dramatic moments.  Yet we continue to get disordered masses hacking away in random confusion and because for some reason costumers do not use hearldery, badges or retinue colors (even when, as in Ice and Fire, they are very much a part of the material) its impossible to tell one side from the other.  Likewise the effect of missiles storms (see Henry V for a great film version) so much a part of medieval warfare are generally ignored.<br /><br />Most productions hire technical advisors but then ignore them.  Eventually we will get a Saving Private Ryan for medieval battles (yes I know Save had its flaws) and perhaps at last force Hollywood to raise its game from silly (current) to at least an approximation (ala Saving).<br /><br />Did enjoy Last Kingdom.

The plot is engaging, characters interesting, and it has some great moments of humor, too.<br /><br />I have not read this series, and so I am experiencing the issue that many casual show-only Game of Thrones fans faced in that it's hard to keep track of everyone, and I have no idea how to spell many of their names! I have a bit more sympathy for watchers, now. That said...I doubt I'll be able to refrain from reading the books once this first season is over!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"October 11 2015, 22:39:27 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://twitter.com/MeereeneseKnot","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/twitter-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"MeereeneseKnot","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2927067","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=73605194&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"MeereeneseKnot","ctime_ts":1444603167,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22850344#t22850344","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22850344#t22850344","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22850344#t22850344","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22850344#t22850344","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22850344,"talkid":89259,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/448296.html?thread=22850344#t22850344","above":22849576,"upictitle":"George R.R.
