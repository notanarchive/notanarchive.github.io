{"itemid":690,"subject":"G-Men Rule","event":"Life is magical and full of joy!\r\n\r\nThe Gints opened their 2010 season by kicking some Panther ass, and I got up at three in the morning (Aussie time) to watch it all on Parris's latop, courtesy of DirecTV and NFL Season Ticket.\r\n\r\n(I will NOT be be able to do the same with tonight's Jets game, so no talk about that here).\r\n\r\nNot a perfect or dominating performance by any means but a convincing victory all the same.  The G-Men looked especially good in the second half when their running game finally started to generate some yards.  The defense bent a lot in the first half, allowing Carolina to drive deep, but never broke, holding the Panthers to field goals instead of touchdowns.  In the second half the D really started to look good.\r\n\r\nSill, a lot of areas to work on.  The special teams looked awful.  This new punter is no Jeff Feagles, and unless he improves, that could be a real problem.   And the WRs dropped way too many balls, letting them bounce off their hands to Panther defenders.  None of the Giant INTs were actaully Eli's fault... unlike the Panther INTs, which were all due to bad decisions by their QB.\r\n\r\nBut hey, it's  win.  I'll take it.\r\n\r\nThe first of many Big Blue victories at the new stadium, I hope.\r\n\r\nAnd I had a great signing at Galaxy in Sydney as well.","ditemid":176711,"eventtime":"2010-09-13 16:07:00","props":{"taglist":"nfl","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1284834979,"personifi_word_count":243,"picture_keyword":"G-men","opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"18:12,35:12,45:6,10:6,31:6,57:6,37:6,42:6,3:18,25:12,20:18,9:12,22:12,13:25","interface":"web","revnum":1,"revtime":1284358035},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-09-13 06:06:43","anum":71,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html","event_timestamp":1284394020,"reply_count":30,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/68080407/3266187","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?replyto=11034951","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11034951#t11034951","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11034951#t11034951","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11034951#t11034951","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"smofbabe","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11034951,"talkid":43105,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11034951#t11034951","upictitle":"Smofbabe: xdolphins","article":"<i>(I will NOT be be able to do the same with tonight's Jets game, so no talk about that here).</i><br /><br />If that's because of access and not timing, try ustream.tv<br /><br />(I'm pretty happy, myself: nice to start the season with an away win over Buffalo plus we  limited them to only 166 yards!)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"September 13 2010, 06:40:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"smofbabe","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"smofbabe","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://smofbabe.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"smofbabe","ctime_ts":1284360003,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/72544305/14697046","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?replyto=11035207","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11035207#t11035207","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11035207#t11035207","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11035207#t11035207","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11035207#t11035207","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"jemocasa","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://jemocasa.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":11035207,"talkid":43106,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/176711.html?thread=11035207#t11035207","upictitle":"jemocasa: pic#72544305","article":"I'm glad you were able to watch the game.

Calvin Johnson made that catch, and any with a good eye and a lick of common sense could see that (including the official, who immediately raised his hands to signal touchdown).  I don't fault the Chicago fans/players for accepting the win, of course; they aren't the ones who word the rules in such a pathetic fashion, so as to include the \"process\" of the catch, which essentially makes an incomplete pass out of one that was so obviously completed with control.
