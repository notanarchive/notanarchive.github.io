{"itemid":2028,"subject":"Hugo Thoughts: Best Professional Artist","event":"Hugo nominations are now open.  You will have until mid March to make your nominations... however, if you were not a member of MidAmericon II, you have <i><b>only today and tomorrow left</b></i> to sign up for either That Finnish Convention (this year's worldcon) and/or ConJose II (next year's worldcon) to earn the right to nominate.  Act now, or forever hold your peace.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I posted a few recommendations for the two Dramatic Presentation categories.  Today I'd like to offer a couple of artists for your consideration, staggering talents who did some outstanding work in 2016, and are more than worthy of nomination.  \r\n\r\nThe first of them is MICHAEL KOMARCK, who has been painting our Wild Cards covers ever since Tor revived the series.  He's done a bunch of other things too... check out his website... and he is doing the artwork for a Wild Cards graphic novel that is just going to blow your mind, but it's his recent Wild Cards covers that make me want to get up and dance.  Here's some of his recent work.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/413599/413599_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/413599/413599_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/413889/413889_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/413889/413889_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/415647/415647_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/415647/415647_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a>\r\n\r\nKomarck has been nominated for the Hugo once before, but has never won.  Here's some of his older Wild Cards covers.  Amazing work.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/414598/414598_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/414598/414598_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/414750/414750_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/414750/414750_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/415823/415823_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/415823/415823_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a>\r\n\r\nI had the honor to work with another wonderfully talented artist this year as well: the French artist DIDER GRAFFET, who illustrated the 2017 Ice & Fire calendar from Random House.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/414989/414989_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/414989/414989_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/415345/415345_original.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/415345/415345_900.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></a>  \r\n\r\nThere's lots more art in the calendar just as good.  Grab and copy and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nOf course, SF and fantasy are blessed with all sorts of extraordinary artists, many of whom have been Hugo winners or nominees in years past.  John Picacio, Julie Dillon, Donato Giancola, Stephan Martiniere, and many more are worthy of your consideration as well.  But any list of recommendations that does not include Komarck and Graffet is woefully incomplete, imnsho.","ditemid":519228,"eventtime":"2017-01-30 13:23:00","props":{"current_mood":"determined","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, artwork, worldcon, awards, art collecting","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Jan 30 20:23:20 2017]R [Mon Jan 30 20:23:21 2017]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/826163915587457024 ","current_moodid":45,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1485920699,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/826163915587457024","picture_keyword":"lohengrin","opt_screening":"F","likes_first_notify":1,"revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.604097906415191],[\"fra\",0.100169490476193]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1485807819}","og_image":"http://l-files.livejournal.net/og_image/7059164/2028?v=1486251972","revtime":1486251969},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2017-01-30 20:23:20","anum":60,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html","event_timestamp":1485782580,"reply_count":17,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126925994/79919867","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25686588#t25686588","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25686588#t25686588","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25686588#t25686588","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"danihinze","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://danihinze.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25686588,"talkid":100338,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25686588#t25686588","article":"So excited to see something related to Game of thrones, I'm getting that calendar now :) <br />I love your posts, keep them coming, Hopefully there can be some new's on the game of thrones book :) <br />Coming soon, going to be a awesome year.

Like, huge sections seemed to be consumed by massive, angry capslocked George R.R. Martins. Turns out, you're just also a prolific editor. It also turns out, however, that the Wild Cards series is really, really good, and really, really underrated. <br /><br />Anyways, small question about your editing process. Basically, I've heard through the grapevine that the writer GRRM is slightly miffed by editors, so does the editor GRRM take a more laissez-faire approach? Also, if the editor GRRM edited the writer GRRM's novel, would the writer GRRM be annoyed with the editor GRRM?  <br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 months ago","ctime":"January 31 2017, 01:31:45 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/diydepression","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Kyle Gideon","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2751600","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=72144472&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Kyle Gideon","ctime_ts":1485826305,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25689660#t25689660","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25689660#t25689660","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25689660#t25689660","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":25689660,"talkid":100350,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/519228.html?thread=25689660#t25689660","above":25689404,"upictitle":"George R.R.
