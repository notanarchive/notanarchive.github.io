{"itemid":1883,"subject":"Countdown to Hugo","event":"We're one week away from the announcement of the 2016 Hugo nominations.  Drum roll, please.\r\n\r\nShould be interesting.  MidAmericon II has announced that more than 4000 nominating ballots were received, shattering the previous record of 2122 set by Sasquan last year.  The nominating pool included all those who were members of Sasquan and of next year's worldcon in Finland as well as the members of MidAmericon itself.  \r\n\r\nHowever, to actually vote on the awards, you will need to be a member of Big Mac II.  You can take care of that here:  http://www.midamericon2.org/   \r\n\r\nI am hopeful that my own exhortations encouraged a few people to nominate who might elsewise have forgotten.  And of course I am hopeful that a few of my own favorites, the books and stories and television shows and movies that I recommended here, will make the shortlist.  But there's no way of knowing until the nominations are announced.   \r\n\r\nWhether my own choices make the cut or not, I will be pleased if we get an honest ballot this year, with Hugo-worthy choices in all categories.","ditemid":482065,"eventtime":"2016-04-18 12:59:00","props":{"current_mood":"anxious","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, fandom","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon Apr 18 18:59:17 2016]R [Mon Apr 18 18:59:18 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/722137446956158976 ","current_moodid":4,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1461258849,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/722137446956158976","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.66548904988292]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1461006002}","revtime":1461539909},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-04-18 18:59:13","anum":17,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/482065.html","event_timestamp":1460984340,"reply_count":29,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126068595/77782230","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/482065.html?thread=24240657#t24240657","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/482065.html?thread=24240657#t24240657","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/482065.html?thread=24240657#t24240657","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3610962","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://twitter.com/Jose_Palos","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24240657,"talkid":94690,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/482065.html?thread=24240657#t24240657","upictitle":"Jose C.Rojas: pic#126068595","article":"Hi George, you plan to come soon to Spain?

controversy last year that they were creating a slate because what the majority of people consider Real Science Fiction(tm) was not being reflected in the Hugo nomination and award process because \"SJWs\" in some unproved Machiavellian way controlled that process, and that their list was not really a slate but a list based on an open contribution process that reflected what the wider fan community truly considered to be Real Science Fiction.<br /><br />Therefore, it's legitimate to point out that their repeated claims to this effect are negated by their more open list this year, which presumably was not sullied by SJW machinations but which does not look anything like last year's supposedly representative slate.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1

Since it seems likely that the Puppies (both kinds) are a minority, it will be impossible for them to flood the ballot. Two, the SP's have not put forward a slate, but rather a recommended list which, crucially, is longer than the number of finalists in most categories. This reduces the likelihood that a large number of nominators will produce identical ballots. It can still happen, of course, if Sad Puppy supporters choose to regard the top five positions as their slate - but some, perhaps many, won't do that, preferring to mix up their nominations with selections lower down in the lists. Three, the Sads and even the Rabids have put forth at least some recommendations that are (in all likelihood) acceptable to non-Puppies. This gives us an excellent chance of avoiding the no award situation this year.<br /><br />So it seems to me that we're probably on the way to a kinder, gentler, more inclusive and altogether less heated Hugo process this year.

For short stories, it goes as the square root of total participation (or very close to it). If the slates really did get 500 disciplined voters, then we needed over 10,000 \"organic votes\" just to keep them from sweeping. (That is, just to have a single non-slate candidate in the Best Short Story list.) Obviously we fell far short of that.<br /><br />But several things might mitigate this:<br /><br />1) The RP folks were very late with their slates and they updated them near the last minute. That may have impacted their participation numbers quite a bit. Also, they did not achieve perfect slate discipline last year, so they may not manage it this year either.<br /><br />2) The RP slates do contain a few Hugo-worthy works this time. (I read and reviewed them all--they are not ALL trash this time.) Some are mainstream works that might have been nominated anyway, but some are exactly the sort of excellent, overlooked works that the puppies have always claimed to champion. Even if the slates do sweep, fans will not be forced to choose between No Award and trash.<br /><br />3) The existence of recommendation lists (including Rocket Stack Rank) may have had the effect of concentrating the fan vote on fewer choices. That would change the exponent in the distribution and make it easier for organic voters to prevent a sweep.<br /><br />As I said above, it's impossible to predict at this point. We'll know in six days.<br /><br />If it does come down to another sweep, it will be more important than ever to urge voters to rank Hugo-worthy works above No Award, even if they came from the RP slate. Last year, it was easy for people to vote the slated works under No Award because they genuinely didn't meet the bar. That won't be the case this year. I know you're on the side of the angels when it comes to voting based on the quality of the work; just expect to fight a different kind of Hell if there's another sweep this year. :-)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"April 21 2016, 16:58:29 UTC","parent":24249105,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: Countdown to Hugo","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://plus.google.com/104047528081360678099","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/google-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Gregory Hullender","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3235758","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76533502&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Gregory Hullender","ctime_ts":1461257909,"tracked":0}]}
