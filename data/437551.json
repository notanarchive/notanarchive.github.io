{"itemid":1709,"subject":"Worldcon: Winning and Losing","event":"Drumroll, please.  The end is nigh.  The climax approaches.  Come Tuesday, I will be flying off to Spokane for Sasquan, Bigfoot's favorite worldcon.  A week from Saturday, this year's Hugo Awards will be handed out, and we can put an end to the Puppy Wars... the 2015 edition, at least.  There will be winners, there will be losers.  Some will celebrate, some will weep.  The vote totals will be parsed to a fare-the-well, no doubt, and spin doctors will be out in force.\r\n\r\nThe Puppies are already spinning, in fact.  If you visit the Puppy blogs, you'll soon see that both the Sads and Rabids are busy constructing a nifty little narrative so they can claim victory no matter what happens.  If nominees from the Puppy slates take home rockets, they won!  If No Award prevails across the board, they won by destroying the Hugos.  If non-slate finalists prevail, they won by \"proving\" something or other (since they keep changing their complaint, pretty much any result is guaranteed to prove something, if squinted at the right way).\r\n\r\nAll that is nonsense, of course.  Like most Puppy claims have been from the start of this fiasco.  Hypocrisy and delusion.  Me and my friend Occam, we use a simpler razor.  If the Puppies win, they win.  If they lose, they lose.  And No Award... well, that does make this a three-body problem rather than a simple binary one, but I will get to that later.  So if the Hugo voters do indeed vote down the bulk of Puppy nominees, please stand up with me and blow a big loud raspberry at any Puppy who tries to claim that black is white, up is down, and losing is winning.  It ain't.\r\n\r\n<i><b>WILL</b></i> the Puppies lose?\r\n\r\nI don't know.  No one knows.  Don't believe any fool who tries to tell you otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe do know that 5950 Hugo ballots were cast this year, smashing all previous records.  You can find the details here:  http://www.thehugoawards.org/2015/08/2015-hugo-voting-participation-smashes-records/  Last year, in contrast, only 3587 valid ballots were received, though Loncon was the largest worldcon in history.  There's no doubt that the Puppygate controversy that has inflamed the internet since the nominations were announced drove those numbers.  Supporting Membership rocketed up to unprecedented levels.  \r\n\r\nBut who are all these new members?  Over at FILE 770, the feeling seems to be that most of them are fans rallying to the defense of the Hugos.  If so, the Puppy finalists will not only lose, they could very well be crushed, with lots of them finishing behind No Award.  But some of the Puppies seem equally convinced that the new members are Puppy supporters, joining up in droves to stick it to those vile [fill in Brad Torgersen's offensive epithet of the week].  If that's true, the Puppies could actually win some rockets.  Hell, if this betokens a mass migration of Gamergaters, the Rabids might even sweep the awards.\r\n\r\nWhich narrative is true?  Which is deluded?  No one knows, and no one is going to know until David Gerrold and Tanarive Due start to rip open those envelopes a week from Saturday.\r\n\r\nFor those on the edge of their seat wondering how this will all turn out, here's a hint: watch the Campbell Award.  \r\n\r\nJust as there are \"swing states\" and \"swing counties\" and \"swing precincts\" that act as predictors of the results of an election, this year's voting for the John W. Campbell Award (Not A Hugo) for Best New Writer will give us a strong indication of who is likely to prevail in all the races to follow.\r\n\r\nthe first Campbell winner\r\n<img src=\"http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/grrm/7059164/266012/266012_600.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\nThe Campbell Award is traditionally the first major writing award of the evening, given before any of the actual Hugo Awards.  It is usually preceded by the First Fandom Award and the Big Heart Award, and sometimes by the Seiuns, the \"Japanese Hugo.\"  Some worldcons prefer to give the Seiuns at another time; I have no idea where Sasquan will come down on that.  Most of the Puppies do not even know what First Fandom is, and I know damn well that none of them are going to win a Big Heart Award, now or ever, so we can be reasonably certain that those two awards will go as usual.  Bringing us to the Campbell.\r\n\r\nThis year's Best New Writer finalists include Wesley Chu and four Puppies.  Jason Cordova, Kary English, and Eric S. Raymond were on both slates, Sad Puppies and Rabid.  Rolf Nelson, the fourth Puppy, was on the Rabid slate, but not the Sad.\r\n\r\nIn any normal year, Wesley Chu would have to be considered the overwhelming favorite to win the tiara.  The Campbell has a two-year window of eligibility, and this is Chu's second and final year.  He was a nominee last year as well, with the third-highest number of nominations, behind only the ultimate winner and a second-place finisher, neither of them eligible this year, so we know that a lot of fans already like his work.  His body of work has only gotten stronger in the intervening year.  And, honestly, bottom line, Chu is the best writer of this year's five... and that IS what the Campbell is supposed to reward after all, the Best New Writer.\r\n\r\nBut will he win?  Well, that's in the hand of those 5950 voters.\r\n\r\nIf Wesley Chu takes the Campbell, as he should, I think we will be in for a fairly reasonable night in Spokane.  There will be some winners from the slates, and some categories will go the No Award, but most of the rockets will actually go to deserving work.  If Chu wins, I think the vast majority of the fans in the auditorium will be more happy than not by night's end.\r\n\r\nIf No Award wins, however... if No Award takes the Campbell, it will represent a huge and ominous victory for the \"nuclear option,\" for the faction of fandom that wants to destroy the village in order to save it.  A victory by No Award in this category will signify that the voters decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and will likely betoken a long ugly night ahead, with category after category going to No Award.  Myself, I think this unlikely.  I think the hardcore \"vote No Award on everything\" voters are a small (if noisy) minority.  But I could be wrong.  It could happen.  \r\n\r\nAnd what if one of the four Puppy finalists takes the tiara?\r\n\r\nThat would represent a victory for the Puppies, certainly.  But even there, certain distinctions should be made.  Rolf Nelson was a candidate of the Rabids, but not the Sads.  A victory by Nelson would be a singular triumph for Teddy Beale and the most extreme elements of Puppydom... and could suggest even worse results ahead, up to and including VD actually winning one or both of the Editing Hugos for which he is nominated. \r\n\r\nKary English, on the other hand, represents a much more moderate side of Puppydom.  Though initially put forward by both the Sad and Rabid slates, VD later dropped her and removed her from his suggested ballot entirely when English put up a couple of blog posts that distanced herself from the Puppy party line.  English is also a Hugo nominee this year, for her story \"Totalled.\"  She's the strongest writer of the four Puppy finalists, and in any normal year would be Wesley Chu's toughest competition.  This year?  She could well finish last, since some trufans will not forgive her for being part of the slates to begin with, and the Rabids will not forgive her for breaking ranks.  Myself, I think English deserves better.  While I don't think she is as good as Chu at present, she is plainly a talented new writer, and not unworthy of a Campbell nod.  I would prefer a Chu victory in this category... but I'd rather see English take the tiara than No Award.\r\n\r\nOh, and while we are crunching candidates here, Eric S. Raymond warrants a few words.  A candidate of both the Sad and Rabid slates, Raymond was nominated as one of the field's best new writers on the basis of a <i>single published story</i>, the thinnest resume in the entire history of the Campbell Award.  Maybe if that story was the greatest short ever published in our genre, that would be warranted... but it's not.  Even Raymond himself expressed incredulity at his nomination.  Given how little SF he has produced compared to Chu and the other finalists, one might think that Raymond would be the longest of long shots.  Ah, but there's another factor.  However much a neophyte he may be as a writer of science fiction, Eric S. Raymond is a well-known figure is the gaming world.  Should Raymond win the Campbell, despite his shaky credentials as a writer of fiction, it would suggest strongly that large numbers of gamers had purchased supporting membership to vote for him.   (Whether those gamers were Gamergaters is another question entirely, and one that cannot be proved.  So far as I know, Raymond has not been a part of the Gamergate controversy).\r\n\r\nI have no idea who is going to win.\r\n\r\nBut once we know the winner, it will tell us a lot about how the rest of the night will go.\r\n\r\nWatch the Campbell.\r\n\r\n(Some thoughts on the other Hugo categories to follow, if I find the time)","ditemid":437551,"eventtime":"2015-08-14 17:08:00","props":{"current_mood":"thoughtful","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, puppygate","current_moodid":30,"commentalter":1440168694,"crosspost_tw":"Worldcon: Winning and Losing http://goo.gl/vJF06F","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","revnum":1,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","hasscreened":1,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"opt_lockcomments":1,"picture_keyword":"torcon","opt_screening":"F","spam_counter":5,"langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.698477951309103]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1439593700}","revtime":1441049520},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2015-08-14 23:08:09","anum":47,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html","event_timestamp":1439572080,"reply_count":77,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125255917/76571958","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22281263#t22281263","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22281263#t22281263","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22281263#t22281263","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22281263#t22281263","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3241842","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/861992560559632/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22281263,"talkid":87036,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22281263#t22281263","upictitle":"Joel Duncan: pic#125255917","article":"Its pretty crazy that I read every single one of your posts.

For the Campbell, even though Nelson was a Rabid nominee, he's at the bottom of Vox's ballot. ESR tops it, then Chu.<br /><br />On the subject of whether or not No Award is a Puppy victory -- this is the fundamental difference between the Sad and Rabid factions. Torgersen believes in the Hugo Awards, and the nomination process, and participated in good faith. No Award is a failure for the Sad Puppies.<br /><br />Vox Day on the other hand is on record before the nominations came out, discussing how his initial plan was to use a bloc vote to cast a ballot for 'No Award' in all categories. Torgersen and Correia talked him out of it, and into participating in good faith, this year at least, but he's nevertheless voted No Award in the Best Graphic Story category. The Rabid Puppies want to conquer the village or raze it to the ground.

While I agree that it's Chu's year, and his body of work is amazing given the short time he's produced it, Jason is a good guy that's been working the farm leagues for a long time before finally being called up to the bigs, and there's no hate in his heart for anyone.

I think that the slate bombing was perhaps desperation on their part. Like GRRM said in an earlier post, they aren't the first and probably won't be the last to do that. Nevertheless, I was scratching my head when the Puppies like Brad Torgersen (or whoever, I really haven't been following this particular controversy for reasons that I'll get into later, so I truly do not know the truth of that statement that I just made) started calling for a boycott of Tor. It seemed straight up hypocritical. They \"organized\" (for lack of a better term) the Puppy movement because they thought there stuff wasn't getting read or seen. Now they want to turn it around and be the ones dominating? <br /><br />Personally, I just want all this crap over. Puppies, Truefans, PuppyKickers, Rabid Puppies, SJWs, CHORFs (whatever the hell those are...), Sad Puppies, I don't care, I've had it. I really only learned about the whole damn thing when I saw an article about it on a news site which shall not be named, and I got an overdose of it reading GRRM's blog. I came to GRRM's blog for the rare snippets of happenings in regards to The Winds of Winter because I'd be a lying sack of something if I said A Song of Ice and Fire didn't inspire me to write the story that I'm trying to write. And yet, the complete opposite has happened. The whole damn thing has made it damn near impossible for me to write. This whole thing is enough to drive me out of my dream and hobby. I think of literature (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Sci-Fi Fantasy, I don't care) like gaming: when I sit down to a game, I don't care what the political beliefs and leanings of my guild mates are. When I sit down and read a book, I really don't give a crap what the political leanings of the author, editor and publishing house are. And yet this whole thing is making me think that people are now looking at a piece of literature through political glasses. I have my political beliefs and leanings and they are what they are. Perhaps they surface more than a little in my writing, I don't know.<br /><br />But all I do know is this: what's the point of writing and trying to become a published author when no one's going to care because of your political beliefs? Are people going to even consider a book because the author happens to like Rush Limbaugh? Or the author voted for Barack Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections?<br /><br />Can't we just agree that the books are the books and leave the politics to the politicians and media? I'll be honest, I don't think so. And I don't think the Hugos are going to fix anything. Someone is going to get pissed on where the Rocket flew to and they're going start slinging insults and obscenities and the whole thing is only going to get worse. It doesn't matter which side it comes from: Puppy or Non-Puppy. There are radical fringe morons in every group you can think of and they're not satisfied if they aren't pissing on someone or something so they're going to start pissing and this whole thing will start up again next year as old banners are unfurled.<br /><br />I want to believe that GRRM and Brad Torgersen could sit down at a bar, have a beer and discuss the impending Football season and the merits of X book by Y person, but I don't think it could happen. And it doesn't necessarily have to come from anything they say either.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"1 year ago","ctime":"August 16 2015, 02:58:02 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Puppies, Truefans and Writing","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tjcotter.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tjcotter","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tjcotter","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tjcotter.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"etime":"August 16 2015, 03:24:12 UTC","dname":"tjcotter","ctime_ts":1439693882,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/49978201/702443","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22300463#t22300463","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22300463#t22300463","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22300463#t22300463","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"bruceb","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://bruceb.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":22300463,"talkid":87111,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/437551.html?thread=22300463#t22300463","above":22296623,"upictitle":"Bruce Baugh: dresser Montano 2006","article":"The trick is apparently to write well.

But obviously, they're not talking.<br /><br />2. I was nominated for the Campbell based on two stories, although I lost the first year. I won the second year, but only had had one more story published by the time of the voting. So maybe not as thin a resume as Raymond's, but thin.<br /><br />-- Michael A.
