{"itemid":6,"subject":"Aaaarrrgh!","event":"Finally got caught up on all the football games that Parris TIVO'd for me during my book tour.  Yesterday I got to watch the Jets and Giants play live for the first time in six weeks.  \r\n\r\nArgh.  You'd think with two teams, I'd at least have one kicker who could make a goddamned field goal.  The Giants gave me three heart attacks, and the Jets added a fourth...\r\n\r\nI take some solace from telling myself that, aside from the three missed field goals and all those false starts, the Giants played damn well against a tough Seahawks squad and are still in the thick of things.\r\n\r\nAs for my poor Jets, well, they should get a high draft choice, at least.","ditemid":1744,"eventtime":"2005-11-28 18:07:00","props":{"commentalter":1292888658},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2005-11-29 01:04:33","anum":208,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1744.html","event_timestamp":1133201220,"reply_count":2,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1744.html?replyto=91088","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1744.html?thread=91088#t91088","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1744.html?thread=91088#t91088","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1744.html?thread=91088#t91088","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":91088,"talkid":355,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/1744.html?thread=91088#t91088","article":"If I have to watch football, George...
