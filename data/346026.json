It's actually only the third sunny day since Winter ended (yes I keep track). Perhaps Australia is sending a message for you to not kill off any more Starks or Snows related to the Starks!\n\n\nIf you are currently in Melbourne, have you considered taking a quick road trip to Ballarat (an hour and a bit away and my home town.) I am unsure if you have ever visited but our city is steeped in heritage and pre 1880s architecture. as well as being the site of the Eureka Rebellion. Sovereign Hill is a very amusing theme-park about the Gold Rush and panning for gold is always fun. The Ballarat Wildlife Park is always worth a visit as well.\n\nEnjoy the rest of you holiday and New Zealand.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"November 19 2013, 01:50:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Down Under","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/alex.deppeler","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Alex Deppeler","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2273898","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=67432944&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Alex Deppeler","ctime_ts":1384825851,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/104243906/16317310","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18434986#t18434986","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18434986#t18434986","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18434986#t18434986","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"stubbycarey","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://stubbycarey.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18434986,"talkid":72011,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18434986#t18434986","upictitle":"stubbycarey: targshirt","article":"Hope you've enjoyed the travelling around down here :)","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"November 19 2013, 04:40:14 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://stubbycarey.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"stubbycarey","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"stubbycarey","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://stubbycarey.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"stubbycarey","ctime_ts":1384836014,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/122206823/67374600","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18435242#t18435242","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18435242#t18435242","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18435242#t18435242","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"garrybaratheon","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://garrybaratheon.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18435242,"talkid":72012,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/346026.html?thread=18435242#t18435242","upictitle":"garrybaratheon: pic#122206823","article":"Thankyou very much for visiting George, your fans downunder really do appreciate it!
