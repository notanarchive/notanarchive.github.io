{"itemid":1905,"subject":"All the King's Horses...","event":"Last year at Sasquan the worldcon business meeting passed two proposals to change the voting procedures for the Hugo Awards, to deal with the problems posed by slating.  WSFS rules require that a change be passed by two successive worldcons before it takes effect, however, so both 4/6 and EPH will be up again for vote at MidAmericon II in August.\r\n\r\nThe 4/6 proposal is pretty straightforward.  At present there are five finalists in each category, and each voter gets to nominate five choices for those five slots.  4/6 would increase the number of finalists to six, and simultaneously decrease the number of nominations allowed each voter to four.  The theory being that a slate voting lockstep might take four slots, but not the whole category.\r\n\r\nEPH, which stands for E Pluribus Hugo, is considerably more complicated, and I will not attempt to describe it here.  It was designed by mathematicians and voting theorists, and will supposedly prevent a small disciplined minority from taking all the slots on the ballot.  There's been plenty of discussion and debate about EPH all over the internet.\r\n\r\nMost recently, the designers of EPH have done a test run to see what impact the system would have had on the latest ballot.  The results, and a spirited discussion of same, can be found over on Mike Glyer's FILE 770, here: http://file770.com/?p=28946#comments\r\n\r\n((For those of an academic and mathematical bent, the hard crunchy bits are here: https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/Proportional_Voting_System.pdf ))\r\n\r\nFrom where I sit, the EPH results are not very encouraging.\r\n\r\nOver the past few months, I've read countless variations of the statement that goes, \"well, this is the last year we will have a problem, come summer we'll pass EPH and all will be fine.\"  I had my doubts about that every time I heard it, and this new report just confirms them.  We may indeed pass EPH, and it may help... a little... but all will <i><b>not</b></i> be fine.  \r\n\r\nWe may pass 4/6 too, and that could also help... slightly... but it's easily thwarted, if you have hundreds of followers who will do exactly as you tell them, and the Rabids seem to have just that.  \r\n\r\nIf EPH and 4/6, or both, are passed at MidAmericon II, and work more-or-less as advertised, the slates will no longer be able to completely dominate entire categories by taking all five slots.  The reforms should ensure that there are at least one or two legitimate nominees in every category.  Which is better, certainly, than what has happened to Best Related Work the past two ballots, say.  But it is still far from ideal.  Future ballots will instead look more like last year's Best Novelette, Best Professional Artist, and Best Fan Writer shortlists, or this year's Best Fan Artist, all of which featured one legit choice and four slate candidates.  Maybe we'd see some improvement in some categories, and have two finalists to choose between.\r\n\r\nBetter than what we have now?  Sure.  But comparable to being able to choose among five strong candidates to decide which one was the very best of the year?  Not even close.\r\n\r\nI can hear the proponents of EPH and 4/6 saying their reforms were never meant to be a cure all.  Yes, I know that, I never believed otherwise, and I applaud your efforts to help.  I just wish these reforms helped <i><b>more</b></i>.  Neither EPH nor 4/6 is going to prevent us from having VD on the Best Editor shortlist from now until the heat death of the universe.   \r\n\r\nAnd I also know that there are now other proposals out there, proposals that call for three-stage voting, for negative votes and blackballing, for juries.  Some of these cures, I fear, might be even worse than the disease.  We have plenty of juried awards; we don't need another.  Three-stage voting, with fifteen semi-finalists that get boiled down to five finalists and one winner?  Maybe, but that considerably increases the workload of the Hugo administrators, whose job is hard enough already... and I fear it would actually ratchet up campaigning, as friends and fans of those on the List of Fifteen rallied around their favorites to get them on the List of Five. And a blackball round, voting things <i><b>off</b></i> the ballot?  Is that really a can of worms we want to open, in this present climate?  That would dial the ugliness up to eleven, I fear... or higher.  \r\n\r\nSadly, I don't think there is an answer here.  No magic bullet is going to fix this.  And I fear that the people saying, \"pretty soon the assholes will get bored and go away,\" are being hopelessly naive.  The assholes are having far too much fun.\r\n\r\nA year ago April, when Sasquan announced the ballot, I wrote the Hugo Awards had been broken, and might never be fixed.  A lot has happened since that time, and from time to time I've allowed myself to think that there was a light at the end of the tunnel, that this too would pass.  Now I am starting to fear that my first reaction was the correct one.  \r\n\r\nThe Hugo Awards have always been an occasion for joy, for celebrating excellence and recognizing the best among us.  That's what we need to get back to.  But I don't see how.","ditemid":487818,"eventtime":"2016-05-16 15:03:00","props":{"current_mood":"discontent","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"hugo awards, worldcon, awards","crosspost_tw_log":"[Mon May 16 21:03:19 2016]R [Mon May 16 21:03:20 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/732315521236901888 ","current_moodid":10,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1463957677,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/732315521236901888","ratingbot_comment":"noncyr","picture_keyword":"Hugo","opt_screening":"F","revnum":3,"personifi_tags":"nterms:no","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.657774980724702]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1463432645}","revtime":1464111237},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-05-16 21:03:11","anum":138,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html","event_timestamp":1463410980,"reply_count":194,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126036282/25501565","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480650#t24480650","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480650#t24480650","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480650#t24480650","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sohryu_l","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sohryu-l.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24480650,"talkid":95627,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480650#t24480650","article":"I've been following your Hugo-related posts for two years now and this is what I must say.<br /><br />The Russian/CIS SF scene has nothing on the Western one.","upictitle":"Люси Сорью: Маришка","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"12 months ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"May 16 2016, 21:19:19 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://sohryu-l.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"sohryu_l","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"sohryu_l","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://sohryu-l.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"sohryu_l","ctime_ts":"1463433559","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125210192/70950218","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480906#t24480906","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480906#t24480906","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480906#t24480906","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cashcraig","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cashcraig.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24480906,"talkid":95628,"etime_ts":"1463434329","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24480906#t24480906","upictitle":"Cash Craig: pic#125210192","article":"4/6 is good but it seem like any large and concentrated effort should be able to sweep 6 slots (or even more) with just a bit of planning and stepped-up recruitment.

Clearly I'm not unbiased, but I am an expert on voting systems.<br /><br />I don't agree with everything our illustrious host says, but pretty much all of it is at least reasonable. The one thing I do want to say is that I think that if you have a public \"longlist\" of 15 or whatever, then it is important to also have something like EPH or, preferably, EPH+ in place also. Having the former without the latter would allow slate voters too much power to censor certain kinds of works; to ensure that they don't become finalists unless they're runaway winners. I think that if that became the norm, it would do more damage than the occasional ludicrously-unsuited finalist (or than an explicit \"blackballing\" round, which, perhaps surprisingly, would be much harder for a slate to hijack, if it were well-designed.)<br /><br />So: I think EPH, EPH+, and a longlist are all potentially good ideas, but doing a longlist without at least one of EPH or EPH+ is a very bad idea.<br /><br />And by the way, thanks to our host for his reasonable discussion.

If you want to add rules that say, \"The Committee may decide to disqualify individual ballots or finalists for [defined reason],\" fine, I'll help you word it and place it before WSFS to try and give the Hugo Award Administrators that authority. Bear in mind that any technical definition you can make of \"slate voting\" is likely to be easy to game by anyone trying to evade it.<br /><br />Even in the year when a case of outright fraud appeared clear-cut (a set of identical ballots with membership paid by consecutively-numbered money orders mailed from the same place at the same time), the Committee didn't disqualify the votes. They did take the (extra-legal) step of adding the sixth-place finisher to the ballot. One of the original finalists then withdrew. (There's no evidence that the candidate that withdrew was involved with the questionable ballots.) That's actually the basis of the \"<a href=\"http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com/1562815.html\" target=\"_blank\">Plus 2</a>\" proposal I wrote up recently: Allow the Committee to add up to 2 additional finalists drawn from the Top 15.<br /><br />Hugo Award Administrators have <em>never</em> disqualified individual voters or finalists based on subjective perception of their motivations in casting their votes. I would be very leery of ever giving them this authority. The gun points both ways.<br /><br />The only qualification for being a member is being an individual natural person who has paid membership dues. Anyone who wants to start applying an ideological test actually confirms all of the worst accusations of the Griefers.<br /><br />It is of course rather ironic that while claiming that Secret Slaters have been manipulating the results for years (untrue), the Griefers set out to do exactly what they accused everyone else of doing, but that had never actually been happening. And now we have to adjust our system to deal with such bad actors.<br /><br />Remember that the Griefers <em>want</em> to destroy the Hugo Awards. Any solution that concludes \"shut them down\" gives them exactly what they want.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"12 months ago","below":24483722,"ctime":"May 16

I define it as \"200 organized voters can overwhelm 4,000 unorganized ones.\"  That appears to be both this year and last year's problem.  We don't appear to have a multiple slate problem, nor do we have a campaigning problem.<br /><br />So, if the problem is as defined above, what is a workable solution?  Here's where 4 and 6 works.  First, it dilutes by 33% any slate attempt.  You either need a third more voters or a willingness to settle for a third less.  Second, it complicates any attempt to lock up the whole thing.  A slate needs to divide its voters into three even blocs.  Third, it concentrates the other voters.  Some number (up to 20%) of works currently nominated won't be.  I have to suspect those will mostly be the forlorn hope works that wouldn't make it in anyway.  So, in short, 4 and 6 boosts the typical voter and waters down a slate.<br /><br />","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"12 months ago","ctime":"May 16 2016, 22:31:03 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://chris-gerrib.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"chris_gerrib","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"chris_gerrib","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://chris-gerrib.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"chris_gerrib","ctime_ts":"1463437863","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24483210#t24483210","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24483210#t24483210","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24483210#t24483210","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24483210#t24483210","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24483210,"talkid":95637,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24483210#t24483210","above":24482698,"upictitle":"George R.R.

We are slapping bandaids on a sucking chest wound.  <br /><br />Also, to quibble a bit, we do have a campaigning problem, and have ever since the advent of the internet.  Actually, it goes back further, but it has gotten worse since the internet.  I remember when my friend Lisa Tuttle refused a Nebula to protest against campaigning for that award.  Sadly, it had no impact.<br /><br />We don't have a multiple slate problem YET -- but I think that's just a matter of time, unless someone finds a real solution here.

Some change to the rules beyond EPH is going to be necessary, unfortunately. A few thoughtful math people predicted this, and now we know it's true.<br /><br />I have no idea what the answer is, but I know that the people who are trying to ruin these awards are having so much success that they will not stop, especially now that we know what minor impact EPH will actually have against a determined minority of slate voters, even if that change to the voting rules is approved in Kansas City.<br /><br />I find it very depressing that Beale has decided to game the Hugo nominating process. I wish he would find another hobby. But he's forcing so many people to react to him that I'm sure he's entirely gratified and energized. His campaign is working. <br /><br />Get used to at least two to three years of NO AWARDs in a bunch of categories, until someone comes up with a real fix against slating.

Martin: Spain","article":"Attracting more voters... actually, more nominators... is at least a partial answer, but only if they actually nominate.<br /><br />This year we had more than 4000 nominating ballots, almost twice as many as ever before.  Had all of them actually nominated in all the categories, the Rabids would not have been able to dominate as they did.  If we look at the numbers, the categories that got the heaviest turnout like Best Novel (3695 ballots) and Best Dramatic Long Form (2904 ballots) were able to get several legit finalists on the ballot.  Where did the Rabids sweep?  In Related Work (2080 ballots), in Pro Artist (1481), etc.  Somehow Steve Stiles managed to get through in Fan Artist, the lowest turnout at 1073... but elsewise there seems to be an inverse correlation between number of nominations and Rabid dominance.  There were 1600 voters who nominated for Best Novel but left Best Related Work blank... and that made all the difference.<br /><br />I am not saying \"get out the vote\" is a magic bullet, but it would certainly help.  In Hugo voting as in real world politics.  You canNOT just vote for Novel/ President.

Members of the following Worldcon were granted nominating rights in 2012. So the only \"relatively new\" element is the inclusion of the following year's members in the nominating electorate, and it seems unlikely that this was a significant issue either last year or this year.<br /><br />The actual membership dues are set by the current Worldcon. For example, a supporting membership this year is $50, not $40.<br /><br />Eliminating the rights of supporting members to participate in the affairs of WSFS is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as there are hundreds if not thousands of people who are regular participants in WSFS affairs who do not have the resources to attend every single Worldcon, but who want to continue to be

When you vote for a Hugo, you have a virtual ballot online, which you can visit over a long period of time, and change your votes if you like, until the deadline. What if, during the nominating process, it were possible to go online to see who is currently getting the most votes?<br />Part of the problem last year was that everyone was blindsided by the arrival of the slates; only after the ballots were announced, and it was too late to change them, was the problem revealed. If there were an ongoing tally, available online during the nomination period, then everyone would know who was winning the race for the ballot, and it might motivate more people to vote. An added wrinkle would be to create a second window at the end, where no new works/candidates are nominated, but voters can still shift their votes around - a runoff for the nominations. Runoff elections are arguably fairer because the voters have the chance to go to their second choices, to avoid a third outcome that they want to avoid; 'I really wanted Work A to win, but Work B is also great, and it's getting a lot of support, and at least we won't get Work C'. Consensus forms. Also, it would prevent the slates from dominating by dropping their votes at the last minute.<br />This could also be a way for lesser know authors to get some exposure.

So by the time the process is ending, most non-slate voters will have only one surviving nominee, and they'll be giving it a full 60 points (in your explanation).","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"12 months ago","ctime":"May 17 2016, 17:59:34 UTC","parent":24507018,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: EPH in the simplest possible terms","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://jamesonquinn.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"jamesonquinn","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"jamesonquinn","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://jamesonquinn.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"jamesonquinn","ctime_ts":"1463507974","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":1,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24511370#t24511370","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24511370#t24511370","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24511370#t24511370","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_2587046","loaded":0,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2246029","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24511370,"talkid":95747,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24511370#t24511370","above":24508810,"siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"12 months ago","parent":24508810,"massactions":0,"subject":"Re: EPH in the simplest possible terms","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2246029","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Frank Probst","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_2587046","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=70873652&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Frank Probst","ctime_ts":"1463515831","leafclass":"collapsed","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24508042#t24508042","name":"expandchilds","title":"Expand","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24508042#t24508042","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24508042#t24508042","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24508042#t24508042","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"cinqdroits","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://cinqdroits.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24508042,"talkid":95734,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24508042#t24508042","upictitle":"Chris Brown: pic#0","article":"Two points are worth noting.<br /><br />1. The instinct by some (otherwise reasonably appearing) commentators to endorse \"authoritarian\" answers to the current problem is very disturbing.  This cannot be the first time that potentially undeserving works were nominated for the any major literary award (\"Boneshaker\" anyone?).  The practice is probably very common although not usually this successful.  We ought to consider whether our reaction is to some extent based our strong disagreement with the nominees from the problematic slate.<br /><br />2. The amended voting system must be simple enough for voters to understand or else it will be perceived as an attempt to rig future votes, a problem anytime you are changing a democratic voting method.  As many complaints seem less about the abuse of the old system and more about our distaste (deservedly or otherwise) for the beneficiaries of said abuse, any perception of directing voters to the \"right\" choices needs to be avoided.  <br /><br />All that being said, EPH seems like it can work but could require MANY rounds of voting.  This could lead to voters eventually giving up after repeated votes, leaving only the die hards to make the final award decision.  Has anyone considered whether a two tiered voting system would work?  First vote picks top 20 works, next round picks the 5 nominees from the original 20. <br /><br />And with respect to Cherie Priest, \"Boneshaker\" was good, but it wasn't great.  I mean no disrespect to her as an author.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"12 months ago","ctime":"May 17 2016, 17:07:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Discouraging","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://cinqdroits.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"cinqdroits","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"cinqdroits","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://cinqdroits.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"cinqdroits","ctime_ts":"1463504871","tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/91237832/7059164","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24510090#t24510090","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24510090#t24510090","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24510090#t24510090","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"grrm","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":24510090,"talkid":95742,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/487818.html?thread=24510090#t24510090","above":24508042,"upictitle":"George R.R.
