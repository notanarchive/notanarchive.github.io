Mass-market paperbacks are lighter and convenient.  But <i>trade</i> paperbacks have all the extra size and inconvenience, and most of the weight of a hardback, and none of the extra protection afforded by a hard cover.  The print is the same size in both.  So it seems we get all the disadvantages of both other formats, and none of the benefits of either.  Which I suppose is fine if the reader has a choice of formats and likes the larger format, but less so if - as seems common nowadays - publishers insist on only making the trade size available for several months.  The upshot for me is if it's not available in hard- or mass-market size, I won't buy it in physical form - and the bookshop loses a sale.","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"3 years ago","ctime":"September 15 2013, 07:35:32 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"bastun_ie","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"bastun_ie","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://bastun-ie.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"bastun_ie","ctime_ts":1379230532,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/97129293/24052755","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336461.html?thread=18217549#t18217549","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336461.html?thread=18217549#t18217549","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336461.html?thread=18217549#t18217549","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"piotrazub","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://piotrazub.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":18217549,"talkid":71162,"etime_ts":"1379233534","thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/336461.html?thread=18217549#t18217549","upictitle":"piotrazub: pic#97129293","article":"Strange thing has happend to me.
