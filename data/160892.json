{"itemid":628,"subject":"Clarion 2010","event":"Look out for:\r\n\r\nGregory Bossert.  Stacie Brown.  John Chu.  Nick Farrar.  Erin Gonzales.  Jessica Hilt.  Jennifer Hsyu.  Adam Israel.  Dustin Monk.  Tamsyn Muir.  Laura Praytor.  LaTisha Redding.  Dallas Taylor.  Leah Thomas.  Karin Tidbeck.  Tom Underberg.  Kali Wallace.  Kai Ashante Wilson.  \r\n\r\nIt took me the best part of a week to learn their names -- mostly I just called 'em all \"Kid,\" as in, \"Hey, kid, not half bad\" -- and it may take you a little longer.  But you'll know some of those names eventually.  They're the students at the Clarion Writer's Workshop, Class of 2010, and I've just spent a week reading their stories, eating wretched cafeteria food with them (\"No trays for you!\"), and telling them what a proud and terrible thing it is to be a science fiction and fantasy writer.\r\n\r\nI learned 'em up good, you betchum. (\"Your title sucks.\") Despite which, most of them seem bound and determined to go on with this writing madness.  \r\n\r\nDelia Sherman taught the first week.  I was the second.  Now they're in the tender hands of Dale Bailey.  Next week Samuel R. Delany comes in.  Jeff and Ann Vandermeer finish 'em off.\r\n\r\nThat's the kind of gauntlet you have to run at Clarion.  Small wonder it's been going since the late 60s.  A \"writer's boot camp,\" the workshop has been called.  Rightly.  Which I guess makes me a drill instructor.  (But I'm a very CUDDLY drill instructor, really).\r\n\r\nIt was a great week, though.  Despite the food.  (I did order in pizza for everyone one night.   Luigi's.  Hey, pretty damn good, actually.  Better than I expected for San Diego).\r\n\r\nAnd there was some real talent in this class.  Oh, sure, talent's only part of what a writer needs to make it... craft also comes into it, along with persistence, professionalism, persistence, dedication, persistence, and a good dollop of luck.  Oh, and persistence, did I mention that?\r\n\r\nBut remember those names.  You'll be seeing some of them in the magazines pretty soon, I figure, and in a few more years, you'll be reading their books.","ditemid":160892,"eventtime":"2010-07-12 16:24:00","props":{"taglist":"writing","current_moodid":90,"commentalter":1280002141,"picture_keyword":"writing","personifi_word_count":356,"opt_screening":"F","personifi_tags":"28:4,18:6,11:4,57:8,23:4,3:52,19:8,5:10,4:29,20:4,9:20,21:6,nterms:no","interface":"web"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2010-07-12 22:24:04","anum":124,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html","event_timestamp":1278951840,"reply_count":15,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?replyto=10475132","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475132#t10475132","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475132#t10475132","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475132#t10475132","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"squirrellyguy","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://squirrellyguy.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10475132,"talkid":40918,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475132#t10475132","upictitle":"squirrellyguy: pic#95173439","article":"Sounds like you had a good time!","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 12 2010, 22:31:55 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://squirrellyguy.livejournal.com/","striked":1,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"squirrellyguy","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"squirrellyguy","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://squirrellyguy.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"squirrellyguy","ctime_ts":1278973915,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/7244050/1019731","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?replyto=10475388","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475388#t10475388","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475388#t10475388","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475388#t10475388","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tully01","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tully01.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10475388,"talkid":40919,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475388#t10475388","upictitle":"Tully: danger","article":"Tell the truth -- you ordered the pizza out of self-defense, but knew you had to get enough for everybody ....","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"6 years ago","ctime":"July 12 2010, 22:39:51 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://tully01.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"tully01","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"tully01","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://tully01.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"tully01","ctime_ts":1278974391,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/34387566/615482","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?replyto=10475644","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475644#t10475644","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475644#t10475644","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475644#t10475644","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"tsgeisel","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://tsgeisel.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":10475644,"talkid":40920,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/160892.html?thread=10475644#t10475644","upictitle":"David: Books","article":"Somewhere, not too far from hand, I have a copy of <i>Clarion III</i>, an anthology of stories from teachers and students at the Clarion workshop, including a story by Lisa Tuttle, whom you may have heard of.<br /><br />It's a shame they're still not doing that -
