{"itemid":438,"subject":"Trial by Combat","event":"Here's the latest greens from Dark Sword Miniatures for their Ice & Fire range -- the long-awaited pair of Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, and Prince Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper of Dorne, dueling to determine the guilt or innocence of Tyrion Lannister on the charge of regicide. \r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006tbfs/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006tbfs/s320x240\" width=\"218\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006w1rt/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0006w1rt/s320x240\" width=\"320\" height=\"199\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe sculpts are by Tom Meier, the one and only.  Amazing work, as always.\r\n\r\nYou can see a lot more pictures on Dark Sword's website at http://darkswordminiatures.com/ Ser Gregor will also come with an alternate arm and head (sans helmet), so you can work him up as you see fit.  He was helmetless when he faced his brother Sandor during the Tournament of the Hand, so a second diorama could easily be made with Mountain and Hound.\r\n\r\nTom is now busy sculpting Brienne.","ditemid":112203,"eventtime":"2009-10-01 15:15:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":136,"picture_keyword":"tyrion","taglist":"miniatures, dark sword","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1255208605,"personifi_tags":"28:10,17:40,7:5,31:5,30:5,16:35,3:5,19:5,20:10,9:30,22:5,13:5,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-10-01 21:27:25","anum":75,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/112203.html","event_timestamp":1254410100,"reply_count":21,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/51443191/3030116","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/112203.html?replyto=7582795","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/112203.html?thread=7582795#t7582795","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/112203.html?thread=7582795#t7582795","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/112203.html?thread=7582795#t7582795","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"hippoiathanatoi","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://hippoiathanatoi.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":7582795,"talkid":29620,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/112203.html?thread=7582795#t7582795","upictitle":"Elio &amp; Linda: Elio","article":"Yeah, those are ... well, amazing.

I can't believe that you have fans who love your work but are hectoring you mercilessly about your progress. Like you owe them a book.<br /><br />I too have been working on a project for a long time (5 years) and, after years of failing to predict the end, just asked everyone not to bring it up anymore. I'll finish when I finish. It gets discouraging to keep failing to come through for people you want to come through for. When I read some of the things that you wrote trying to make people understand I really felt bad for you, but also somewhat relieved that I'm not the only one.<br /><br />Anyway, if I can give some unsolicited advice (because I live in the place you are now) I'd like to. Screw everyone pressuring you. You don't owe them (yes, I know about publishers. They'll wait). You've written some really fine books, and I hope that you'll take all the time you need to enjoy your success with your family and your pets. You've earned it. And if you never finish DWD, your fans will be sad (me too) but ultimately it doesn't matter. It's not worth all the angst and teeth-gnashing you seem to be doing.  I'll be sad after I've read the last one no matter what, even if every little thread is neatly tied up in a bow.<br /><br />Enjoy your life, Mr. Martin, please.
