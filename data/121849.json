{"itemid":475,"subject":"Marvelous Miniatures","event":"Just wanted to share some more of the wonderful Ice & Fire miniatures from Dark Sword.\r\n\r\nFirst, some lovely painted versions of Prince Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper of Dorne, and Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, dueling for the life of Tyrion Lannister.  Tom Meier did the sculpts, and Matt Verzani painted these for the Dark Sword studio collection.\r\n\r\nPrince Oberyn:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00083gz0/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00083gz0/s320x240\" width=\"125\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe Mountain:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00084p2f/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00084p2f/s320x240\" width=\"154\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nThe Duel:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000857eb/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/000857eb/s320x240\" width=\"262\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nTom is always so exacting about scale and size with his sculpts; I love how this pairing brings home Ser Gregor's monstrous size in such a vivid and visceral way.  And of course Matt has done a wonderful job with the paint, as always.\r\n\r\nAnd while Matt's been busy with his brush, Tom has been sculpting up a storm in his studio, and we have some great new greens to add to the range.  These aren't in production yet, but look for them soon.\r\n\r\nHere's Arya:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00086wdt/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00086wdt/s320x240\" width=\"192\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd Sansa:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008ac9r/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008ac9r/s320x240\" width=\"104\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nLady Catelyn:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008bk3c/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/0008bk3c/s320x240\" width=\"96\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nAnd a personal favorite, Sansa building her snow castle at the Eyrie:\r\n<a href=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00089p4x/\"><img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/grrm/pic/00089p4x/s320x240\" width=\"256\" height=\"240\" border='0'/></a>\r\n\r\nFor more information and pictures, visit the Dark Sword website at http://darkswordminiatures.com/   And remember, miniatures make wonderful stocking stuffers for all the Ice & Fire fans in the family.","ditemid":121849,"eventtime":"2009-12-08 11:06:00","props":{"personifi_word_count":134,"taglist":"miniatures, dark sword","opt_screening":"F","current_moodid":15,"commentalter":1262489297,"interface":"flat","personifi_tags":"15:5,28:5,2:10,17:5,8:5,33:5,31:15,42:10,3:10,19:5,20:42,9:26,22:21,nterms:yes"},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2009-12-08 18:06:12","anum":249,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html","event_timestamp":1260270360,"reply_count":34,"comments":[{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/85715100/7241042","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?replyto=8099577","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8099577#t8099577","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8099577#t8099577","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8099577#t8099577","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"pyoska","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://pyoska.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8099577,"talkid":31638,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8099577#t8099577","upictitle":"Pyoska Stark, First Ranger of The Night&#39;s Watch: gamer girl","article":"A friend directed me to these yesterday.

I love HBO.  I love collecting and painting fantasy miniatures.  This world just gets better and better!  Thank goodness I am not one of George's characters, or I'd have to believe I was about to die horribly. (Also an RPG fan and enjoying Green Ronin's latest take on gaming in Westeros, but that's another topic)<br /><br />I check this site and the Dark Sword site pretty much daily, and for the past several months, this has been <i>the</i> place to see the newest photos of their greens and painted minis as soon as possible.  In this case, I refer to the painted Mountain and Red Viper.  Wow!  <br /><br />Note, the Mountain comes with different options for his head & left arm (ie. helm vs. no helm, shield vs. no shield), as does the Hound (helmet on with visor down, helmet on with visor up, and helmet off), so one could make a diorama of their scuffle at the Hand's tourney (that's where they fought, right?) just as easily.  <br /><br />I may just have to order a 2nd copy of each of those 3 guys...  Maybe even a 3rd copy of the Mountain, so I can make one of each diorama plus a solo piece for each.<br /><br />I hope they release all of these SOON (plus Aeron, Victarion, Brienne, Robb, Ghost, and any others still only in green that I have forgotten to mention), as I've been waiting for more awesome GRRM minis to be released ever since Asha and Yrgitte became available (ie. ages ago) - I want to pay for shipping just once for the bunch of them, as every time I don't pay another fee for shipping to Canada, I save enough to buy another one of these guys with a little change left over.  Just knowing that the Asha and Yrgitte minis are available but not yet part of my collection has been driving me nuts for months now.<br /><br />Once I get those, maybe painting them will keep me busy until the series (or dare I hope, the next book - no pressure; do take your time & get it right, as always) comes out...  Tom Meier's incredible attention to detail coupled with Dark Sword's realistic proportions (why aren't these guys' hands the size of their heads like the minis most other companies make?) will make these guys a real challenge not to botch up.  I look forward to it, almost as much as I look forward to seeing which one of my favourite characters Mr. Meier will immortalize in putty and pewter next.<br /><br />OK, that's enough longwinded rambling for one day...<br /><br />Jeff","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","poster":"grrm","stime":"7 years ago","ctime":"December 9 2009, 17:47:17 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/","striked":null,"journaltype":"P","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"westeros_fan","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":0,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"westeros_fan","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://westeros-fan.livejournal.com/profile","alias":0}],"dname":"westeros_fan","ctime_ts":1260380837,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/52824256/835609","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?replyto=8107769","name":"reply","title":"Reply","footer":1},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8107769#t8107769","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8107769#t8107769","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8107769#t8107769","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"sirmatthew","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"http://sirmatthew.livejournal.com/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":8107769,"talkid":31670,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/121849.html?thread=8107769#t8107769","upictitle":"Something Clever Here: Mordheim - Witch Hunter","article":"Can Tom get any more talented?
