{"itemid":1814,"subject":"Last Year (Santa Fe)","event":"My Lost Post also contained some reports on the other projects I'm involved with here in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\r\n\r\n Biggest one is Meow Wolf's ongoing transformation of the Silva Lanes, a derelict bowling alley, into a fantastic interactive art exhibit called the House of Eternal Return.  I bought the bowling alley last January, and construction has been ongoing ever since.  Of course, we're behind schedule.  Originally hoped to open in September.  Then November.  Then January.  \r\n\r\n Now it's March, but March is looking solid.  And really, boys and girls, if you pass through New Mexico any time this century, you will really want to stop and visit the House of Eternal Return.  It's like nothing you've ever seen before.  Besides, we have a giant robot and a giant spider in the parking lot.\r\n\r\n Rather than recap, let me just link to all my previous blog posts about Meow Wolf.  That should catch everyone up well enough.\r\n\r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/400257.html\r\n\r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/405122.html\r\n\r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/407659.html\r\n  \r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/447230.html\r\n\r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/449525.html\r\n\r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/457716.html\r\n\r\n  http://grrm.livejournal.com/461320.html\r\n\r\n Besides Silva Lanes, my other ongoing project is Dragonstone Studios, the former Desert Academy prep school that we've been converting to artist studios and offices.  Work is still ongoing there (and way behind schedule, like everything else I am connected with, it seems), and there's less to say since this is not intended for the public... but the building has been filling up nicely with artists, a real creative community seems to be developing, and I'm stoked.\r\n\r\n There's also some cool stuff going on down in Candy Kitchen, New Mexico at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary.  But more on that in the future, when the work is done.\r\n\r\n And there's something else... but no, can't talk about that one yet...\r\n\r\n I love Santa Fe, and it pleases me no end that I am able to given something back to the community that has nurtured me since 1979.","ditemid":464494,"eventtime":"2016-01-01 17:43:00","props":{"current_mood":"excited","current_location":"Santa Fe","taglist":"everyday life, santa fe, meow wolf","crosspost_tw_log":"[Sat Jan  2 00:41:40 2016]R [Sat Jan  2 00:41:42 2016]https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683085725915414528 ","current_moodid":41,"homepage_reposted":63986505,"commentalter":1451799501,"opt_lockcomments":1,"crosspost_tw":"https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/683085725915414528","picture_keyword":"Spain","opt_screening":"F","revnum":2,"personifi_tags":"nterms:yes","interface":"web","langs":"{\"languages\":[[\"eng\",0.593472416715368]],\"detector\":\"Lingua-YALI:0.015\",\"updated\":1451695402}","revtime":1452031722},"can_comment":0,"logtime":"2016-01-02 00:41:38","anum":110,"url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html","event_timestamp":1451670180,"reply_count":14,"comments":[{"collapsed":0,"shown":1,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/125355341/76723280","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444334#t23444334","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444334#t23444334","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444334#t23444334","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3281178","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153295916374678/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23444334,"talkid":91579,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444334#t23444334","article":"Sure this year you end up with all the plans that you propose.","upictitle":"Mario Perez Buil: pic#125355341","siteroot":"http://www.livejournal.com","stime":"1 year ago","poster":"grrm","ctime":"January 2 2016, 00:47:07 UTC","massactions":0,"subject":"Cheer up","deleted":0,"username":[{"journal_url":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153295916374678/","striked":null,"journaltype":"I","userhead_url":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/icons/facebook-16.png?v=29916?v=146.10","color":null,"noctxpopup":0,"side_alias":0,"journal":"Mario Perez Buil","inline_css":0,"attrs":null,"is_identity":1,"bold":1,"show_userhead":1,"username":"ext_3281178","user_alias":"","profile_url":"http://www.livejournal.com/profile?userid=76723280&t=I","alias":0}],"dname":"Mario Perez Buil","ctime_ts":1451695627,"tracked":0},{"shown":1,"collapsed":0,"userpic":"http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/126250853/76546896","actions":[{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444846#t23444846","name":"permalink","title":"link"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444846#t23444846","name":"collapse","title":"Collapse"},{"allowed":1,"href":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444846#t23444846","name":"expand","title":"Expand"}],"uname":"ext_3237606","loaded":1,"p_tracked":0,"commenter_journal_base":"https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10100898127212825/","statprefix":"http://l-stat.livejournal.net","dtalkid":23444846,"talkid":91581,"thread_url":"http://grrm.livejournal.com/464494.html?thread=23444846#t23444846","upictitle":"Dan Koifman: pic#126250853","article":"\"Dragonstone Studios\" sounds badass.
