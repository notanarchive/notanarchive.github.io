A pseudonym still has limited responsibility, no one is going to take 'Fartpants McGruber' seriously as a political critic if most of their blog is made up of Angry rants about the Government Conspiracy to make him flatulent.<br /><br />Second, everyone you pass on the street in a city is anonymous to you. Does that mean that the city street is lawless? Anonymity or lack of it seems to have no influence on behavior in the real world, policing and community standards do.<br /><br />Third, the enforcement is impossible and where enacted seems arbitary. What is and is not a person's 'real name', why does someone who has only one legal name have to hand over their government ID to google to be allowed to use it. Why didn't Google think about people who use Jnr. as part of their name, or god forbid have a name on their government ID that has non-latin characters?<br /><br />And finally the simplest moral counter to your argument.

But if McGruber just goes around random boards, posting inflammatory content (which trolls do, and very much so), than that is an argument for 'real names'.<br /><br />2) Do you converse with every person on city streets that you see? No? But you do read opinions of many members on a forum, who are as unknown to you as people on the street. That's one point. The second is that, while cities are being taken care of by official police who are allowed to sanction you for misbehaviour, that kind of institution does not exist on the Internet. So, another argument for 'real names'.<br /><br />3) You obviously never tried to make a false named Google account. You can make any name for yourself as a pseudonim on Google, or Facebook, or any other site, as long as it is not actually Fartpants McGruber. You can take a Zimbabwean name and say that you're from Zimbabwe. Sure, they know based on your IP address that you're not, but they make no fuss about it.
